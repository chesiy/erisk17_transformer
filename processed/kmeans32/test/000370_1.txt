Stacked up on an office room shelf.
I watch other people's videos on YouTube mostly because I live in an area where I don't get to see the artists I would like.
Okay. Thanks. I doubt I'll ever get it back but was just curious.
Dixie Chicks -Wide Open Spaces -Fly -Home
I'm not sure about a second cat now. I'm a student so I go "home" during the summer months. This was the traveling I was talking about. I'm not comfortable leaving my cat alone for weeks or months at a time even if I get someone to check on him.
Jake Owen - what we ain't got?
Kristen Stewart or Amber Heard would be at the top of my list.
I've already listened to it a few times through already. I love it! I think it's quickly becoming my favourite of the year along with Randy Rogers and Wade Bowens recent release. Same Trailer, Different Park was good but I found I tired of the music. It sounded all the same. This seems to have more variety to the tracks.
I wasn't too much of a Jason Isbell but the more I get past the quietness of his songs and listen to the lyrics the more I like his music.
Oh, Tonight
I was raised Roman Catholic and couldn't imagine leaving the Church behind or renouncing my faith. I'm more Catholic in tradition than practice (but still attend Church occasionally, etc.). My family are just Catholic, that's just the way it is. I've reconciled my faith with my sexuality over time. When I was a teenager I believed it to be a sin. Now, I just believe Mark 12:30-31; I believe in loving God with all my heart, and loving my neighbours as I love myself. And oddly enough, I think of the Miranda Lambert song "Heart Like Mine"  where she sings: Jesus, "He would understand a heart like mine". I think if I try to be a good person, go to Church, be charitable, and kind to others, than that's all that really matters. In the end, Jesus will be my judge, not man.
Emmylou Harris - Boulder to Birmingham
Yes, Kate Winslet. Titanic.
I just bought the Sennheiser HD558s. I like them enough but I can't help but feel they're just a taste of what I'm looking for. A start pretty much. I want headphones that make it sound like I'm right there, right in the room. The 558s still feel like I'm listening through headphones. Any cheap set ups for someone just starting out? I listen to mostly country.
Yes and it sucked. I was maybe 9 or 10 and this was at a daycare type center. I cried in the kid's house. One of the girls my age must've seen me cos she gave those were talking about me shit. Also, heard my aunt joking about me but I love my aunt and forgive her 'cos she just likes to joke around.
rdio.com, I'm switching to google play though. If I like an album enough I buy it off iTunes. And if I like the artist enough I actually buy the CD.
A friend actually did this. I thought it was insanely crazy/creepy at the time but he's one of those guys that just says "Fuck it" and does whatever he feels is right. He saw me shopping one day on vacation and decided he had to get to know me so while I was standing around he chatted me up. We became instant friends before I went back home. For some reason he became fascinated with where I came from and made the 16 hour drive to my hometown and stayed a week in a tent behind my parents house and got to know my town and my family. He says its one of the best trips he's made. He's actually the first and only person to ever mention how beautiful my dark brown eyes were. Everyone is quick to compliment blue/green/etc but rarely brown so I was pleasantly surprised.
I keep his toys out so he can play with them whenever he wants so I guess i'll try putting them away so he doesn't get tired of them. Play before mealtime sounds like a good idea. He's not declawed.
I actually had this conversation with a friend of mine. I told him didn't exactly have standards but was looking for someone who shared my values. Someone who believes in God, is a moderate Liberal and has strong family values since I do love kids and would love to have a big family one day. But I think I would also like someone who plays video games (BF4, Skyrim), doesn't mind me dragging them to the latest romcoms, and laughs at my dry-ish humour, and someone who has shelf full of books. I really don't like people who smoke or smoke up and prefer someone who is a social drinker who doesn't become dramatic once they've had a drink. Also, I'm fairly spoiled since I'm the youngest girl in my family, so someone who can accept that about me and doesn't make me feel guilty about it.  Edit: Forgot to add liking country music. It's 90% of what I listen to and I go to a lot of country concerts.
I like country music so whatever is on country radio.
Yep. Scared of driving but only because I'm pretty sure I'm the bad driver.
I don't mind her music but her voice is great and the only reason I buy her albums.
I have a few: Dixie Chicks, Rilo Kiley, First Aid Kit, Miranda Lambert. I have a ton more but when it comes down to it these are the singers/bands that I'll never tire of.
I'm kind of the same as well. I don't really stress out over things. As a kid the plans my parents would make was always a 50/50 of whether or not they followed through so I've learned to just roll with things. I don't make plans. If something happens, then I just go with it. I'm always surprised at how emotional people can get and how stressed out they can be. I started thinking people would find my calmness very odd so now I try to "show" more of a emotional reaction when really I'm pretty calm.
Last year I took a year off of school and stayed with my parents. I was probably unemployed for like six months while I was there before I got a job. My parents travelled a lot so I took care of their two dogs, the house, and helped with both of brother's kids whenever they needed a babysitter or needed someone to drop off/pick up the kids from school. It sucked. I was bored out of my mind. I spent my days taking the dogs for walks, visiting my grandma who lived down the street, and cleaning the house. A lot of internet surfing and watching movies.
Sounds like my kind of party!
I'm this friend. My hope is I'll arrive on time this time for sure. Nope. Now I know to add 30mins to my ETA. I've been late my whole life and it's hard to change that habit. I felt bad for my one friend. He told me he arrives at the time of the meet up even though he knows I'll be late because he can't stand to be late.
Hermione was my favourite character and I hated that she ended up with Ron. Harry made a better match.
Amazons and Gladiators. The Room. In The Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale. All damn horrible.
Led Zeppelin.
Pistol Annies - Annie Up
Jack from Lost. I hated that guy.
