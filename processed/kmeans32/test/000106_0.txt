That every community for you, And most the time its lurkers or newcomes that dont know anything about the problems faced when allowing everyone through the gates, let alone the work put to develop the game, and make it online. when an error occurs or when it lags too much, or when maintenance takes too long. Those are the first to complain, from what ive seen. But the game is in beta still, open beta, but beta nevertheless. Bugs happen, and its our jobs as testers* to report the bugs,the glitches, and anything else problematic. It is also our job to suggest things to the developers.  *We become testers once the we start playing the alpha or beta, open or closed.
What is prestige? Like what happens when you do prestige? Do I want to Prestige?
If anyone has played all the classes, Could you say which one was the most fun to play? I understand its a rather complicated question, since everyone's opinion of "fun" is a little different. What was the most fun for you?
I feel like im trying crack for the first time, and Im being teased
Which class looks the purttiest?
All i can say is the game is still in beta, Everything is subject to change till official launch , and even then they can change stuff I think.The caps are kinda stupid, but make sense.I suppose its holds a balancing factor as well. I cant speak from experience about the pvp, as im not a BIG pvper, but I assume PvP takes skill,especially in a game like skyforge. Only those who truly know their class and know how to play the game can win. Sure some classes have longer range, make it seem impossible to attack them at close range, but Im sure there is a way to beat them, if you're skilled enough.
Offline play should track stats
It may be random, but when 4 people i know get sweet tooth after getting 1 win with all vehicle ,it seems like that is the a surefire way to get it
I do a little dance when I score
That man can't be trusted, don't believe everything you read

It was Elizabeth, you can tell by the guilty look on her face.
More like a downgrade then an upgrade
ESO Moon Cycles Unlimited
I laughed more then I should have
Just imagine dishonored 2
Ahhh good game, good game. You're gonna love the ending
I kinda feel like they just took the last update they had at launch, and just fixed stuff list, and sent it out. The patch notes don't seem 15gb worthy , but what do I know? I'm just your run of the mill gamer
And commas I believe
You are dead
ESO is almost 60gb. Do some research.
Let's talk about these armored bear mounts. Will we be able to ride em, or are they npc only?
Anything like fallout shelter to play till it comes to Android?

I'm a good person, in fallout 3 I didn't blow up megaton and I disabled the bomb.
