Why are depression incidence and prevalence increasing? Some cultural factors.
Certainly in the 1950s this kind of thing wasn't looked for with any regularity and I do think much was missed back then.   I'm not sure, though, that we are getting so much better at diagnosis. Most of the clients I am referred with a diagnosis of Major Depression (on the basis of 5 minute GP interview or PHQ9 questionnaire) do not, with proper structured interview, turn out to have (or have ever had) MDD. I suspect we're getting better at OVER diagnosis, and at pathologizing normal reactive declines in mood and then encouraging the sale of products (including medications) for these. Nowhere is this more evident than in the recent fad diagnosis of Bipolar 2 Disorder, but I think that unipolar depression is also being over-recognized and prematurely medicated.  Most of the outcome literature on antidepressant medication is based on short-term response, with the assumption being that this gives us an indication what long-term outcomes will be. But the evidence favouring long-term maintenance treatment with antidepressants (or antidepressant-antipsychotic cocktails - which seem easier to get in Vancouver than margaritas) has always been shaky.   Could down-regulation (reactive to medication) in serotonergic and noradrenergic systems be accounting for some of the increased chronicity and poorer interepisode recovery?

Review of David Healy's great "biography" of Mania.
Many would agree with you. Personally, I am relatively unimpressed by my field's fascination with diagnosis. We take a difficulty with living (a tendency to fall into one of life's many traps, let's say) and call it something it actually isn't: a disease. So we take a person facing a challenge and tell them "You still have that challenge, plus now you have a mental illness" and we think we're helping.   Therapy involves overcoming the sense that one is a victim of a disorder and developing a sense of agency and control in one's life. So my bias is not to call it a diagnosable disorder and just deal with the issue. But I am often a voice in the wilderness on that point.
I recently conducted an unscientific minisurvey amongst psychologist colleagues asking about gender ratio of this type of issue, without signalling my own suspicions.  Without exception, respondents identified this as a majority-male issue. Most stated that they had not seen a woman in this situation, though some had - and I agree that they are likely out there. There are no good epidemiological studies, but I believe the life is more of a draw (trap?) for males in general.
Interesting to read these comments. As mentioned in the blog, I'm a psychologist who seems to have accidentally developed a specialty with this type of problem - through no planning of my own. Any suggestions/experiences you have might be helpful. I'd like to be able to quote you tho (without revealing identifying info or your handle) in my talk if possible.  In Welcome, Sato's problem seems to have been a combo of a triggering panic attack, low self-confidence, and uncertainty about direction. Once rolling, the problem was sustained with internet use (hard to imagine large numbers staying indoors for 4 years with novels) and - interestingly suggested in episode 23 - the luxury of a parent-supplied economic safety net.  Any thoughts about these, and suggestions for other causes or maintaining factors (rest assured I have many more - didn't learn about this from WTTN)?

The antidepressant bubble
I agree - perfect for a 15 year old boy. Shakespeare does Stephen King. (Cue outraged gasps from purists.)
I'm always happy to be disagreed with, and readily acknowledge that I haven't seen a lot of OP productions. This one was directed by Tim Carroll, who I understand is not exactly a newbie to the genre, and to me and the people near me it fell flat with a fairly mighty whump. Critics who have seen many more plays that I have also seemed unimpressed.   That said, much may have related to the level of the acting, which was somewhat uneven in this production.  In response to the comments about the importance of venue, I agree. Something might work at the Globe or Blackfriars, which are organized specifically for this kind of production. The Festival Theatre at Stratford is a magnificent theatre "machine", and I suspect some of the frustration has to do with having all of those resources (which, as I say in the article, Shakespeare would likely have drooled over) sit idle. Also, the OP format is itself artificial in that environment. They even had a complicated lighting arrangement carefully designed to simulate the gradual (and random) changes of light that might happen during an outdoor performance on a sunny afternoon.
A rant about Original Practices based on the Stratford RJ production.
Depression Leapfrog: Looking past the disorder to the life beyond.   Depression is such a difficult state that it attracts almost all of a person's attention. But making your life all about the problem can be depressing in itself. First I get up and take my pills (because I'm depressed), then I journal (because I'm depressed), then I go to my therapy session (because I'm depressed), then I listen to my relaxation CD (because I'm depressed), etc.  Sometimes it's useful to do some counterfactual thinking. "What if I WASN'T depressed? What might I be doing?" I ask clients to imagine they could eliminate depression with a snap of their fingers. (If only.) What does the good life after depression look like?  Then you can gradually begin aiming directly at that goal by doing some of those things, very gradually (after all, the depression hasn't actually vanished and is still slowing you down).

Thank you for these. Clockwork Yellow: You can see where this is going, obviously. One of the surprising things for many people is how many of these strategies we are using despite KNOWING they will make us feel worse. We don't INTEND to feel worse, so something else is going on. Anyway, I don't want to prejudice others who might reply. Other ideas, anyone?
What if you wanted to feel WORSE, not better? A survey.   I'm a psychologist and author (Your Depression Map) and would appreciate some help from any of you who might be interested.  Throughout our lives, much of our behaviour is designed with the ultimate goal of creating a positive emotional state - in effect, I want the better job, the cream cheese bagel, the Hawaiian holiday, even a sense of meaning in purpose BECAUSE I believe that if I get those things I will be happy/content/joyful/etc.  We spend our lives oriented in this one direction, and often seem to miss the target: we don't feel all that happy. Would we be any more accurate if we deliberately tried to be UNHAPPY instead? And what might we do if the agenda was to feel unhappy that we are already doing for some reason or another?  So here's the deal:    Imagine that 10 days from now you could win a large sum of money (in my groups, we make it $10 million - what the heck, it's imaginary) if you could make yourself more unhappy on that day than you are now.    The fine print: You can only do or change THREE things (maximum) in your mind or life. And you can't list anything that's not in your own power to do (no alien invasions, no global economic meltdowns). We give you 10 days, because maybe some of your strategies won't work right away and require some time to build up.  In return, I'll tabulate the answers and report back to this subreddit. (I've elaborated on this topic a bit more on my blog, but this post has all you need. The blog is at  http://www.psychologysalon.com/2013/04/what-if-you-wanted-to-be-unhappy.html)  Thanks!   Randy
The most useful mnemonic device ever. See if you can remember someone ELSE's To Do list.
Rent kayaks at Granville Island, or motor boats. Visit Museum of Anthropology, UBC, and wander the campus to the new museum with the whale skeleton (ask anyone). Go up Grouse Mtn, especially if the grizzlies are coming out of hibernation. Ignore the Capilano Suspension Bridge and go the free Lynn Canyon Suspension Bridge instead, saving $35 each and avoiding huge crowds. Eat at a waterfront restaurant like Brana's at Stamps Landing. Get a car for a few days and drive to Whistler stopping at every roadside stop en route, including Horseshoe Bay.  If you have time and the weather is right, keep going up the Duffy Lake Road to Cache Creek, then return via Highway 1 through Fraser Canyon. Visit the Othello Tunnels in Hope.  At Hope avoid coming back to Vancouver Highway 1, take the much slower Lougheed Hwy instead, with maybe an overnight at Harrison Hot Springs (1970s style bourgeois). Cross back to Highway 1 at Mission to just finish the last bit with speed.
I'm a psychologist working in Vancouver and specializing in the treatment of depression (private practice fee for service).  But let's talk about some FREE stuff:  TOMORROW, Tuesday March 26 at 7 pm at Vancouver Public Library Central branch, Alice Mackay Room -  Out of the Blue: The Nature and Treatment of Clinical Depression. I'll be there to talk about treatment issues.  It's a pretty short (1.5-2 hrs) forum, but it may be useful for some people.  ANYTIME:  Consider visiting the link below to get a free copy of the self-care guide, the Antidepressant Skills Workbook, a written-in-Vancouver (but exported around the world) guide designed for physicians to offer to depressed patients - but also for anyone to download on their own.  Here's the link that'll get you to the download sites: http://www.changeways.com/resources/aboutdepression/scdp/scdp.html  There is also a version for adolescents called Dealing With Depression (same link); I thought this post was going to be about that when I clicked on it!  Our clinic also developed a group therapy program for use in publicly funded healthcare settings called the Changeways Core Program. Mental health centres across Canada use it, and you can ask the facility you are referred to whether they are one of the ones that do.  I also have a blog on psychology-related issues at www.psychologysalon.com.  It covers a wide range of topics, but depression is one of the main ones.  It can be difficult accessing affordable (or MSP-covered) mental health services in Vancouver, but most hospitals do have outpatient programs.  One more free thing:  I have an online course on diaphragmatic breathing available on Udemy. The usual charge is $15, but redditers can sign up for the course using the Coupon Code "breathingreddit" and get it for free until the end of April.  Link: https://www.udemy.com/breathing-made-easy/  That's not much, I know. But maybe it will help a bit.
That's not a bad idea. Unfortunately it'll be a pretty boring post, and your mother could have written it. There's no magic foods, and it's best to have a balanced diet heavier on veg and protein, light on simple carbs, and avoiding sugar. Exactly the opposite of what you want when you're depressed! I might be able to spice it up a bit, though.   And you're right, there is a lot of nonsense out there. If I hear the word "superfood" one more time, I can't be responsible for my actions.
Phelps and his family have been such a bad example of homophobia that no one wants to be associated with them. Today when people think of antigay sentiments, this church is one of the first images that come to mind.   Overall, I suspect that Mr Phelps has inadvertently done more for gay rights than almost anyone on the planet. If we had a parallel universe in which he did not exist, my guess is that equality rights would not be as far along in that one.
