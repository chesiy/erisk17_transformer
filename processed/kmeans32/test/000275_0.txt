Chef's salad -- leftovers never tasted so good
yup, same engine.  Love the B5's.  Just got the brakes, tires   wheels upgraded and this thing drives like a dream now.
Any love for a B5 S4 Avant? [3264  2448]

What if a consumer wants to own two watches?  You know, because fashion...
Brian Eno - Here Come the Warm Jets [1974, Art/Glam Rock]. One of my favorite Eno tracks.
love this track...Fear of Music might be my favorite Talking Heads album
That's really cool about baltimore, I forget that Animal Collective is from there as well.   Any other new names to keep an eye out for?
Samuel T. Herring's stage presence is captivating...not sure I've seen anything else like it recently.  Check out their 2014 performance on Austin City Limits:  [Future Islands - Austin City Limits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_plqlpsII3M)
I was getting scintillating scotomas for a while over the past 5 years...shortly after moving to California from New England.  This is the first time I've found someone else who gets them.  Mine almost always would develop into a migraine, followed by nausea and then vomiting.   Super sucky.  However in the last year, I've greatly reduced their occurrence, mainly through stress reduction (they always coincided w stress and glare from sunlight).  Sorry for the overshare, just excited to meet someone else who has experienced this.

Love this KANT track.  MK does it up right.
BBRY should be fun to trade tomorrow for a day trade, and through the week for swing trade.
tried to watch it, but turned it off because Nancy Grace is more dangerous than any drug ever invented.  last thing I want to do is get hooked on that shit...
you definitely should!  there's a small group of us and we're always looking to network further and find new DJs.  I'm trying to put together a lineup right now for another house residency here in the city.  If anyone has good venue recommendations please let me know!
cute, and yet horrible.
I just meant that both the run ups on TSLA and TWTR were fueled by bullish sentiment and shorts covering their positions.  TSLA more so than TWTR.  the short float (% of float sold short) for TWTR is now just 5%, TSLA's is 48%.  Short squeezes have seemed to factor a bunch lately in these mini-stock bubbles.  It's great if you can take the plunge early and get in, but you have to be quick on the trigger for exiting.  Getting in at the peak and having no safety net in the form of stop loss orders is a recipe for a personal shame spiral.
I traded some ARIA last week.  Was going to try and ride it from 7 to 8 but volume really died off Thursdsay/Friday so I got out at +$0.18/share.  I'd watch it this next week...not sure what to expect with New Years but I'm guessing we'll have more tax sell off Mon-Tues.  Might want to wait til Thurs/Fri or week after to dive in.  Look for increased volume and whether it can break $7.40.  I still think this stock could get to $10 in the next 2 months.  It traded around $20 pre-FDA decision, and now with the amended guidelines I've heard their target market is half of what it was.  So $10 seems like something it could reach, but I've only been following it for a couple of weeks.
thanks man...just found out about /r/house this past month
