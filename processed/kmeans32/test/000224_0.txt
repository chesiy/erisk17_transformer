Will it make you like him and vote for him?  If not, why do you care? Or are you just one of those people who likes to bitch about someone all the time you don't like?

Here is their basic ideal (and why it is a sham):  We can all own our own businesses and with hard work can be rich.  If everyone owned a business, who would work for them?? We need workers.  The people in this country who get the most work the least. If we all worked 60 hours a week we all still wouldn't be making the same amount of money. So it isn't about "Hard Work". It never has been.  Those who do the actual work, the workers, at times ask for the same things investors do - a return on their 'investment'. But the right calls workers greedy when they do and whine about how prices could go up.  Investors want the same thing and prices go up? The right cheers that on as capitalism.
I think things should be a case by case basis at times.  Pot - is something an individual does that affects themselves. And while some can argue it has broader consequences that is over broad and not consistent.  Fracking - a broader issue that can affect many people (like pollution) on a broad scale. I would be against a federal ban but for federal regulations on the safety/environmental impact side of things.   It is, in some ways, pretty simple. What impact does X have on 'we the people'. If it impacts just the people doing it, meh, okay, have fun. As the scope of the action increases so should scrutiny and regulations to minimize negative impacts.
Honestly, I don't care either way. I just come here to post and comment on some news/politics/and a few other things. The bot picked me up. I get all replies to my mail, and it sent like 5/7 messages. Never heard of it, you, etc, and honestly don't give a shit either way.  But looking at reddit rules and such I would speculate that the 'joke' isn't seen as a joke and more as an attempt at harassment of others. Which no one really wants. If you are looking for a reason why one bot is allowed and one is not that seems like the most likely reason.  Just putting my 2 cents in. I do find it funny though that is labeled me/inferred I am some sort of SJW. Now that is a hoot. Damn, people on liberal boards tell me I am libertarian/a little right, conservatives think I am a flaming liberal (not fond of modern day cons myself, more old school and perhaps closer to some UK style cons on some issues).  I really don't care enough about people on reddit and their opinions to bother with bots. But to each their own. Just wish they would leave me out of it.
I don't care how it is sliced and diced, way too many shots were fired at two unarmed people in a car. The cops probably fired more bullets at that car than the entire UK police force has fired this century.  They obviously weren't even looking, just shooting - all based on a 'belief' that the people were armed. When we stop holding cops accountable we are giving them a green light to continue on this path and we will see more of it.   It is a sad day when you are more afraid of cops who carry guns than citizens that do.
Years later, Milwaukee police officer who nearly lost his job over Frank Jude beating promoted to sergeant
This isn't new. It was reported on 9/13/2012 by CNN (and presumably others).  I guess it is new to people who only cared to hear what they wanted back then and because con news sources were all whining about the video and obama not using the word 'terror' seconds after the attack.  Once more, the right got played by their own news outlets who distracted them.  Even Hillary noted it was a small group (which they were):  http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/12/world/africa/libya-attack-jihadists/  Elsewhere we see that there were folks saying it could have been a planned attack but no one was sure "at that point" (kind of like how folks aren't always sure a cop shooting someone was justified at that point until they investigate).  The admin also said they didn't think it was Al Qaeda, which it wasn't. And "He stressed Zawahiri's threat was only three lines in a forty something minute video tape. Given the language in the tape, analysts would tend not to have concluded an immediate attack was likely."  http://security.blogs.cnn.com/2012/09/14/in-attack-aftermath-disagreement-over-how-it-began/
Consider this. One of the things they often ask (not saying always, honestly not sure but I have seen it asked on the forms) is if you have ever had sex with another male. Suppose you were molested as a kid/teen. You answer yes and suddenly your aren't able to donate/sell blood.   It was (last time I looked) overly broad. Not to mention you could be much older and you fooled around when you were a teen, etc and so on.  Broad policy is too broad. It's as simple as that.
Suddenly, because of jeebus, some on the right are against their fellow humans being free to enter into contracts with each other and having those contracts recognized by the government.   Going by their views divorced people shouldn't be allowed to marry, non believers to believers, etc and so on.  I don't get it. Well, I kind of do. These super smart people are sure that God will rain down destruction on the US if gays can marry (even though they can in many countries). God doesn't care about the sick and poor being screwed over, wars like Iraq, crime, and so on. Nope. Just gays.  Your god sucks and you don't truly believe in him (Heck, based on the fundies we don't need a military, God will just swoop down and destroy the bad people....oh wait...the right pushes for more military. Maybe because they think their god is a wimp?)
APD: My Fit Foods founder arrested with cocaine
Let me guess. You're a conservative. Now, now, don't clap, it wasn't hard to figure out. Take something that someone didn't say, pretend they did, and presto - you have something you can try to use to bolster an argument you know you will lose if you don't (welfare/dependency).   Now, one could note the year of the article, 2011. Which means you are probably just trolling for comments (another sign of a conservative who can't win arguments).  But hey, carry on, fun to see cons squirming and twisting. Makes me all happy :)
Ex-CIA Director Petraeus To Be Sentenced For Leaking Classified Material
My mom put me on the bus and that was that. Sort of. She became active in the school. Volunteered her time there, got to be good friends with all the teachers and the principal. She and her best friend (whose daughter was my age and lived a few doors down) were at the school a lot and would hang out and smoke in the teacher's lounge, hand out hot chocolate to us kids who did patrol, etc.  A drone would have been easier :) but it had it's perks. I got the teacher I liked each year and me and my friend always got in the same class.
I ain't no big fan of Obama either and not a huge fan of the aca (better than nothing to get the ball rolling). Some of his policies and decisions I can certainly complain about. But, yeah, these people are just plain nuts. If he looks the wrong way while at the podium they run off screaming he is a commie mooslim who took all the border patrol away and threw open the border for ebola laden kids trained by isis.  I don't take the right serious anymore and will never, ever, in my whole life vote for a republican (which I did up until 2004, including raising some funds for ole bush).   It's like some virus from space landed on earth and took over their minds and erased critical thinking skills, courage, honesty, etc. It makes me regret saying I ever voted for them in the past. Was i that dumb or was the party a little different last century?
I have an open hostility towards some in that faith. They want to make their own little 'caliphate' here, I call em the American ISIS. Rule by religion. Kick science out of schools. Encourage discrimination of others out of fear god will punish the whole country (two men kissed? Hurricane!). Control the medical decisions of women and relegate people to praying for healing instead of getting actual health care.  They are sick people who serve mostly money and their own interpretation of some old book - which they will put above their own country.  Dangerous bigots who should be on a watch list.
Some laws remove restrictions, some fix problems (VA/etc). Not all laws are made to restrict freedoms but help the government we pay for to run better and change as needed.
Depends on your personality and age. When I was a young man I read "Follow My Leader" 14 times (about a kid who goes blind - oddly enough he was named Jimmy Carter). Then there was The Dark Is Rising series by Susan Cooper.  Sci-Fi? Start with and oldie like Rendezvous With Rama - not too intense but interesting and easy read, and fun.  Just a few personal suggestions :)
This one? Which ones was it gonna ban?  Proposed Congressional Actions      Requiring criminal background checks for all gun sales, including those by private sellers that currently are exempt.     Reinstating and strengthening the ban on assault weapons that was in place from 1994 to 2004.     Limiting ammunition magazines to 10 rounds.     Banning the possession of armor-piercing bullets by anyone other than members of the military and law enforcement.     Increasing criminal penalties for "straw purchasers," people who pass the required background check to buy a gun on behalf of someone else.     Acting on a $4 billion administration proposal to help keep 15,000 police officers on the street.     Confirming President Obama's nominee for director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.     Eliminating a restriction that requires the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to allow the importation of weapons that are more than 50 years old.     Financing programs to train more police officers, first responders and school officials on how to respond to active armed attacks.     Provide additional $20 million to help expand the a system that tracks violent deaths across the nation from 18 states to 50 states.     Providing $30 million in grants to states to help schools develop emergency response plans.     Providing financing to expand mental health programs for young people.
If I may:  I understand all too well the conditioning. And then there is the history, and community, and perhaps biggest of all, acceptance by others (family, friends, etc).  What you wanted, in being a wise old jewish man on a mountain, was a sense of purpose and knowledge that you thought perhaps would help not only you but also others (I don't know, speculating).  You existed in a framework. And you wanted to do well within that framework.   Now I would like to look at it from a different view for a moment - in part because just the other night on fedflix (old govt movies) I watched a show about Jews in Chicago, made by the police department.  I ventured to guess, while watching it, that there were probably some in the Jewish community who weren't really believers (at least to some extent). But that they knew and understood the importance of culture and history and the things which tie people together. Sure - maybe moses never existed, but the traditions passed down had a net positive influence so such things were worth keeping and celebrating because of the larger lessons they conveyed.  Religion is a mufti-facteted thing and sometimes leaders see that even when they don't believe in the facts of story. There is worth in a common past, those experiences can be celebrated, understood, and carried on. Not always my cup of tea of course :)  Anyway, sorry if I am off the mark, I am personally dealing with a lot myself in this arena (though not from a jewish perspective).
I think I confuse her in my old age with Loretta Lynn a lot.  Overall: Obama nominated her, she won't serve very long, and I don't see that her impact will be all that much given the scope of the job and the short term she will be serving. If congress approves her and Obama is for her than what I think of her isn't relevant at all to anyone.   I am pro MJ but short of some national legislation making it legal I don't see her views on it impacting much. It's not like cheech or chong were nominated. If her job is to uphold the law as it is written her views on it all won't matter a lot anyway - though she could divert resources.   What does one expect a person to say when applying for a job "I think your rules suck and I won't endorse them or enforce them"?
They will probably try to tie them to Benghazi somehow.   Also, from the article: *Rep. Jason Chaffetz, Utah Republican and Oversight Committee chairman, said the ongoing investigations undercut President Obamas assertion last year that there was no evidence of corruption in the IRSs targeting.  I have no idea how the president came to such a definitive conclusion without all the facts, he said.*  And ya know, I don't know how the right has come to the conclusions they have either about it all without all the facts, but there they are - republicans running around saying they know what happened. Weird. So maybe all those blabbering on about it should say "We don't really know anything because we don't have all the facts." instead of the gotcha headlines and such about Obama targeting them.
