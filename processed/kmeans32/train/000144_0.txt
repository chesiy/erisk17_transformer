[JM Bullion has the 1.25 oz Bisons for $436](http://www.jmbullion.com/2015-1-25-oz-canadian-silver-bison-tube-20-coins/) (25 oz).  I'd rather have these due to mintage differences.  I picked up a tube @ $439 so put my $ where my mouth is.  Both are good, IMO, but gimme the Bisons.  The Bisons are on JMB's sale page, which changes every Monday so if you're a shopping for those, I'd be a buying this weekend.
Well shit, there you go, now I see it.  Thanks!
APMEX has 10 oz Geigers for $172   http://www.apmex.com/product/78284/10-oz-silver-bar-geiger-security-line-series  This is about $3 more than [the cheapest/shipped generic 10 oz bar](http://www.jmbullion.com/10-oz-a-mark-silver-bar/) I can find doing a quick search. [Provident has one a buck cheaper](http://www.providentmetals.com/provident-metals-10-oz-silver-bar.html), but it's marked delayed so not in stock.  I think this might be the best price I've seen on these Geigers.
You sound like you're more a front-end developer than full stack, in which case you can take this off the list:  * Backend libraries and frameworks  Everything else is appropriate.  It's literally a part time job (trying to ) keep up with front-end development.
Nothing seems to ever go right for him  I don't see how you can say that. What do you know about the guy?  He's had the recent bad APMEX/USPS stolen and now a USPS misdelivering to a PO Box.  He has a lot of videos up so it seems a lot has gone right for him.  I found him via his APMEX story and I'm glad I did. He's bringing to light and reenforcing what we should all be cognizant of when buying/selling non-locally.  I felt for him in regards to the APMEX scenario.  The latest issue I don't feel so bad for him, though, as I outlined his two mistakes (at least IMO) in my OP up top.  I still think hjis experience is worth sharing here. I'm surprised so many seem to be brushing it off as he's just a whiny bitch.  I'm curious how you would handle the situations he's had. You wouldn't reach out to the stacking community in some venue?

IMO, they're essentially treating some of their inventory as loss leaders, buying feedback if you will, trying to get that power seller status so people keep coming back, new people come in with confidence they won't get hosed.  I would imagine they'll be raising prices in the future.  Not all of their inventory is a deal, as well...They have a kilo Koala for $598, both APMEX and Provident are around $30 cheaper, I think it was when I compared.  I've had a good purchase through them, though their shipping is slow if you're on the west coast.  Didn't get tracking until the 3rd biz day after the buy-it-now.  UPS Ground is 5 days coast-to-coast, so 8 day shipping for me.
You may want to take a look at http://detectmobilebrowsers.com/ It provides scripts to detect mobile browsers in several languages.   One thing to note on their about page is:  *Android tablets, iPads, Kindle Fires and PlayBooks are not detected by design. To add support for tablets, add |android|ipad|playbook|silk to the first regex.*  Odd that they don't just add that themselves.
That picture definitely looks photoshopped to me.  I've seen quite a few in my day.

Couple of thoughts, take them for what they are:  * I don't get graded coins from a modern run/mintage of 1,000,000. There is probably a ton of 69s out there (they may not be graded, but you're looking at a large mintage that could make it to the graded market). * I agree with /u/Cantilivewhileim that a MS70 would be "worth it". * The crocs are sold out at the mint so dealers are jacking the prices.  [SD Bullion is asking $26 a coin](https://sdbullion.com/silver/perth-mint-coins/2014-australian-saltwater-crocodile-silver-1-oz-bu-perth-mint), for example.  I didn't do any other comparison shopping, I just knew they had them in stock as I was browsing them this past weekend.  If you like it, grab it. 20 looks to be not quite $23 USD so it's a good price, I suppose. I picked up a tube last year, I like them.
You should make a screencast of the process from start to finish and put it on youtube. Have a "real'ish" type of project to publish, use a good youtube title and tags. For example, your thread title here isn't that great, I had no idea what the contents would be. If it was "Surge - Static Web Publishing for Front-End Developers" well, that tells me a bunch.  I search youtube quite often for front-end related stuff, I personally love video demos to discover stuff.
We work in Las Vegas as bartender/servers and pull $2k/week  And from your site:  We definitely don't need any handouts. We are privileged kids that grew up with awesome opportunities.  Yet you have a donate button on your site. Kind of a douche bag move, don't you think?
Bought my first gold over the weekend via MCM ebay.  Gold is down $16.70 as I type this, doing some shopping around, it looks like I'm down about $3 on my AGE purchase.  Spot dives aren't bad if you can get a decent deal on the premium.
*I* wouldn't do one, but that's *my* personal choice based on the resources I have available for them to make a determination.  They want me to spend time (some times a lot), but they won't spend time (I'm talking 10-15 minutes) to look through my github and ask just one *thoughtful* question.    They can ask anything they want but I don't have to jump through their hoops as there are plenty of jobs out there.  Bottom line is if you have options, you exercise them.
They're either injecting malware into your computer or they're using a popular scrolling javascript library.  For the latter, here's some I can immediately think of:  * superscrollorama * scrollmagic * wow.js  Just google those and check them out.  You'll probably want to reformat your hard drive first, get rid of that virus you and I have now.
Ah, be sure to zoom in to see MAX/buses!  I only saw the WES train/circle when I fired up the map.  What app do you use to track specific lines in real-time?  The map above seems fairly accurate.  I can see the full steel bridge from my window and the trains and buses seem to be a couple hundred feet behind what the map is showing me (trains are about 3/4 the way across when the map shows them entering the bridge).
Looking for free screen recording/editing software (Windows 7) to do programming screencasts   Hello all,  I'm looking for some free screen recording and basic editing software (**Windows 7 Home Premium**) that will allow me to do some [programming screencasts like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QO07THdLWQo).  I'll be uploading the videos to youtube.  I thought about just doing a google hangout as I'm going to be doing all the screencasts "live",  but I want the ability to stop recording my screen as well as edit my screencasts just so I'm not including a bunch of dead air/crap as I go consult APIs or hit some stumbling blocks or what have you.  I don't need the ability to do the [screen-in-screen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKmBt5HDVNI list=PLViRFZPCqDBfkfF0FFbsCVbuMzuoUV6LA) type of screen recording as I don't have a webcam (I built my own PC).  Anyone have any suggestions for Windows 7 Home Premium?  Has anyone used any of these?  * http://camstudio.org/ * http://www.screencast-o-matic.com/ (premium edition for $15/year)
This is great. I want to do the same thing but without the immediate neighbors.  Legally, are all the tiny houses classified as ADUs on the property?  What did the property prep work (water/electricity) cost?  It doesn't look like anyone is using solar?  What about sewer?
In theory, the benefits of everything that comes with either of those frameworks (MVC/structure, two-way data binding, SPA/routing, testing, documentation, etc).  I'm pretty adamant that right now is just the wrong time for us to do a new app in Angular given what we have to support.
I have a 10 oz Rarities bar, didn't pay too much of a premium for it.  Your 5 oz would probably fetch $100, IMO. That would be a "retail" price, i.e., to someone like the folks here. If you were to sell it to some type of retail establishment, you'd probably get $15-20 less, I'd guess.  I don't know if the 5 oz is particularly rare. I'd guess not so much but can't really speak with any authority. You don't see the Rarities bars much, but I don't think they're that collectible outside of being an older type of silver bar.
But [a lot of the jobs suck](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/28/business/economy/recovery-has-created-far-more-low-wage-jobs-than-better-paid-ones.html) and wages aren't growing.  Also, [labor participation rate is lowest since 1978](http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS11300000/) (change the from date up top to 1970).  Sure, you have a growing aging population, but I'm sure a lot of people are just giving up.  Do you really believe the [official unemployment numbers?](http://www.forbes.com/sites/louisefron/2014/08/20/tackling-the-real-unemployment-rate-12-6/)
I started my new Job as a Junior Web Developer this Monday, and so far its pretty good  It's only Thursday, bro.  The dilemma I have right now, is they program in many different languages with many different frameworks so there isnt a set in stone one to learn  Yep, jack of all trades, master of none.  My issue right now, is what I finished work I go home and have to do further programming to improve my Javascript skills, which does quite interfere with my social life  Yep.  meaning I do drift further away from friends  JavaScript is your only friend now.  as we often connect through playing Games together and skype, which I dont really have the time for now.      if (life !== fair) {         tears = true;         tears.fall();         delete fun;     }  I am wondering how you balance your time, while learning new skills/starting new jobs  It all depends on the life you want. Do you want to make good $ and never have a problem getting a job?  Then get used to this because it takes a lot of work to remain relevant, especially when working on the front-end.  It's literally a part time job just trying to keep up.  The Role is mainly front end based for now, but they are keen to get my trained up in back end.  Of course they are.

the price increase for silver and gold is gonna happen.  True, but as they say, markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent :)  I'm personally not buying anything until after the FOMC meeting next week. I really would not be surprised to see PM prices continue to fall this year.
*The Road* is a movie about total collapse of society, scavenging to survive, real "SHTF" mentality that does exists in the PM community. There's a certain amount of cross pollination between stackers and preppers, where you'll hear about SHTF, TEOTWAWKI (Shit Hits The Fan/The End Of The World As We Know It respectively).  A bit nutty, IMO, but to each their own.  Now, back to stacking ammo and downloading the *How to Field Dress Your Neighbor* manual.

Noob thinking of investing in silver bullion, have some questions for you all   So I'm thinking of investing in some silver bullion as part of some diversification and have some dumb questions I'd appreciate any feedback on. Perhaps eventually add some other precious metals, but would just be starting with silver.  This is a local shop to me, http://www.ajpm.com/silver-bullion.html one thing I really like about them is they post the sell/buy prices so it's a little more illuminating from a financial aspect.  According to http://www.monex.com/prods/silver_chart.html silver is at 19.71 as I type this. That local shop has prices of (bull/sell prices and I'm doing some rounding for the difference):  * American Eagle 21.22/23.32 (difference of $2) * Maple Leafs 20.22/22.82 (difference of $2.5) * 1oz silver rounds 19.97/21.07 (difference of $1) * 10oz silver bar 197.50/210.50 (difference of $13)  First off, are these buy/sell prices pretty normal from a percentage standpoint regardless of the spot price?    Second, why would I want to buy anything other than 1oz silver rounds? With a $1 buy/sell difference (at least today), that seems like the obvious choice.  Again, total noob here, any input is appreciated.
One more thing I can hate about Medium's design/ux   As if the full screen images weren't bad enough (IMO), they seem to have this awesome feature now where [you can't copy/paste text](http://i.imgur.com/w0GlxO8.jpg).  Sure, you can use a web inspector, but that seems ridiculous to me.  You can see this at https://medium.com/life-learning/2a1841f1335d
