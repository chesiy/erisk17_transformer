There isn't, dude mispoke.
Yes, I'm actually positive he was an all-star.
~~That's.... more difficult to find~~. FSU is at 92.86% for that stretch, some others:   **1954-56 Oklahoma went 31-0, 100%**   2003-05 USC went 35-2, 94.59%   1977-1979 Bama went 34-2 94.44%   1993-95 Nebraska went 36-1, 97.30%    And I'm sure I'm missing a handful of other notable ones
I just manually traced it back. You have to average 13 wins per season to get to 39, and there were very few 13 win seasons in history before the mid-90's (Bama in 92, and BYU in 84), so I went ahead and looked up the total team histories for the 40ish most successful schools in college football history, and nobody else ever strung together 39.
See my last sentence. Obviously I want to win, but I needed an inflammatory title to offset six paragraphs of questionable pontificating.
It is a hard metric in the sense that it's objective and not subject to opinion. Also I said it keeps them "in check", not that it is the end-all-be-all. I do agree with your last point, for sure.
Well spoken. Analogies to prior year teams as a dismissive or supportive argument for Florida State are ridiculous.   We are a wholly unique entity in college football history. A Heisman winning quarterback that could drag us to victory against an elite team, or throw three consecutive interceptions in his own territory; an offensive line that could get manhandled or provide holes a freighter truck can fit through; WR's that could drop passes/run terrible routes leading to INT's, or burn an elite CB for a 50 yard TD bomb. Nobody knows what we are. I've followed this team obsessively and I have no clue what they are. It's miraculous that Jimbo has managed to bring it all together for 12 games without a loss, and we deserve credit for that; but absolutely nothing surprises me about this team week to week.
Right now, we could probably use some of their linebackers.
Fun fact: no player on an opposing team has had the game high rebounding total outright yet this season. Between Harris and Vuc we're 12-0 with two ties.
Race for the winningest team of the last quarter century   Fun little tidbit: As of this past weekend, there is almost a three-way tie for the most wins of the last 25 years. School records for 1990 to present are:  Nebraska: 238-78-1   Florida:   237-77-1   Florida State: 237-67-1  There are a lot of scenarios that could play out for the title. For instance, the UF/FSU game will probably decide who takes the lead between the two Florida teams. If Florida State makes it to, and wins, the national championship they could win outright; unless Nebraska makes it to, and wins, the the B1G and their bowl game. Nebraska has a tough final two games, and if they lose out Florida could take the lead by upsetting FSU.
In no particular order, I think it will be:  1. Oregon - Survives Stanford, cruises through the final three games, and with a healthier O-line beats whichever Arizona team makes it to the Pac-12 championship game.  2. Kansas State - despite all three remaining tests being on the road, being the one elite big-12 team with very good defense allows them to win out.  3. Notre Dame - I think not falling very far after the loss to FSU benefits this teams greatly, and they make it by winning out.   4. Georgia - For the SEC West, I'm predicting Auburn to lose to UGA but beat Alabama and Ole Miss; Alabama to beat Miss. State and LSU but lose to Auburn; Ole Miss to lose to both Miss. State and Auburn. That leaves Miss St. (who otherwise wins out) the SECw champion at 11-1 and all other teams with at least 2 losses. I think Georgia will beat Miss St. in the SEC championship game and is the only SEC team to make it because no other SEC team ends the season with only 1 loss. (Yes, I realize predicting that many games is ridiculous)  I think Florida State's shady offensive line and lack of run game will collapse against one of the best defenses in the nation this Thursday, and they lose to Louisville and are out of the playoff picture. I'm also predicting Ohio State to win out and beat Michigan State, but with a weak SoS and a bad loss, they end up being one of the one-loss teams on the outside looking in.
Nope
And Patrick Ewing
In re. point 3: Let's not forget that taxing the entire value of the transaction as opposed to the recognizable income on the transaction is almost an offensively stupid idea to anyone who understands how our tax code works (i.e. not r/politics) and would never make it into actual law; though even if it did it would get quickly struck down.
That's nothing like saying the Bulls are just as good without derrick rose; look at their respective records when the pg's are playing and when they're out.   I've been consistently saying that Rondo is not near the elite point guard everyone in /r/nba thinks he is. The guy definitely has a way of sometimes completely taking over a game... but if he's never going to use it in the regular season, and can only get there 15% of the time in the playoffs, then how much can you really ascribe that characteristic to him as a player?
Lebron, Kobe, and the 2000 point season.   Lebron and Kobe both completed their 8th 2000 point season recently. Durant is the only other player to do so this season, however Melo and Harden might join them before the season ends.    First of all, I realize that 2000 is an arbitrary number, and this stat isn't too indicative of anything we didn't already know. But it's still interesting to look back and see it as a rough metric for consistency in a player's career: how many times a player averaged 25 points a game for 80 games a season (or a rough equivalent).   That is to say- it could be a rough look at a combination of how long a player was able to score at a high level without injury.    Of course things like the lockout, game pace, the 3pt line and the evolution of defenses hurt various players through various periods, so I don't think this is dispositive of anything, just an interesting stat to look at.   Here's an all-time list:  Karl Malone- 12   MJ- 11 (was 29 when he got his 8th)   Kareem Abdul jabbar- 9    Kobe- 8   Lebron- 8   Dominique Wilkins- 8   Alex English- 8   Wilt- 7 (including a 4000 point season)   Oscar Robertson- 7     Dirk- 5   Allen Iverson- 5 (and a 1989)   Jerry West- 5   Larry Bird- 4   Shaq- 4   Elvin Hayes- 4   David Robinson- 4   Hakeem- 4 (and a 1995 season)   Moses Malone- 4   Vince Carter- 3   Kevin Durant 3   Patrick Ewing- 2   John Havlicek- 2   Tim Duncan- 1   Reggie Miller- 1   KG never had one   Ray Allen never had one    Edit: I should probably point out that this isn't an exhaustive list of everyone whose ever had one. But everyone who is currently ahead of LBJ in all-time points is included on this list.
Okay :(
Not for my state, there's only a flat accounting and business credit hour requirement. I'm in law school and have taken a lot of tax classes which count for the accounting credit requirement, I have four FAR classes from undergrad, so I feel comfortable with those, but auditing slipped through the cracks.
Yeah- it's been pointed out before in this recent influx of 2B1L posts, but most of the time there are enough subtle (and sometimes not-so-subte) differences in the appearance of the cheap outfit that collectively, it would be a terrible outfit.  But then again, this is a user-content oriented site, so I think it's probably an unrealistic expectation for people to be able to compile the entire outfits themselves just for the post.  I've found that I like certain aspects of the full look; things I can take away and mix/match with my own style, in which case both the cheap and the expensive listings can both be helpful depending on how specific a thing I'm looking for. In which case, I think your complaint is just going to have to be an inherent flaw that people live with.
This is one of those "it's so far fetched you shouldn't even feel offended" scenarios.
Okay... fair. He gets no love from FM/AM though. I heard Lay Lady Lay on a country station about two weeks ago and it blew my mind, it was I think the first time I had ever heard him on air.
Nice sloooow starts, all around.
Hey buddy, relax. If we're better than the three teams ahead of us, it'll show up as the season progresses. No need to pitch a fit about only being ranked 4th in the 4th week of the season.
1) I only mentioned that because you said creaming 2 FCS schools doesn't tell you anything, you failed to mention we also creamed an FBS opponent that was 2-0, including a win against an ACC rival. Oregon, Oklahoma, West Virginia, all have considerably more shaky bodies of work right now.  2) I never said the transitive property doesn't exist. Good teams have bad games and lose by small margins to vastly inferior teams. VT got soundly worked, and clearly lost in the trenches to a team that, going into this game, had two pathetic losses. Having VT still ranked right now is just absurd.
This is exactly what I'm thinking too. Clemson's D doesn't look so great, I think FSU can put up a lot on them. But then Clemson has so many goddamn frightening offensive weapons, there's no way we're keeping the score low, nation's best defense or not.   But now I feel like a homerdouche and a jinxer by picking my team to win by 24 over a top-ten ranked opponent, so I'm not sure.
I'm not annoyed by them, it's just an 'aww that's cute' sentiment. I still remember [making memes](http://i.imgur.com/5ddfY.jpg) as a 1L.
At first I thought the author was just saying "you should find more tactful and creative ways of saying these things." But some of his commentary is just really poor and wrong (see: 2, 7). For 4 and 5 he's just contradicting himself by saying that you *should* say them, but don't do it right away. Well, duh.
2. Can you cite a source then? Do you see how the second sentence doesn't logically validate the first?  5. If you're making an argument against the death penalty, it seems fair to have complaints that are narrowly tailored against the death penalty; and not broad problems with the entire justice system.  7. Spread out across the nation? That's really not much at all, and that amount would likely be doing nothing right now other than easing municipal and state budget crises to a very small degree.   -still upvoted you though because discussion is good.
That's so cute.
wat.
Okay.
Chicken sandwich, no pickles, +tomato, then manually apply one pack of chick fila sauce. Ask for an arnold palmer to drink. I worked there for 3 years and that was my favorite item.  Runner up meal: buy the tenders, ask for bbq and ranch, dip the tenders in both packets one at a time. Glorious.  One that was only open to employees: the maraschino cherries came in giant buckets and were in a cherry juice that was substantively grenadine. Chick fila goes heavy on the syrup for their soft drinks, so the soda fountain sprite + cherry juice made the best shirley temples I've ever had.   Another thing I did (that isn't available to the public), was take the caramel packets that come with the catering fruit trays, and mix in a medium fruit cup thoroughly so it was like a candy soup.   Okay, that was actually kindof gross. But it was awesome.
