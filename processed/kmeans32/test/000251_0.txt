Often licked never beaten
I see what you're saying, but to a layman you're setting yourselves up to fail when you continually award every single large project to the same company.  No company is beyond corruption as the Public found out about [Projenz](https://www.sfo.govt.nz/n494,27.html) not so gracefully last year. And no company is too big to fail either, which would leave Chch people extremely in the lurch as most of the work going on is with the same company. That to me just doesn't make sense.  I have however seen some things in the past few months that have really opened my eyes into how contracts are awarded and Gerry's response to something he must be accused of on a weekly basis just doesn't pass muster.
You know how to look guilty as sin? Act like a twat when someone accuses you of doing something that looks like favouritism.  "He labelled the insinuation "unacceptable" and cancelled the drinks."  No improper relationship there ay?  Let's look at what Fletchers have been awarded..  * [$300M Anchor project](http://www.fletcherconstruction.co.nz/news.php? action=viewnews id=444) * [$800 million East and North Frame residential precinct](http://collaboratecanterbury.org.nz/news/fletcher-residential-awarded-east-and-north-frame/) * [EQR Contract (worth probably billions)](http://www.eqr.co.nz/qa)  And then you have the other work they've been awarded..  * [Fletchers awarded $260M Canterbury university work (as part of the Government support package, so I wonder who really awarded them this?)](https://www.nzx.com/companies/UOC/announcements/262127)  Fletchers OWN Canterbury construction work and you really wonder why people are pissed off?
Very muchly, I agree WLG were gimped from the start, but having spent a week there recently they aren't doing too badly with what they've got.  On the other hand, getting from Riccarton Avenue for instance to the carpark beside the bus Exchange, you have to go through about 5 set of lights, and cross at least 3 lanes of traffic (at a time.) which is nearly impossible for someone who doesn't 100% know where they're going. Which is stupid, road's should be intuititive and easy to use.
Thank you! Exactly. They can't just tout a lower reduced tolerance as a crash reduction parameter, while it may be a factor, it's one of many in regards to whether people crash.   I get it, speeding past a school = dangerous. Speeding (~110) on the open road when in a passing lane = acceptable behaviour  However while they do they do the occasional blitz outside schools, I've personally only seen a speed camera van down fendalton road on a monthly basis. Never once have I seen a police presence outside Burnside highschool, despite the fact I drive past daily when parents are dropping their kids off.
Fair. Sorry Reddit.
If you're in chch you can ask [Punky Brewster](http://www.punkybrewster.co.nz/) to get some in if you can't find it.   Anyway, if you're keen, pop past for a tasting to see if there's anything you like. :)
LPT: If you have EVER used a Tax Refund Company, they will always get any further correspondence from the IRD as your primary contact. Phone the IRD and remove them as your "Tax Agent" and this will ensure all IRD correspondence is sent to you personally.   This happened to my wife last year, we requested a Personal Tax Summary and despite the fact they sent it twice it never arrived, we then worked out that "MyTaxRefund" had stolen 'primary contact' as my wife's Tax Agent.  The kicker here was that we had used them about 4 *years* prior and they received personal correspondence which they never bothered to pass on!
I came here with an anti vandal sentiment, and found the comments in here quite heartwarming and I honestly can't add anything meaningful or even add even more colorful language. Reddit you make me so proud sometimes.
But it's never the rich paying for anything, their smart enough to use the loopholes provided by the government's they voted in, like trusts etc.   It's the working middle class like me (earning just above "average" wage) as the sole bread winner for my family, as I said I pay tax due to not earning enough to either hide, or to bother with hiding.   I can't get any benefits as it stands, and as you said the increase in retirement age which is going to happen (and they are bumping the superannuation up more than any other benefit) will mean I, and peers my age will be paying even more tax before we can claim anything that's not mean tested, and that's even *if* the superannuation is around by then!   Hence why "charge the rich" is joke! Direct from Google..  **New Zealand went through a major program of tax reform in the 1980s. The top marginal rate of income tax was reduced from 66% to 33% (changed to 39% in April 2000, 38% in April 2009 and 33% on 1 October 2010) and corporate income tax rate from 48% to 33% (changed to 30% in 2008 and to 28% on 1 October 2010).**  So there's your charge the rich, our government's have no interest in doing so, because the rich because put people in government.
Oh lordy. He needs to repeat this to himself each morning:  **Sometimes it's better to shut up and look stupid than to open your mouth and remove all doubt.**
Failing to see why it's the staff's responsibility to keep track of a grown man.   I'm sure the Interislander is damned if it does, and damned if it doesn't. The only way I can see to stop this happening is to ensure you hold a ticket of sorts which is stamped and crossed off vs a passenger list when you leave. (I haven't use the service but presume this isn't happening.) so while they could enact such a measure valid travelers would be severely inconvenienced by this.  And further more, by the time it reaches the destination, chances are (if he disembarked early enough) he'll be swept far out to sea.  I understand the Widow is pissed off and wants to blame someone, but at what point do we have to say shit, there's no point blaming the company as any measures taken to avoid such accidents are just pointless given if someone ultimately wants to kill themselves they will circumnavigate any measures put in place.
Family friends had a run in with this cuntbag, he had a smug fucking "I am God" attitude. Didn't even look at the fucking house, take measurements, just eyeballed it and said the infamous "This isn't earthquake damage!" Made them feel like criminal just for lodging a claim. They appealed and got their own engineer to take a look. In limbo last I heard.  From my understanding, this is the guy they bring in to browbeat people into submission. Fucking sheer arrogance personified.  Honestly hope he burns in hell for the shit he's put the chch through.
Your battery could be stuffed. Try a mates battery? (if possible?)  Try scratching your battery contacts with a sharp knife/pin?
Battery tips and tricks you may want to know.   Hi /r/Android I know we're not a help centre, but there's a lot of battery misinformation out there, I thought a post which contains some good info might be good to clear the air, and feel free to add your own tips and tricks.  * You don't need to charge your shiny new device straight from the box. In fact every cellphone I've ever come across since 2010 comes precharged to around 60%.       [Source: Li-ion does not need to be fully charged, as is the case with lead acid, nor is it desirable to do so. In fact, it is better not to fully charge, because a high voltage stresses the battery](http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/charging_lithium_ion_batteries)  * Charging every night will not ruin your battery life. The key word here is **ruin**. Unable to find any conclusive proof however. Your battery will charge to 100% and then the charger will switch off, and your phone will discharge over many hours to a preset level before the charger will flick back on and take it back up to 100%. As the source indicates, these 'microcharges' can be performed thousands of times with negligible impact to the battery capacity.       [Source: See Table 2 which indicates charging 10% can be done thousands of times](http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_prolong_lithium_based_batteries)  * Extra reading: However as evidence has [found it is best to have your device off and remove it once charged.](http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/charging_lithium_ion_batteries)  * Charge your phone in Offline mode (or ultra-battery saving mode if you have it) will significantly speed up charge time. Really handy if you don't have a lot of time and just need a quick boost.       [Source](http://www.instructables.com/id/Will-An-iPhone-Charge-Faster-On-Airplane-Mode/)  * If you've forgotten your charger, but have your cable at a hotel chances are the TV will have a USB port you can use in a pinch. (Or if there are limited power outlets and you have multiple devices to charge at once)      [Source](http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2012/07/charge-your-usb-gadgets-through-the-tv-in-your-hotel-room-when-travelling/)  * Try to avoid excessive heat unnecessarily. For instance never leave your phone in the sun on your dashboard, or by a window. Batteries really don't like being hot for very long. Once or twice is ok, but don't go making a habit of it.       [Source: "Lithium-ion suffers from stress when exposed to heat.." Table3](http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_prolong_lithium_based_batteries)  * If your phone has a tendency to randomly shut down, there is a chance your battery contacts have become too bad and need to be scratched. I've seen cellphones that wouldn't charge or turn on at all come to life immediately after lightly scratching the contacts with a sharp pin or knife.      [Source: actually my own experiences working for 3 years in a consumer electronics store.]  * Modern smartphones feed usually as fast as the charger can give it. As a result if you're hunting for a charger look for a higher amperage.      [Source: "Increasing the charge current does not hasten the full-charge state by much...A high current charge will, however, quickly fill the battery to about 70 percent." ](http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/charging_lithium_ion_batteries)  That's all I can think of for now, there is a lot of misinformation out there and thought /r/Android could be a trustworthy place for others to be confident about their battery usage.
Indeed.

This sounds like a piss take surely.
Reading the [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lundy_murders) the whole affair is actually horribly hilarious in a cruel and twisted way.  Mark was found guilty in 2002.   Sentenced to Life, minimum non-parole of 17 years.  He then appealed and this was increased to a non-parole of 20 years.  He then appealed again, and was immediately sentenced to 20 years non-parole.  **He's been found guilty THREE TIMES**  He was eligible to get out in 2019 had he been a good prisoner. Now he can't get out 'til 2022. And I wonder if the fact he still maintains his innocence will count against him in his parole hearings?
No tax bill in NZ. :)
Actually. Good point.
Sorry Cassiusz  This isn't a good look for me at the moment. I'll clean up my act!  Thanks, TehGerbil.
Thank you :)
Nice.   Looks like a very well rounded device, they've addressed quite a few complaints about the S5 - speaker placement, camera quality, build quality, fingerprint scanner, heartrate monitor, TouchWiz GUI.  And just improved upon what makes Samsung devices really nice - Screen quality.  I'm sure they implemented some wizardry with the Exynos and the AMOLED as there was an article in /r/android last night fron Engadget a while ago. They implemented stuff like ignoring refreshing pixels that don't change based upon what's on the screen, which helped up to 10% better battery life on the S5, little doubt this has helped the battery last so long despite the bump in pixels on the S6.
Why?   How long does it take then?   Do you know for 100% certain it only takes 1 year?  Why are you assuming they can do it quicker?  Edit: Call me delusional but no have no proof backing it up? Proof provided.
Thank you very much, I was drinking lemonade with feijoa flavored Vodka, the last gulp of all 3 drinks were quite bitter compared to the remainder of the drink.   I thought it was due to the ethanol sinking to the bottom of the water, but thank you for explaining it's mixed throughout the drink. I think in my particular circumstance /u/MoltenSlag has hit the nail on head in that it's due to the fizzy escaping the drink, coupled with a rise in temperature, makes sense.  Thank you kind redditor for your reply. :)
Oh I see - he checked the wrong side first? Kinda makes sense - throw in an unknown environment, I think we can both agree it just makes for a recipe for disaster..
I'm not arguing it was once a beautiful piece of kit, however consumers needs and demands change a lot over 3 years. As they don't release many other models (and certainly those don't tend to go to the same markets as the one does, they are making up consumers minds for them by saying this is the only screen size you need. Or this is the only design of phone you should ever want.    That is arrogant. And as I mentioned, design awards aside people slammed Samsung for "evolution over revolution" with their devices, yet praise HTC for doing the same damn thing year after year?   The review websites are very carefully avoiding mentioning the design copy paste. It's fucking hypocritical to the max and I'm so over the tall poppy syndrome.   You tell me you aren't disappointed the same designers who made the original m7 have failed to improve upon their design in ***any way shape or form?***
Yeah, suprising. Still one of the best resources though, obviously not something many people know enough or want to write about.
It was extremely hampered by early reviews and the narrow dynamic range. GSMarena slated it as even when down grading the competitors camera from X-4MP they still did significantly better.  (I will say except for low light, where the camera excelled but realistically most people want a good all rounder than an awesome 1-thinger.)
I really wish I could post this to the r/nottheonion/ but Stuff are such a shit tabloid news site they don't accept submissions any more from there! Anyway, this is pure Darwinism in action.   I also laughed at the fact they had comments which had to be disabled, I'm guessing due to the fact they ripped this girl a new one for actually blaming the bus for being "silent".
If I find it I'll post it!  Edit: found this, just from the news http://youtu.be/21btvNAFn98
