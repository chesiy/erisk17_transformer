Support for Sanders Grows in Unions - Its clear that Bernie, like Elizabeth Warren, has been out there speaking about the issues that are boiling up in union halls across the country,
Poll: 75 percent of Nevada voters want state to promote renewable energy
600 Christian churches call for an end to the War on Drugs
Sanders might just become some GOP-leaning voters' favorite 2016 Democrat -- and not just because he's giving Hillary Clinton a tough time. It's not hard to see some of his positions appealing to more libertarian voters like former Ron Paul fans who prefer Sanders over Rand Paul.
Addressing yet another really big crowd -- this one in Portland, Maine, estimated at more than 7,500 people -- Sen. Bernie Sanders offered his own answer Monday as to why he's become such a draw on the presidential campaign trail.
13 Emails That Stood Out From The Latest Clinton Document Dump
Wait, so a Republican candidate is promising to stomp all over state's rights if he gets elected? Either I'm missing something here or he is a even bigger moron than I already thought he was.  What you're missing is that republicans are for states rights and smaller government only when it aligns with what they want. They have no problems with the government oppressing gay rights, waging a counterproductive war on drugs, subsidizing fossil fuels, etc..
Thanks. Of course.
they aren't going to let you reroll your quest until you get a quest that lets you play the same one hero you always pick.  Two things:  1. I play tons of different characters. I don't have a "character that I always pick". 2. I've gotten practically (maybe even literally) nothing but specialist and support quests for the past week. The reason for this post is because I'm sick of playing those two roles (both of which I normally enjoy, but it's getting a little crazy). The current system isn't exactly diversifying things for me.
Kinda hard for the homeless to make use of solar panels...  Glibness aside, I take your point, that they could be giving that money to someone even more needy. I think the idea is that it's an investment. Sort of a "teach a man to fish" kind of thing, wherein the value of the solar panels over time will grow beyond the initial cost, thus the recipients get more bang for the state's buck.
I still don't see what the benefits are of legalizing it other than some hypothetical talk about how much money it'll bring in from taxes.  It's far from hypothetical. Look how much Colorado has already brought in.  I don't want people getting stoned and then possibly getting behind the wheel or doing something that ends up hurting or killing someone else.  Here's the core thing to focus on: prohibition isn't prevent people from using pot. They already are. Tons and tons of them. Many kids choose weed over beer because it's a lot easier to get. The only things we're doing by making it illegal is giving up the opportunity to regulate it, and funding criminal enterprises.   If they go making it legal for cancer patients as a pain management drug, do they really believe those patients are going to be the only ones using it?  This is a particularly disturbing comment. If you'd let people suffer in an attempt to keep other people from using marijuana recreationally, I think you really need to re-examine your priorities.  Sure it might slow down the black market for pot  When is legal all across the country, there will be no black market. If you want proof, try and find a liquor bootlegger.  the bigger problem is what pot does to you when you smoke it.  Alcohol is far more harmful than pot. Do you support a return to alcohol prohibition as well?  TL;DR - Prohibition doesn't keep people from using marijuana, and it does far more damage than it prevents (if it prevents any at all).
It's up there with [this one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YkLPxQp_y0) as best one yet, in my opinion.
Working (if you can), watching Netflix, playing a game, reading an article, reading a book, looking out the window, Skyping with family/friends, etc.. Pretty much whatever you want to do.  If you want to stare at the car ahead of you, like you would be if you were driving the car, then go for it. But I'm guessing most people would/could find ways to put that time to better use if they didn't have to concentrate on the road.  You'll basically have more options (and a safer journey) than you do now.
That's where I'm at. I've never used marijuana, and don't intend to even after legalization, but legalization is very important, and if we can get this passed in 2016, it gets us most of what a good legalization bill would, and we can correct it from there.  I know people hate this proposal, and I'd rather see something better passed, too, but I'll take "mostly legal" over "pointlessly  and counter-productively illegal" if that's what we can get.
Sure thing.
