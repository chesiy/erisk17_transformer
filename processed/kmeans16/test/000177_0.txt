Lex Luthor, Dr. Doom, Bane and Adrian Veidt all appear on Shark Tank. Who can get the best deal?   So I did this a short time ago with [heroes](https://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/3c9t4h/batman_peter_parker_reed_richards_and_tony_stark/) and said I'd consider doing it again with villains (well, antagonists since I included Adrian). So here it is. Some of this will be copy pasted from the other thread, but I made some changes to the rounds:  It's the current US Shark Tank. Each character goes on assuming a secret identity - that of a young entrepreneur in their early 20s. This eliminates the default perception of the character (ie. investors feeling safer investing with Wayne, a billionaire, as opposed to a mere Uni student). However, they keep their current personalities. **Important note: Any item pitched is free from existing patents, etc., so basically ignore issue of ownership for existing items**  * **Round 1)** Each makes a new invention designed to resolve a common household problem. It can be any problem, but must be applicable to a typical home. They have 24 hours to choose a problem and create the solution. Each has $500,000,000 at their disposal for some overnight R D. And what problem do you think each is likely to address?  * **Round 2)** Any invention they have ever made - they MUST have made it personally (eg. Adrian had Manhattan's help). Pick the one you think would have the most success from each character and pit them against eachother.  * **Round 3)** Each must gain funding for a plan to cause mass destruction. Specifically, they must pitch an item, project or service to that Shark Tank crew that can secretly be used for ulterior evil motives. For example, tricking them into funding a new brand of toothpaste that contains mind controlling fluoride. Remember, the investors will be watching the project careful, so you can't simply take the money for one thing and build a nuke with it.  **Remember to take into account marketability**, affordability (even the Shark Tank guys aren't likely to pitch in for a Batmobile), rough manufacturing costs, etc, and the individual personalities of the Shark Tank hosts. I haven't seen much US Shark Tank, but I know in the Australian version you can get an idea of which host is likely to go for which products.  Finally, major problem with the last one: The Shark Tank guys are rarely ready to invest for more than a few hundred thousand. Is getting an Iron Man suit to market at all possible with that amount?
It's just a form of investment.  Capital markets have allowed technology and the quality of life to explode.   Crowd funding isn't much different. Except the potential return/reward is a new product on the market instead of dividends.  Games like Yooka Laylee would not likely exceed of it depended on investors from acapital market, since they're riskier than CoD 18.  It's a fine system that is currently a little too open to abuse. But certainly not 'lazy'
Most of those examples aren't brigading and are no different from any sub designed at making fun of people (cringe, rage, fashion disaster subs, ugly people, etc).  The two that involves active FPH harassing cross sub are not enough to warrant an entire sub deletion or garner admin attention. I still don't think it's a convincing excuse for deleting the sub.   On an unrelated note, that chick from progress pics has an absolutely disgusting body.
Half-Life 3 was a given  I don't think so. For a while, we were simply waiting for Episode 3. Since it took so long for Episode 3 to come out, people began speculating that it must be Half-Life 3, because there is no way they'd wait all these years and just release a small followup to Ep 2.  No one really knows what happened internally though. Maybe they wanted to make Ep 3, but changed their minds to HL3. Maybe there never was meant to be an Ep 3. Maybe they purposely decided to backbench HL3 to work on more lucrative projects. Maybe they simply kept delaying it for one reason or another and realised one day "oh shit, we're sitting on another Duke Nukem Forever".  Valve is too secretive and we don't know.  However, at this point, working on Half-Life 3 definitely would be 'going back' as it's a project that's been in limbo for awhile, not something they've been consistently working on.
For some reason, only specific websites are loading for me.   For example, I'm browsing Reddit and GameFAQs flawless. I can Google search just fine and I'm downloading a game on Steam.  However, most websites return[ this message](http://i.imgur.com/NeyK7eF.png) (including Gumtree, eBay, Paypal and others).  Disconnecting and reconnecting to my Internet connection (through router settings) seems to breath temporary life into my connection, causing some (but not all) of these websites to work again - although usually they won't work. It's often the same set of websites, but not always, that give issues. It's the majority of websites that DON'T work. Occasionally I crawl to a snail's pace even when everything is working.  This has been happening for months. There are periods where it will be like this for days or even a few weeks, followed by periods of flawless browsing. I have replaced all the hardware (router, cords, filter, etc) I can and tried multiple browsers and devices (the websites that don't work are usually consistent between theme).  Finally, sometimes pages will just partially load - usually a lot of text on the far left side of the page (basically, only the text loads with no formatting or images).  So... what's up?

This is what gets me. She's fine for three movies, then she does a few things in one movie, and people act as though this is the entire character. It's classic tumblr cherrypicking.
No problem!
No, opinions are fine on ELI5. You're acting as though they are worthless. Opinions, supported by reasoning, precedent and logic can still potentially be valid and are just fine in lieu of facts. The only issue is if it's presented as a fact, which 004forever didn't do, it's clearly an opinion.  Edit: You're fucking retarded.
Way, I was even further off than you guys. I thought it was "gotta love those Starbuck's lovers", as some sort of stab at the hipster movement or... something.
I fail to see how that's relevant to what he's said. I've seen them all in order and I still agree with him. They're just bad movies, but the hype train won't end as long as there are fans to eat it up.
What was he supposed to do? Get out and challenge them to fisticuffs one at a time? What if he doesn't stand a chance at winning, or they gang up on him?  OK, so that's a bad idea. Well... drive away? Wait, they're surrounding me, I might bump into them. "Sorry Mr. Drunk Asshole, I'll put the car in park and let you ruin me financially and destroy my livelihood"  How about the third solution. Oh wait there isn't one. I guess we'll let violent people just walk all over us.  What's your solution exactly? I'd like to hear it.
How can I go from not being able to do a single sit-up to 45 by the end of the year?   I need to pass a fitness test that requires: 25 pushups, 45 situps and an 8 on the shuttle test score.  I can easily beat the 25 pushups and shuttle run score, but I've never done a situp in my life. I can't even manage one. The form they want you to use is placing your hands on your lower thigh and move them along your leg up to your knee. I can get about 2/3 of the way up there and just can't get any higher. I can't even do one rep. I DO NOT get anyone to hold my feet down, I have to do it unassisted.  I need to be able to pass by the end of the year. What's a good place to start?
How is this game for single player only?   Basically, I've been travelling a lot lately and this is the first day I've had to get on the Internet in two weeks, so I haven't kept up to speed with this game. I am about to go without Internet for awhile again in a few hours and I'm thinking of picking up a single player game to kill some time.  So, tl;dr, how crucial is the co-op to fully 'experiencing' this game? Is it like Borderlands, where I can still enjoy it single player, or is it more like Left 4 Dead where the emphasis is on multiplayer?
Planet of the Apes takes place on Earth all along   So I've rewatched the original movie a couple of times since the reboot has been out, and I noticed a few things over the course of the film that I believe support this hypothesis.  First, before I go into this, you have to keep in mind that Taylor and his crew traveled FORWARD through time for many thousands of years, giving enough time for all the necessary changes to take place. Now, onto the evidence.  Firstly, when Taylor arrives of the Ape planet, he discovers that it is perfectly hospitable. The right makeup in the air, the right distance from the sun, drinkable water, etc. The odds of this happening are actually incredibly slim. Even an amateur astronomer can tell you that. It's not definitive proof, since there could be some fluke that makes an equally habitable planet with the same landscapes and sky as Earth, but it's highly unlikely and is a big hint that this planet may be Earth right off the bat.  Secondly, evolution is a very complex thing, and it is not conceivable to think that by sheer luck, a second planet would evolve humans, apes and horses on it AND that Taylor would happen to land on that planet. This is absurd. The apes and Taylor also share a common language - English. Whatever happened on Earth during these few thousand years to eliminate the humans and cause the apes to become smart was not enough to eliminate written and spoken language. The apes adopted this language as their own, allowing Taylor to communicate with them. Also many of the apes names are also human names, clearly adopted in addition to the English language.  Third; at the end of the movie, Dr. Zaius hints at some sort of catastrophe. Something clearly happened on this planet and could explain its current state - like a war that reduced the humans to small tribes allowing the apes to take over.  Finally, the very last scene shows Taylor confronting the statue of Liberty, an Earth structure. His inititial assumption is that the statue of liberty was blown up and the debris traveled through space. I suggest that the statue has been in this position all along, just decayed with time... **EARTH**
Lucious Fox is Batman   So it's been a pretty big secret to who this Batman character really was with many characters discussing the possibilities throughout the movies. But I think I have gathered enough evidence to show that Lucious Fox was indeed Batman the whole time.  1. Lucious had access to all the technology that Batman had used throughout the series as the head of Wayne Enterprises military contracts division. This can be clearly seen from all the scenes in which he is showing off the technology to the Bruce Wayne character. 2. The movie spends a disproportionately large amount of time focusing on Bruce Wayne and Harvey Dent for some reason. Why? So it seems more natural to have Lucious Fox on screen. 3. Lucious Fox CLEARLY hints at being Batman in the scene where he is confronted by that accountant dude or whatever. 4. Batman dresses in all black. Lucious Fox is black 5. Why the Bat theme? Bruce Wayne has a fear of bats. Lucious spends a large time around Wayne. Wayne most likely relayed his fear of bats to Lucious 6. There is no other likely contender from the movies main characters (Dent would be too busy during the day to go around at night crime fighting, Alfred is too old, Gordan and Batman are seen on screen at the same time, Bruce Wayne is too busy working out, taking tours of the military contract division, hiding from the public eye and playing with bat themed military gadgets to go around crime fighting) 7. I zoned out of the movies a lot to be honest, which means that there was probably LOTS of evidence I overlooked suggestions Lucious is Batman, which is EVIDENCE IN ITSELF.
What is the strongest monster Geralt of Rivia could beat?   I know these sorts of topics are starting to become a bit disliked here, but I'm really interested in this one.  It's Geralt from the books. He has been hired to slay the beast and thus gets a reasonable amount of prep time (say a few days)/knows what he's getting into. He has all his swords and any potions from his universe available to him. If the monster has a weak point, he is aware of it. The monster is being introduced into the Witcher universe for this battle so Geralt can only use the resources from that universe to create monster traps or whatever will aid him in the battle.  The battle takes place in an environment that the monster has chosen to settle down in. Ie., if the monster likes swamps, it will naturally habitat a swamp somewhere in the Witcher universe for the fight.  Also use a loose definition of the word 'monster'. Basically just keep human-like species and superheroes out of the mix.  TL;DR: What's the strongest monster a fully prepared Geralt of Rivia can beat.
