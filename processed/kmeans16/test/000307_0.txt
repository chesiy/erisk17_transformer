thanks for the tip!
ha ha; the held back is probably partially going for a softer style and partially psychological from being in a dorm room!    No, I have never had singing lessons, but I have been singing on my own my whole life really, and in my church's choir for a handful of years.  I have noted drastic improvements from when I first started recording (six years ago *shudders*) to now, but I know there's a lot more I can improve on.     As far as the mic goes, yeah, I actually did three takes of this because I got too into it the first two times and got intimate with the mic, causing distortion; that may also be why I was holding back.  Anyway, thank you for pointing that out; it helped me realize I am still holding back sometimes in here, and that I still haven't found the sweet spot to sit from the mic in this new setup.  thanks for listening!
I would think that as long as it is different enough, or only a slight preview, it doesn't matter, but I don't really know.   I'm just basing that off of PenPal from /r/nosleep .  The author took the series, fleshed it out, exapnded upon it, and then published the result as a full-fledged Amazon book.  However, the original stories are still online on nosleep
Drama: He bided his time before asking her out.  Even once they were together, he carefully observed her actions and words; he was the attentive listener women say they want to find.  He made sure to be there for her whenever she might need him.  Although she led a busy life, he would always clear his schedule for her.  He had come to love her favorite restaurant almost as much as she did.  He could see them growing old together, and going to that cozy restaurant by the pier for every anniversary.  Then, he got a phone call which made his whole world shatter.  Comedy: She thought he was a nice guy, and he seemed to be really interested, so she figured she could give it a shot; it's whatever.  She lied about having to work late sometimes so that she could hang out with her superficial friends instead.  He always seemed to give her even more attention after such nights.  It's funny how a little distance can make people want you more.  She chuckled at the thought of him chasing after her like a confused puppy. He made some of the silliest, and to her mind, stupidest faces sometimes, especially when he just looked at her.  He was a real clown.  She kept going with him to the same restaurant on the pier; she could think of nothing else to do with him other than have good food and good fun.  Although it was her favorite restaurant, she was getting tired of going there; they had worn it out.  So she picked up the phone.  -----------  [I know that's not really funny, but when I read the prompt, I thought of this sort of relationship, and how to him its serious (drama) but to her its just a game (comedy).  hope you like it anyways ]
People laughing in your face man.  The one time I ever got suspended, I was in 10th grade (year 11 for any Brits reading), I was scared and devastated, kind of internally losing my shit.  The particular assistant principle who was asking me questions and filling out the paperwork was a real jerk to me.  I'm not saying I deserved to be treated specially or anything like that, but I believe I deserved a basic level of human respect, you know?  In my fear and anxiety I asked a kind of silly question, which he could have just answered matter-of-factly or maybe, maybe chuckled at, but instead he more than guffawed; he outright laughed out loud to my face when he answered me.   This of course only served to make my fear and anxiety (about what awaited me at home) much worse.  I was in trouble though, so that's one thing.  Last semester, I am in Grad school btw, during a meeting about our theses (dissertation in other nations), just to go over general guidelines, I asked a serious question about the scope of the topic area (trans-atlantic comparative policy as opposed to a purely European focus), and the professor leading the meeting did the same obnoxious laugh in my face and rather than saying "yes, people have done that; it fits the program name well." he said " *guffawing laughter* well it has to have some European element to it; otherwise, why are you in [this] program?"  Thanks; thanks a lot.  Made me want to leave the room at the time, but it was a mandatory meeting. He made it clear that he didn't think I belonged there when it came to my assignments too, but it's ok.  I'm not the one with a problem, so I don't let these things get to me.
yes, people do; I personally don't have the patience for it.  I'm sure it gets faster and more effective with practice, but starting out it takes an insanely long period of intense concentration and I'm just not up to the task.    A friend of mine did it in class when he was little and freaked people out.    now, something marginally easier which I have accomplished is using energy to manipulate electronic devices.  It has a visible physical result, but the energy doesnt have to be converted into physical kinetic energy; it remains as an electrical impulse just as it started in your mind, which is my understanding of why this is easier to do.    My most successful experience occurred, in 8th grade, out of necessity, which is key actually; unless you are really practiced in these things, for it to work, you have to **need** it.  There is great power and energy in desperation.  With which I incapacitated 7 overhead projectors in various ways (as I did not specify a method in my intention).  The great necessity felt by my 13 year old mind?  I had trouble reading from those antiquated projectors and I did not want to be made to get glasses.  My desire to not have to get glasses was a really intense need to me.    The point of adding that last detail is that, **need** is relative.  It's the energy created from the need that fuels this.    Being full of energy as you are, you probably don't *need* the **need**.
as far as the second 2 are concerned, read this and maybe get your eyes checked https://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/31bkpi/meta_psa_see_something_out_of_the_corner_of_your/  Although I have had things disappear and come back, as have we all.   The beiber thing is interesting.  In relation to the first one, someone else recently posted about having seen a movie before it came out so maybe talk to them? http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/31cev8/i_saw_a_movie_before_it_even_came_out/
the same way that we all have the ability to sense when something is wrong with a friend or family member, or when you get that feeling that something is not right....you could call it picking up on the vibes, or feeling/reading auras from people, but we all do it; just some people have honed it as a skill and can do it better, or are more aware of doing it.  He must have really really needed to pass gas, and you were just receptive enough at the moment to sense that vibe and urgency radiating from him.  It's a perfectly simple and logical explanation.    Still a funny story though.
you did a decent job; that is actually good concept art.  Just take your drawing, and the pics of the individual items, to the tattoo shop, and the tattoo artist will draw it better for you.  That's what I did with mine.  (By better, I mean a better-looking Pikachu for one, and a pointier style butterfly wings on another.)  Their improvements to your concept art can be major or minor, depending on the level of detail and the style you are going for.
yeah, like I said on the original post; it sounds like this is a spirit you can peacefully co-exist with.  Just try not to think about it, and when things happen, don't worry about it; just dismiss it, unless it's really bothering you or causing some sort of inconvenience or discomfort that must be addressed; then, just nicely ask it to stop.
ah ok; yeah; I just got that impression from what your mom said couple with your incredulous wondering if you did it, lol.  I think others may have got the same impression.  this may be an episode of somnambulism, or it could be someone else (living or dead) messing with you; if so, that could almost be taken as a threat.  But if it's been a while and nothing else has come of it, I wouldn't be concerned.  Particularly, given your mom's statements, it is likely sleepwalking/sleepmoving.  you may have used scissors or a knife on the sheets in your sleep, but if you did that, then that's scary in and of itself.
harmless poltergeisting  I'm skeptical of that statement.  I mean, I understand what you mean (moving stuff), but...that can escalate/ go south quickly; but, again, that depends on the nature of the spirit.  So, again, look up the history.  A friend of mine has a ghost on her property which I did not find out about (having never stayed there long enough) until like the 8th time I'd been there.  we were standing talking.  there was no one behind me, and something thunked/flicked my purse.  I felt the tap, but there was nothing there to have done it.  I expressed my surprise, and then she told me about the boy who was killed in a fire there, and who sometimes messes around in the house.   he's been around for many many years, and is clearly harmless, not a vengeful spirit.    Just make sure you look into the history, ok?  can't stress that enough.  edit: to clarify, I was getting ready to leave, and thus, I was wearing the purse (handbag) when he thunked it, which is how come I felt it.
I grew up in the south, but my whole family is from NY (deets here http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2yft7m/what_accent_do_you_have/cpc5zf7)  So, in the south they say I have a neutral accent, but in the north they say its southern.  But I do not say y'all.  I have always said "you guys"
I was raised bilingual (english and spanish) , and I just realized this last year
"If I never see your face again, I don't mind, cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight."
yes, all the time.  Everyone has them occasionally.  dreams are metaphors for/ based on the things that we are thinking about or have subconsciously picked up on during the day  / things we don't want to admit.   To be more specific, my most recent one was, interrupting the middle of a dream's usual craziness, I wound up at WalMart with my mom to return a pack of socks. When I woke up in the morning, guess what we had to go do?   now, in the dream, the socks were white.  The real ones were black.  But still.
