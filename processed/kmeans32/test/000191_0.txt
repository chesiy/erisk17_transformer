[Question] TaiG won't recognize iTunes?   I'm trying to jailbreak my iphone 5s running on 8.4 but the TaiG installer is telling me "Apple driver hasn't been found. Please download and install iTunes". I don't really feel like re-installing itunes and having to go through ratings and playlists again. Does anyone know of a fix for this?
In my mind its simple, it is a dwarf planet, based upon new information that wasn't available when it was first discovered. Things change, we have to adapt. If you still consider Pluto a planet, why? (besides the fact that you like it, or want it to be a planet, that holds no scientific meaning)
Yea that's one of the things I've heard, I'll have to do some research on it
Do you have any recommendations for beginner programs? I have been lifting since last september though, but not too seriously until a few months ago when I finished school and started the cut, and have seen some good muscle developments and have been able to increase what I'm lifting despite eating at the deficit.

So I have two different packages of plain cashews, yet one has 310 cals per 1/3 cup and the other has 227 cals per 1/3 cup. Why is there a difference? Shouldn't it be the same since it's the same food?

Can someone make all the colour in this photo black except the red circle within Jupiter?
I'm getting a solar system tattoo soon without pluto, simply because it isn't a planet anymore. I don't feel any attachment to it, and there's nothing worse than having a scientifically inaccurate astronomy tattoo.

How do axial tilts change with respect to the sun?   If i am using this picture (http://rossmannellcomments.edublogs.org/files/2013/12/Planetary-Axial-Tilts-1qtzpi8.jpg[1] ) as a reference for the axial tilts of the solar system, will these numbers always be correct? Could they also be negative instead of positive depending on from where you view the planets?
