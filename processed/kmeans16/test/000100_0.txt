i just want to say this.    Don't give up on the b2gdroid platform.   it has a HUGE HUGE potential im totally unaware of but i know it exists.   Yes, its not bug-free but please continue to develop and erase all the issues.    I was instally in awe of the UI on b2gdroid; and its very very good on usability and friendliness.    Keep developing!    Once its ready launch it on the playstore as an homescreen alternative and take-off from there!    One Major issue- battery drain. Please fix that. And if rolling nightly releases are available things will be much better for tester's.
what i mentioned here is for personal usage.(i don't want to blamed for some problems on a larger scale later on - hope you understand; and everything can be fixed with a reset/refresh)   Since these things will become enabled in the proper way once things hit release.   But if you insist use this addon for mass setup - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cck2wizard/    Not sure how it works but perhaps the right one for the job.   Also:   https://wiki.mozilla.org/Deployment:Deploying_Firefox    Above stuff include parameters for linux
For me it all 'just works' works now.    My initial install only involves partitioning and hitting next-next-next on the installer screen.   Its really a breeze these days.   Graphic card is the only addition work I do.(windows also requires nvidia drivers)    Since nvidia is going for optimus(Hybrid cards) i use the bumblebee package; for other nvidia cards a package from RPM fusion is all it needs.   Fedora 22 pretty much identified everything on its own wifi, camera etc. Hell even my wacom tablet works - plug and play style.    The other fine tuning i do which isn't system level stuff is install vlc, freetype-freeworld(for MacOS like font rendering) and apps like MyPaint, Krita, GIMP and Inkscape for drawing and Blender for 3D.    Have VirtualBox also incase i need a Win environment within Linux for testing and Wine for some stupid windows only apps(which i rarely use these days)    Have another system with Ubuntu and it works great as well :)
:)    webM is still under development, so unless you want to take it out on a test drive to find bugs etc. its better to turn it off.
Valhalla Awaits :D   Edit:  Tried it out and i love it! It works fine as well as the gtk2 version for me.   Looks pretty neat on Non-Dark GTK themes.    Few Issues:     * There are few readability issues on the Dark Theme versions(Numix; Adwaita) on GNOME like the drop down boxes on booking.com and initial loading of google.com shows the search bar as black before turning white.     * I wish we could get rid of the BIG FAT title bar, but HTitle add-on is quite the savior.   * And in "Get Add-ons" there is a big white space at the bottom  * Amazon tab keep stopping and showing the spinner every second before it completely loads.    * Scroll bars disappears on booking.com drop down boxes while scrolling from bottom to top - Date; Month.    Typed the edit on gtk 3 :D
i hope my aero knowledge helps me here...   That paint will give give a better picture of real world conditions.   Wind tunnels have streamlined flows and is limited by the model size and wind-speed generation.   when you have a car testing out on a track you'll get more accurate flow patterns(especially turbulent nature), i hope they record the footage because that's the way you can infer the data you gain.    For eg. on the front winglet side below CNN [3rd pic](http://imgur.com/a/CwxBt) you can clearly see the 3 vortex shapes   2nd pic - a good part of airflow is going into the side vents
:D good!
Technology wise - yes, i believe it will atleast by the next few version Firefox will come on par with things already implemented by chrome and go beyond as well.     We need Mozilla and Firefox to exist for an open web, even if Usage etc. go down, because i don't think anybody preaches/pushes forward an Open Web like Mozilla. We had 'works on IE' before, that got addressed well and now we could see that situation rise again.    Only when people/users make switches can the trend change for the better.    Usage   Adoption - this depends entirely on a persons perspective. If a person feels chrome is the best thing on the planet, then you cant change him/her. Other who have a different ideology, say they value privacy or OpenSource/Standards developed software a lot, then Firefox becomes the best choice for that person.   It really comes to a personal choice and if you're willing to make a change.    EDIT   Non-tech savvy people - they would be least bothered. They just want something that works.   Only way to change them is to educate them or market better(which Chrome is all about).   This is one crowd that has to be considered because for them defaults/ad's and marketing make it the best product.
It certainly is possible, you just need the right color palette.    Digital Painting isn't that bad with gimp. Once you get a hang of the brushes and brush settings your work flow will be smoother.    Path tool can help you with sharp edges or strokes.   Also use layers, definitely helps and saves time on mistakes.     If you're trying to Make something of the face mash thing like the images you posted, know how to cut out images properly. Use layers, set warmth tones, use curves, blur and clone tool.   Edit - combine multiple software like krita, mypaint and Gimp, you'll finish much faster
Firefox for Android  Notes (37.0)
Still no luck:   MIME Type: video/mp4; codecs="avc 1.42001e mp4a.40.2"   DASH: no(18)    Just to clarify, tried this out on a fresh profile.   I only have the top 3 box's (HTMLVideoElement, H.264, WebM VP8) enabled on the YouTube HTML5 page and the rest disabled. MSE disabled by default.   If i do enable MSE then vp9 kick's in most of the time, but it currently has A/V sync issue's among others which let the devs to disable MSE on Linux.
yup it does! :)  Edit - watch comment below
ah yes i get what your trying to say :)   i have a couple of emoji font installed on my system to help me out.   I just felt this could be better since the user doesn't need to do any-end work

For a better Internet - The Web We Want- free, open and more!   Over the past few year, so many policies and controlling measures have come in to the world on controlling internet usage.    We have seen SOPA, PIPA, NSA, NETRA(india), CMS(India) etc. that have been proposed to control the flow of content and hamper sources over the internet.   This Clearly breaks the foundation of free speech, privacy among various other issues.    Please take a stand and Join the effort - http://mzl.la/QQRcMM  YOU are the change and YOU are in charge!    Our voice maybe tiny but it definitely leaves an impact in the world community, which the internet truly is, a global one.    NOTE - Though you may or may not be a user of the Firefox browser. Please consider sharing this piece of info of your fav. social networks!   It is no way a campaign to download the latest Re-designed version of the Firefox Web Browser(but if you do download/use, thank you for keeping the community strong)
Damn you've got to be kidding me.    Linux has Bug report systems like ABRT, Bugzilla. And they do a Better job than Send Error Report(which i haven't seen fix any errors).    I dont know if you mean Autodesk 3ds Max, Maya, CATIA  as poorly designed apps. But ive got a heck load of problems when i used to work with them.   And as for so called "unix distros don't have any central company to supply updates"   Maybe you should use Ubuntu or Fedora and see how wonderful they handle updates.(That includes core kernel updates without breaking the system). Also you're able to Upgrade the entire OS to the latest version from these central repositories.   I use windows for my gaming, i love it for that. Its the only place it shines.  For work its Linux, because its reliable and stays solid
