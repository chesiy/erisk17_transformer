Wonder Woman / Classic Film Mashup Poster
Actual film composition is all conjecture at this moment as we know absolutely nothing about:  a.) shared screen time.  b.) Lex's power suit (armani or armor)  I'm just talking looking at them side by side in the abstract.  Eisenberg is known for playing an introverted nerd type and Cavill is ripped - even if not to comic standards (much like the airbrushed standards women face).    I'm just saying, in terms of spirit - they are quite opposite.
