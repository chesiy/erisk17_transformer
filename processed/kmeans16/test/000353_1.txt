Yeah he moved across the country, essentially to be with me.  And when he did I was so sure without a doubt that we would be together for quite some time.  If I do end it, he probably has to move back home with his parents, and that would be it for us.  No chance ever again if I decided it was the wrong idea.
I agree about the relationships evolving part.  I've really thought about it.  I'm a pretty big "realist" when it comes to romance, marriage, etc, I've always known that love isn't like in the movies, or that sometimes, you love them, you just don't always like them, as the saying goes. But sometimes... I find it's not just rut, it's that I'm literally not attracted to being with him.  We haven't had sex in about 3 months (partly because of an illness on my part though) but I find myself not wanting to...with him.    I think part of me wants to be independent too.  Whenever I used to think of milestones like graduating school, moving to X place, buying a house, whatever, he used to be there in my mind.  But now it's just me.    It's like in How I Met Your Mother, where Lily leaves because she doesn't know who she is outside of their relationship.  I don't now who I am, how can I properly give someone else love?
Good point.  I just feel like I've screwed up so much.
That was very useful, thank you :)  I guess part of the problem is I don't really have a family support system, even if they are far away.  Some stuff transpired that kind of ripped us apart, for a silly reason I think.    We are very lucky.  I am glad to hear that someone who has been there is also feeling better, it makes me happy :)
Oh right, I forget that there is a drinking age sometimes.  Eh, once you pass 21 instead of being like "let's lower the drinking age so all these younger people can drink!"  you're like "oh screw it, I had to wait that long to for it to be legal"
Yup, thank you random internet stranger :)  If you're in the southwestern US ish area, I'll grab a beer with you!  Highly unlikely you're in my area though haha.
I took six years of French... but 6 years ago.  My mom is even fluent, but I don't remember a lick of it.
That was a very nice poem.  I'm saving it for future reference for myself to look at later :)
Good point!  I guess I did feel a little better admitting to someone that something was wrong.  As hard as that was, I am extremely stubborn, but I still hit my breaking point.
Hahahahahahaha... and not the "haha" that people type without laughing, no I literally laughed out loud at that.  I'm not sure why, maybe because I took French for many years, and don't remember a thing.
Hmmm, link?  I tried a small Google search and the top like 3 pages were about "de boss rooster"...
Haha, I have no idea if the "man" in that was thinking I am male, but I am not.  But I say "dude" all the time anyways, no matter who it is!  But never "bro"... never, ever "bro"... I think the thing that kills me the most is that I did this all to myself.  And I'm sitting here crying about my life when people affected by Sandy have no homes, etc.
Makes me feel better to hear that from someone.  The doctor was like "You should feel great in a week!"...Uhhh...I do not. Not even close!
I get that.  This time last year when I was drowning in coursework, etc, I never really hated it or felt like leaving it forever.   It's hard that most of my friends in the program are not only going to medical school (many have already been accepted, ridiculous) but are *supposedly* just loving their projects and feel like they are in the right place.  I am definitely the outcast of the group. But thank you :)  Any advice from anyone is truly appreciated.
Thank you :)  It is nice to talk to positive people.  I'm usually a fairly outgoing positive person, but the last few months have definitely taken a toll on me.
Recently diagnosed with depression, I feel scared and stuck   Hi everybody.  I've been a lurker on reddit for a little while, but I need somebody, anybody to talk to.   I was diagnosed with depression about a month ago, and was put on Wellbutrin.  That's all fine, but I feel like nothing will change unless I change what is going on in my life, but I feel like I can't. I'm currently in my 2nd year of a 2 year Master's program, and honestly?  I don't want the degree. I have realized that science research is not my thing, at all.  I don't even slightly enjoy it.  The only thing I enjoy about it is that i can be a TA. However, I am in debt a little bit from it.  Everyone tells me "the hard part is over!  You only have a few more months!"  but those months include smashing out a long thesis over a subject I absolutely do not enjoy.  I don't enjoy any of the program at all.  It is not what I want to do.  I'm not sure what career path is for me, but this is not it.  Also, I live with my boyfriend of 2.5 years.  And... I've been considering breaking up with him.  A lot.  I just don't feel the same way about him, plus I don't want to be tied down to the same person since I was 21 (I'm 24).  It's hard to describe, but it hurts.  I've voiced it to him, but we live 3000 miles from any family, so we're stuck in this position.  So, I'm not sure what to do.  Or if anybody has ever had anything like this feeling before.  That you are stuck in the life you are in, and there's nothing you can do to change it.  To top it off, I'm not sure if the depression is causing all these feelings about school/boyfriend, or if the school/boyfriend is causing the depression.  I just don't know.  If anybody has any advice, I would really appreciate it.  I am new to depression, and very scared.   TL;DR--have depression, hate current life and feel stuck, I feel like I can't escape without causing big problems.
