[Intro] I'm new!   So I was just looking to quench the boredom thirst when I clicked the "random button" above to find this subreddit and I am already hooked! I have read so many stories and everyone here seems so genuine and nice. So I thought I would give it a go and write my own intro (ha! that rhymed). I am a freelance prop maker and love to sculpt and create as much as possible! I currently work at Alton Towers, UK and in my free time love to make Youtube videos [most resent video if your interested](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cj0uUM3fzc4) One day I hope to run my own business of prop making/cosplay weapons and costumes. Anyway, HI!
Opening Credit Song!

DIY- Fake Chocolate props. Can be used to make any food!   Hey there, first time posting to here so be kind. I made fake chocolates for a zombie movie and wanted to share with you how to make them for yourselves.  What you will need: Chocolate of your choice, Silicone, Super glue, A tile (or a surface silicone will not stick to), Fact Cast, Paint, Brushes, Stirring stick.  This process is super quick, simple and easy and you can use it to make any fake food.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhp9l2vu24
