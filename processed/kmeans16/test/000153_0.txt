Did anyone else enjoy Ant-Man more than Age of Ultron?   Not sure about you guys but I'm getting a bit tired of the avengers fighting a large army I'm hoping infinity war will rectify that with Thanos all I want is the aveners vs Thanos thats it.But with AOU I think I was starting to get a bit superhero fatigue because there were just so many heroes involved.   I like how Ant-Man went back to basics. It was small up close and personal and it was a solid origin story and it was just overall a more enjoyable film for me.
pretty sure thats fake.
if marvel is still casting spider-man this late the that means one of two things....   1. Spider-Man must not have a big role in Civil War and they are filming around his scenes until they cast someone  2.Negotiations with Asa Butterfield are taking longer than expected and marvel and sony are getting nervous so they are looking at alternatives in case negations fail.   just some food for thought.
[no spoilers] What needs to happen for season 4 to be good   I think there needs to be a time jump in season 4. Have season 4 take place 1 or 2 years post season 3. That way they can get as far away from it as possible. Have Oliver and Felicity develop a proper relationship during that time off screen so we don't need to see her cry every time Oliver does something she doesn't approve of and they wont have to mention anything that happened in season 3 ether except for maybe Saras death then they can jump straight into the action in season 4. Have some devastating event that causes Oliver to come out of retirement and return to starling city and bam just like that you got season 4 the rest is up to the writers on what story they have planned hopefully its something awesome.
Anyone else feel like Age of Ultron was just a giant setup for things to come rather than be its own movie?   Mean while Civil War will actually be the big kahuna that we're all waiting for and marvel decided that age of ultron along with ant-man were just a bridge to fill the gap while we wait. It was almost like a filler episode of a tv show setting up and teasing whats to come and didn't really move the plot forward aside from meeting some new characters. Maybe this was intentional or I just picked up on it due to Whedons background work on TV? It just felt like an episode of a tv show that plays before the finale you know what I mean?
yea its fair. i liked the first movie and loved guardians and cap 2. I found the first half of ultron a bit boring and tedious to get through.I didn't start appreciating the twins till the second half of the film. It definitely shows that Whedon is running out of ideas and its probably a good thing hes not doing infinity war. id say its fair. Ill be a bit worried if it keeps dropping though.
Had to google this cause I never heard that Joss was actually pissed about it but it seems like he actually is from what I read which sucks because I think Idris was just excited and accidentally let it out I don't think he purposefully did it just for attention like some articles make out he did. If he is cut from AOU because of this I'm glad Joss isn't doing Infinity War he seems like a bit of a dick imo but im sure there's more to this than we publicly know.
Take a break! seriously people take your 15 min break or however long you get! Get some fresh air or get something to eat. Do something just get out of that chair and put that headset down every chance you get otherwise you will go insane.
I got mine from study link. Here in New Zealand .Its basically a subsidiary set up by the government and offers interest free student loans. You can also get a student allowance which is free but is dependent on how much money your parents make which will impact how much you get per week. Or you can get living costs which you have to pay back on top of your student loan up to $175 a week.
The Witcher 3 Runs at 30fps on PC   Here's the link to the original polish interview.   http://www.gry-online.pl/S018.asp?ID=1132   PC recommended specs will be able to run the game on 30 or 60 frames per second?   I think, we'll stick with 30 FPS. We're not going to stop working on performance until the very end, it's crucial matter to us, there are different PCs with different specs. Programmers insisted on avoiding tricking the players by lowering predicted specs. As I mentioned before, It can only get better.
This seems to be the "cool" answer to any half life 3 related post these days. But we all know you will still buy it day 1.
[Stories]Have you ever stolen anything? If so, what?   I remember back in high school stealing chocolate bars from my local super market and putting them down mah pants...back in the day. I was young and shit and quite the rebel to ,hehe.i remember being pretty good at it to tbh. I also remember getting away with some whipped cream and later spraying some of it all over some poor buggers car and then threw it down a ditch some where on my home. I also remember getting a way with a copy of Command and Conquer tiberian sun from a local computer store.
it comes out in August thats more than a few months away but you are right. we should of had a teaser by now.
yea i was gonna say wtf man, taking your computer and tv sure thats what burglars do but to steal a mans bed? fuck your asking for trouble now son. A man needs his beauty sleep.
I must say after patch 1.3 the game is now more than playable on pc.   Havent played the game since release on pc so decided to try patch 1.3 and I must say even though there are still some bugs that need to be worked out like still being able to glitch in walls and swimming in mid air lol in terms of frame rate and just in general the ability to just play the game without stuttering its a huge improvement. Just thought id add my two cents.   Specs of my rig.   I7 4790 8GB RAM GTX 660 2gb
what to expect from the force awakens teaser trailer?   Im expecting a bunch of emotional character close ups, maybe one VFX shot and one last shot of something that will make the fans have a WTF moment to build hype for the next year. I heard the last shot of the trailer is meant to be the villain holding vaders helmet or something?
