Rivaldo used to be my favourite player, i had the up most respect for the guy! Pretty mush idolised him and formed my own game around his style! Then [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mo4oUnpcmws)is happened and my opinion of him changed dramatically!

She just sent me this in reply to you - " I don't know how to cut the hair of a fidgety pig. We have two restless piggies, but they both have short hair so I haven't needed to cut theirs. Blob (the longer haired one) just sits still. Could try putting the piggy on a table and distracting it with a pile of grass while you trim the hair. Just be really careful of nipping the feet, ears and their bits and pieces below.   I just used a pair of sharp scissors, but apparently proper hair cutting scissors are better. You can get these 'scaredy cut' scissors for easy (and non-dangerous!) grooming....  http://www.scaredycut.com/"

Arcam Alpha 7, Award winning CD Player. Needs a good home!   I'm moving house soon and have to shift some of my audio equipment, this CD player is in Mint condition and comes with all the original packaging and the remote control. The only reason I am posting it here is because I would rather it went to a home where it was appreciated and set up with the right kit to get the best out of it.  So if anyone is interested make me a reasonable offer. Thanks guys.  http://imgur.com/a/B6xtJ

Unfortunately that inst the case and the stuff has gone right through me taking everything in my stomach with it. My toilet is absolutely decimated!

To be fair Rusko is known for his Dubstep. However the original version of "Hold on" was a fucking monstrousity! Although not being Dubstep the Subfocus remix was one of the tunes of my summer!!!
