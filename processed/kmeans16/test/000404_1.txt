Well the thing is I don't know. I know some animals will reject their young if you touch them. I have also heard it's also generally bad to touch fish because you have oil on their scales and you can damage them. I also once handled a little Australian ring tailed possum after I tried to save it from a cat and I covered it with a towel and put it in a box. It physically was fine, with no cuts or anything but then it bit me and a couple of seconds later it died. I was told later that they have weak hearts and sometimes they can die like that.   Anyway I'm no veterinarian so I can't give a good answer but I think some animals have a higher tolerance for human interaction than others.
I sent you a PM with the details.  Also I forgot to mention that there are some institutions that don't use Mortgage Brokers. For example HSBC, which actually offered a pretty competitive rate. I also checked out CUA (Credit Union Australia) which had a competitive rate (I think mortgage brokers do use these guys but thought I would mention it anyway). Though there are discounts to take into account with the major banks, so you can't always just work off the advertised rate and you need to find out about each one.
I used to work at a Federal Government agency and quite a few people moved from interstate (all over the country) to work in Sydney.  They all used a rental property service. This was paid for by the government agency. If you can get your work or your partner's work to pay for it that would be ideal, but if not I think the service is worth the money.   I'm sure there are a few around but just do a Google search for it. http://www.sydneyrentalsearch.com.au/  I'd highly recommend it.
That's what gets me. When they grow up their whole life will have been documented online... and have had no say in it.
The thing I'm looking forward to is walking down George Street and it actually being a pleasant place to be, rather than having to get off the main street as quickly as possible and yelling to talk to your friends, because you have to compete with the bus noise.   I get the bus most days and would be okay to get light rail (I used to get the light rail sometimes), except I hope they don't put those shitty old carriages on the new light rail. They really suck, and give me motion sickness. The old carriages are so much better.
Honestly if it's in my direct path, I just pick it up and put it in the bin myself. I don't really care about getting my hands dirty. If it's really gross I have a pack of wet ones in my bag.   I was standing at a bus stop and there was a newspaper from the local grocers flapping around all over the pavement. It was driving me nuts because it was about to blow everywhere. I just picked all the pieces up and put it in the bin, while the other 10+ people just stood there and let me do it. Maybe I'm a crazy old woman now or something but argh. I have nothing else to do but wait for the bus.
I don't know if you've heard of him - David Ireland, Wildlife Man - but he always loves to pick animals up that don't want to be picked up and while he's talking he flails them about in the air.    He did this with a Shingleback and it was so angry at him. When he put it down it didn't really try to run away it just looked at him like it was evaluating it's options on how exactly it was going to take his life. I tried to find the video on youtube but I can't find it. :(
Oh that is good to know about Copper Mountain. I heard the name on TV while here but that's all I know about it.   Yeah the beer here is pretty nice actually. I didn't know Colorado was into craft brewing but it's pretty sweet to try the stuff here. Unfortunately I didn't try too much. The bus back from Aspen to Snowmass is deadly to weak stomachs as one poor sod on the bus and all the rest of us found out. What I had was wonderful though.  We put our house buying plans on hold for this trip. The property prices in Sydney have spiralled out of control so we sort of gave up for the time being. When I get back I think moving out of my tiny unit into something more liveable might have to be my next goal. :)  So happy to hear I'm not alone in my goals. Except opposite countries... you know what I mean...
I know I'm just some random person on the Internet but please don't give up. People do shitty things because they're imperfect, not because you do or don't deserve it. I know what it's like to care about someone and get shat on. It's terrible, gut wrenching and soul destroying. But you're still important and I hope you will give the world another chance. I hope you will get through tonight, then tomorrow, then the next night. And I hope sometime you will see that your life is worth it.
I am one of those people that overanalyses my day to day life and I always feel like this. Sometimes it helps if I lay in bed and think about where I am right now and analyse just the present. It gives me a short reprieve from everything outside of my room and I am just in this moment right now. Maybe you can try it.  Like right now I am typing on an iPad on my bed and the air conditioning is on which I am glad for because i hate feeling sweaty when I'm about to sleep. I'm a little tired and have a headache but I'm glad the day is over. I'm not going to think about tomorrow... Just the next 5 minutes and I'm focused on this message and thinking about how when I sleep my mind will shut down for just a few hours and me and it will have our daily short but very necessary holiday away from each other.
No problem at all! I'm glad you heard my words and that I could brighten your day. :)
I ate maccas everyday for 6 months cause I was working full time and studying and didn't have time for a lunch break. It was so convenient to drive through and eat at traffic lights. I got pretty sick :(  Recently I hadn't had maccas in months and then I got it the other day and sat next to a really stinky homeless guy. Now I associate maccas with smelly people and I don't crave it. KFC is so much better :) Luckily it's not convenient for me.
Depends if you want to go on a weekday or weekend and what time, and I don't know your price range but I just thought of a couple of places I've been off the top of my head you could look up in the cbd:  * Max Brenners near Wynyard station * GPO cafe (not sure of the name) - There's 2 inside * La Guillotine behind Town Hall (actually a restaurant) * Lime Cafe * Boy Charlton Poolside Cafe (http://www.poolsidecafe.com.au/cafe/home/) - good on a nice day  Also try this link for more: http://www.citycafes.com.au/Sydney_cafes
It sounds like you have a lot of really good advice to share, so I thought I would ask a question. It's a bit detailed, but I would greatly appreciate any advice on how to deal with my managers.  I have been working at a large government organisation for 18 months and am quite junior.  Although I'm technical I can see a major problem with the organisation (it is primarily a business issue but has ramifications for IT), and I previously raised it with the 2nd in charge (sort of like COO). I regret that I didn't have a solution at the time, as he asked me what I suggest we need to do. I told him that I would need some time to think and reasearch a solution. After I explained that I may offend my managers for raising it directly with him and not my immediate manager, he said he would send an email inviting me to sit with him and with the head of IT to discuss my ideas.   After this meeting I told my manager that the 2nd in charge would like to discuss my ideas, and he said I needed to present to him first. I saw that as a good thing as it was a chance to get some valuable feedback.  However, since then I've moved to another manager in the IT department, and this manager would also like me to present to him first, and then if he approves I can present to my senior manager. After presenting to the senior manager, if he approves then I will be able to present to the head of IT and all the other senior managers. If they are all okay with it, then I will be able to meet with the 2nd in charge to discuss my idea.   I believe this process is going to take a few months and it is quite frustrating, as this is just an idea (and hasn't been approved by anyone yet, and is primarily a business idea), and also the 2nd in charge has asked me to go see him.  I don't know what to do in this sort of situation. I know I can go directly to the 2nd in charge and say that I am still very keen but I have been asked to present to others first before I can talk to him, but I know that will annoy a lot of people. I have spoken to my manager to explain that it wasn't really necessary to present to all senior managers first before going to the 2nd in charge as it was more of a business issue. He couldn't give me a good reason why I had to and in the end said he would talk to the head of IT to see if we can just present to him.   I just feel that they are putting up roadblocks for me and I am not doing this for me but because I really honestly believe that the organisation will benefit from this (and I have attended senior business meetings where they have raised issues relating to this problem that affect the work). The main reason that I think they are doing it is because it will probably create more work for the IT department, but I believe that if the business thinks it is important then that is up to them to decide and not IT.  I would just like to know what you think is the right thing to do in this sort of situation?
I rear ended a car this morning... I tell you, it was going to be a REALLY bad day!  The driver got out of the other car, and he was a DWARF!!  He looked up at me and said "I am NOT Happy!"  So I said, "Well, which one ARE you then?"  That's how the fight started...
I tried this at my work too, but only had my crappy phone to take a photo with. You could see heaps more than without the tape, as in make out objects, but it was pretty blurry.  http://imgur.com/yBJI6.jpg  That is looking out of a meeting room into the photocopier room! The photo is of tape on the frosted side - I could see both into and out of the room.   Tried putting tape on both sides of the glass (frosted and non-frosted) - this made no a difference to the level of distortion compared to when it was only on the frosted side.  Tried putting tape on the non-frosted side and that didn't do anything - I couldn't see in or out!
