Great Sports Illustrated piece on Mudiay to people who don't know his story: http://www.si.com/nba/2015/06/24/emmanuel-mudiay-nba-draft-congo-china-texas-smu-larry-brown
From your [Wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordie_Howe_International_Bridge#Opposition), evidently the freaking Koch Brothers are involved too.    In early June 2011, the conservative group Americans for Prosperity posted bogus eviction notices on homes in Detroits Delray district. With the words "Eviction Notice" in large type, the notices told homeowners their properties could be taken by the Michigan Department of Transportation to make way for the proposed new bridge. The groups state director said the fake notices were intended to get residents to contact state lawmakers, to ask them to vote against the bridge project.[38]
You're projecting your thoughts into my head. My ideal solution is one single state where Jews, Christians and Muslims are living wherever they want and worshipping freely. If you call the death of a Jewish-only state as genocide, then you are deluded.   The terrorists, the ISIS types, the ones who actually wish a military destruction of Israel would fight against "pro-Palestinians" if Israel is out of the way. They give Israel's military a justification, and most of us don't like that. It's why we have our own organizations and don't work with them.   I want what happened to South Africa to happen to Israel. Last I heard, when the apartheid there ended, there wasn't some genocide of white South Africans. Now, prejudices there still remain, but people there aren't subject to discrimination and massive human rights violations.
I live closer to the Amish than you do, lol. We probably live in the same state. I consider myself practicing, and no, it is not a sin to talk to you. Many Muslim women who cover wear jeans, actually most of of the young Muslim women I've met in the states wear jeans.   Women aren't required to have a man escorting them everywhere. In some of the more conservative Muslim countries,  sure, that rule is there and it is misguided, but the lack of education of many there makes it a safety issue for women.   I've been to Iran, Pakistan, Iraq (mid 1990s), Syria, the West Bank, Egypt, Dubai and Jordan, and I've seen women walking around all the time on their own without a male guardian. My mother and sister got to work every day on their own and both wear the hijab.  We use modern technology,  unlike the Amish, and we tend to wear all types of clothing, unlike them.
Meanwhile millions of Muslims go through live every day, going to school, going to their jobs, raising their families, living their lives as ordinary citizens, throughout Europe and the United States, not bothering anyone.   Except you though. Because you sat behind your computer screen, read a couple of articles about some out of the blue, rare, abhorrent actions, and decided that those actions defined an entire religion made up of a billion plus people.   I can see some radical, sitting behind a computer in a far off Muslim country, hearing about a terrorist attack in response to a U.S./coalition bombing and thinking, "You can do your Do-As-We-Say shit in the U.S. or Europe, but here we will not tolerate it. We will not have non-Muslims control our behavior through violent acts."  You aren't quite that different from that radical. He doesn't have the benefit of an education, so he might do something stupid. Thankfully, all you'll ever do is post stupid things on the internet and continue thinking stupid thoughts.
I guess you can waddle back to BCND and tell everyone how P S disregarded the article because of the source.  Can you honestly tell me how that is helpful to any discussion? What's done is done now. It seems you're having a bad day, and I'm sorry if this article was just the straw that broke the camel's back. What do you think about the article? Is it unfairly prosecuting? Does the officer in question have a compelling story or does something not add up? Please, I mean no offense.
Please, enlighten me.   Posters in this thread are judging the story by the domain name, and I see few comments on the actual content of the article itself. i didn't post here to provoke or insult police officers. I wanted to see the genuine opinions of police officers on this subject, positive or negative. Is anyone willing to say anything?
LOL, I just came up with it. I am South Asian myself. One day we get a national team Desi. Considering how most of us aren't that tall and cricket isn't really taking off in America, we should be playing more soccer.
And now you're claiming America's soccer games can't be good! You monster! /s  You have to understand, we American fans are a bit sensitive to criticism from people who look down on MLS and other soccer played in North America. Our league is a lot better than what people who don't watch and/or live overseas give it credit for.
You didn't read the article. Evidently America cares if other countries wish to boycott Israel because, as the article points out, congressional representatives are working on a bill to take punitive measures against countries that boycott Israel.
If you can get CM Punk to a Chicago Fire game, that would be a match made in heaven.   The Union = one or more ECW and/or ROH stars.   Seattle = Daniel Bryan.   Portland = Don't know any wrestlers from Oregon. Maybe Roman Reigns just to troll.   NYCFC = Zack Ryder!   DC United = Batista  Columbus = Dolph Ziggler or The Miz.   RBNY = AJ Lee is from Jersey.   Toronto = Edge/Christian.   Montreal = Kevin Owens/Sami Zayn.   I'm sure there are plenty for other states, but off the top of my head, I'm out.
Neither was a hate crime? Yeah, ok. Who says atheists can't be right wing, anyway? We don't know (**EDIT: changed from now) about his political views.   And you found one supposed false accusation, never mind that there's no web link. Congratulations.   We have politicians like Bobby Jindal claiming there are no-go zones when that has been debunked. We have people frothing at the mouth when you don't call terrorism "Islamic" or "Muslim," never mind that most of the victims are Muslims, and we have people claiming that Muslims don't condemn terrorism. As Chris Christie put it, "I'm tired of dealing with the crazies."
Gave me a nod so you can say it got pretty serious.   http://i.imgur.com/5pOdc.jpg
It's a different Juninho. [He's only in his mid-20s.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitor_Gomes_Pereira_J%C3%BAnior) The one you're thinking of [did have a stint in New York but is now in Brazil.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juninho_Pernambucano)
You're saying that people of different races will never get along, so we should stop trying to live near each other and cut ourselves off as soon as possible. This effectively legitimizes racism. This is the argument that white supremacist groups use today and the argument behind the segregation of old. It seems I have more faith in humanity than you do to live together with equality regardless of race.
[I made it one of these! Woohoo!](http://giphy.com/gifs/EXzrnapKb8U92/html5)
