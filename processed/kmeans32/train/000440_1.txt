It makes you feel numbish... We just wanted to feel numb. It sounds stupid but, if you knew our emotional states, it would make sense to you.
Very serious, me and my friends took zoloft...   One of us took 100, I took 150, my friend took 150. We all feel sick. I take 100 a day normally, and my friend that took 150 normally takes 75. Are we going to be okay?
Relapsed on cutting last night   I feel like a fucking failure.
I'm in highschool and I already feel like it's just going down from here   I already *had* the best time of my life, and now he's gone, it's said and done. I tried to kill myself (and failed, obviously) just to escape the inevitable downward spiral. Now, I'm just a girl with "psychotic depression" and an extremely pessimistic attitude. The pils? Make me feel like a zombie. I'm empty inside and I just want to die.
I stopped seeing a psychiatrist because of my mother not taking me. A talk would honestly be great...
You might be a sadist by nature, which isn't necessarily "bad". However, if you are *really* hurting others, it's not good.
Had a very bad break down in school today. Not even sure I can make it through the night.   Long and heart wrenching story short, my bestfriend, who was my boyfriend for a very long time up until he tried to kill himself a month ago and came back saying he wanted a break because he might be gay. Well, today, walking to lunch, I saw him holding this girl M's hand... I don't know what came over me, but I screamed "I can't! No!" and ran into the bathroom, where coincidentally my best friend Chloe had been. I started screaming and crying and, apparently, I said "I just want to die" a few times. M, who has actually been making mine and his life a living hell for months, came in and started yelling at me, saying "What the fuck is wrong? Is it because w were holding hands? He's gay, get over it!" and I just died inside at that point, because, if he really is gay, I'm losing everything I had at one point, indefinitely. I guess I kept asking her to stop but she wouldn't so Chloe made her leave, and while Chloe was gone, I threw up all over myself while I cried. A counselor came in and took me to the office where my favorite teacher (guy. funny. suffers from anxiety and depression) let me just vent, since he knows everything I have gone through with bestfriend/boyfriend person. I had to write an incident report because of what Madison did and shit. I got calmed down and when I finally started walking back to class, I saw M with bestfriend/boyfriend's beanie... I died a little and went to class with tears in my eyes, as always.   After that class ended, I went to bestfriend/boyfriend- let's start calling him J- and said "I don't think you mean to, but you're breaking my heart." and he just looked at me and said he was sorry, and explained him and M have *nothing* going on at all, and he just held her hand for a moment to calm her down. I explained how awful it is, since I used to mean everything to him and now I feel like I mean nothing at all to him. He said, and I quote "I never meant to push anyone out, especially not *you*. You still mean a lot to me. Like, a lot, I just..." I then said "Do we have a chance anymore, J?" to which he responded to by shrugging and saying "I don't know." and then he gave me a hug and I whispered "I'm sorry" into his neck and he just gave me the saddest look I've ever seen and went into art  textiles...  I know he really doesn't know. He's not saying it because he doesn't have the guts to say no. He's just extremely fucking confused with everything at the moment. This is the first time since he got back that I've actually expressed that this is effecting me negatively, and I didn't even *really* express it to him. Two of our friends are going to talk to him about this tomorrow, because they are both quite pissed about the way he's handling this, especially after today...  I miss what I had, and I don't know why I feel so broken. I really just want to die, to be honest. It would feel a lot better than this... I'm cutting again, I've stopped taking my meds... I just... I've been suffering in silence for a month. Today, I broke that silence, but in the wrong way, and to the wrong person...   Sorry for that wall of text.
I'm pretty sure it's usually accompanied by a psychotic disorder (schizophrenia, bipolar, etc) but apparently some symptoms that separate it from just good ol' fashioned depression are delusions, anxiety, agitation, cognitive impairment, constipation, and I saw the term "hypersexuality" in a few articles that I can't recall the names of at the moment.
Mom is constantly pushing for me to "change".   Okay, so, I'm 13. Basically, I have psychotic depression along with an anxiety disorder. When I started freshman year last September, I started to sink more into my depression. I also began to go out with my best friend (not together at the moment; he might be gay) who also has depression issues- she decided to blame him and my other friends for my "sudden change". I'm pretty antisocial in general, and I absolutely fucking detest my mother. Sue me. She is a 29 year old woman who pretends her life is fine when really she is an unhappy person. She decided the best way to make me change would be t punish me. I got my phone and laptop taken away for a month. It didn't work and just made matters worse. She threatened to pull me out of school, I didn't give her a reaction. Could not give her that satisfaction of letting her think it was going to get to me, and honestly, it didn't, because she never followed through. She sees this as a contest, almost a "let's see which one of us breaks first". What she doesn't realize is I'm pretty damn persistent, so if she wants to turn this into a contest, I'm going to win.   Honestly, her antics don't even bother me that much anymore. What bothers me is that she turns every conversation into an argument by bringing up "change" and ragging on my closest friends. She then gets mad because I don;t give her the reaction she is looking for. My mom wants me to be a happy-go-lucky, straight A (already am, btw), "family comes first" kind of girl when that's just not who I am. I don't place value in family because they're the people we end up with randomly, and she didn't even raise me. My friends are my family, and to be honest, I think she envies the fact that I care more for them than her.  How do I deal with this? Do I cave first? Help!
It's like you go 3 steps forward only to get thrown 30 steps back, right? Let me tell you, these are things that happen in life- most people just don't have to deal with them all at once, maybe not even have to deal with some of them at all. I really am not trying to be generic here because I am going through a very similar experience (very different situation, same feeling) things pass. After a while it doesn't seem like the world is ending and you learn to cope.
Have you ever just stayed up doing something to the point of exhaustion to avoid that "in between" time of trying to fall asleep?
I'm about 9 years your junior, but, I feel that to a certain degree, I understand what you've gone/are going through. Everything bad seems to happen all at once, dog piling on top of each other. It sucks. I'm not gonna lie, it's really difficult to cope with everything. I'm not sure how to really address this, but just know if you need someone to talk to in an effort to keep yourself from doing something *permanent* as a solution to a somewhat *temporary* problem, PM me.
Not wanting to shut off the lights to go to sleep because the time spent falling asleep is too unbearable? Anyone else?   I don't really know how to describe it. It's like, I won't want to close my laptop because I know it's keeping me up, but, at the same time, the period of time spent in the quiet darkness before falling asleep is too bearable to deal with because of my thoughts. Anyone else?
I usually say "I had a very intimate encounter with a thorn bush."
I would hate to see you die, knowing that you can come up with ideas like this. However, I would definitely watch it, especially since I've been in that place before and want to know if the experience(es) is the same for everyone.
I have mental illness as well... Do you think that could be negative as well?
But, he made me promise not to see other people. Does that change anything?
It's not like that, trust me.

Boyfriend becoming distant and depressed, trying to help everyone.   Alright, so I'm in highschool. I've been with this guy for a really long time, and even before that, he was my best friend since middle school. We have a pretty solid relationship for the most part- no trust issues, no fighting, etc. However, I have depression and anxiety, he has depression, and we both aren't in the best situations involving family. He has gotten really depressed, and because of the parent he's living with, he can't talk a lot outside of school, so we have gotten a bit distant.   I am that type of person who has relationship anxiety and needs constant reassurance, which is not healthy whatsoever, and I am receiving help with that, however it is still hard to believe that he loves me, blah blah blah. So, him getting distant has been very difficult, especially since we have two friends (both girls) who's lives are just as wrecked as our's. He feels the need to take care of everyone, so he's trying to keep them, me, and himself up all at once. However that usually ends with me being ignored.. He says he doesn't want to ignore me, or make me feel like he doesn't care, he's just "stressed" and "doesn't want to have to choose" between who to help. He does this every time things get bad, and always bounces back (aka recognizes that I need him too). How do I stay okay with everything while he is having these issues? How can I help him? How can I stop needing reassurance in times like these?
My mom knows. None of what I write describes personal situations, just vague and metaphoric insights.
I've surrounded myself with people who have mental illnesses and broken families. I don't know why, but I find it comforting. If you ever need to talk,I'm around. And I swear I'm not a creepy guy sitting in a basement 0.0
I'm a number 6...   SIXES FOR THE WORLD!
Any other teenagers suffering from anxiety and/or depression?   I feel like I'm the only one outside of my friend group at school, sometimes, which sucks. It'd be nice to know that there are other people my age who have these problems.
I do the same exact thing,hoping it will spark real tears.
Did the antidepressant happen to be lexapro?
I know, I know. It just was a spur of the moment.
I'm a freshman
I had my first kiss/make out session in the back of my mom's car[Tough Love]
Creative Valentine's Day ideas?   Alright, so my boyfriend and I have been together for a while. We're teenagers so we can't really do anything super sexy or romantic on Valentine's day, but we both have a love for the arts. Writing, music, drawing, etc. What are some ideas as to something I could make for him? I was considering writing a super cheesy song for him or something like that.
We all went into the counselor's office today crying. Him, our friends, me. I'm looking more for ways to cheer him up.
I feel like you need to seek help. Not necessarily medication, but definitely some counseling.
