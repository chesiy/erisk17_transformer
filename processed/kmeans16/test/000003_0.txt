Note 4.
I stopped buying brand paper, I like kraft paper with bindings. Unfortunately I wasn't  going to pay shipping for them so I flew to Japan I buy 5.
Cool.

This is what I'm talking about, nice!
Yeah.  it looks  horrific.
There should be a 18 subbreddit for children. This is just cringe material. Or at least make it private.
Korean girls are attrative.
Or if you're a cute japanese girl, "Ohaiiiyyoooo" or maybe a prosti? The things you can suck on for money are endless!
Depends what you like. If you suffer like me financially I'd go with the Note 4. Make scarifies in life for the things in it. E.x I don't eat at all outside, and mostly hang out with friends doing free shit, allowing me to Study Abroad in Japan for a few weeks. On the phones, usually the newer one is nicer, and better.
1) is definitely a nice one. But these are mostly written for stupid people, ergo, "self-help" As they cannot help themselves. But in an other life, You should take time to read A Prayer For Owen Meany, that book will Fuck You Up. Cheers! .
I'm buying one today, I'll add everyone? :)   edit: Oh, this is a female subbreddit, I just searched, "misfit shine" NEVERMIND
Yep. after I saw an AMA here I knew it was all over.  You only need 5 posts though.  Read the Top Posts of all time . "cheers"
social media is a terrible habit if you don't use it as a tool to be productive in life e.x right way to use it: message your friends. See group posts about academics or follow major events that give coupons. e.x of bad way to use it. Be on social media for 5+ hours a day doing stupid shit. If you are the latter, then idk what you can do.  "You can't kill the adiction, only the addict."
You left everything  vauge. I'm just going to reply with a vauge answer. What ever your problem is, isn't the end of the wrold. No problem is. Cancer? Surivable. Frostbite?  Surivable.  Not being able to make friends? **NOT SURIVABLE** as humans we're  social creatures, buy an animal or get a job and hire escorts until you get confidence start meeting people who love you not for you but for who  you are. Best of luck, OP!
