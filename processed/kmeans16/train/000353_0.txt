I have that same keyboard, and I hate it...
It's hard to stress that this is not a normal occurance. I live in Nevada, a pretty leniant state, I also own an AR, but I would NEVER in my life go and waltz into the nearest Wal-Mart with it, because I don't enjoy scaring people. Also, I've never seen anyone carrying more than a handgun because its just stupid.
That took me a second hahahaha
Aw man, this story was fantastic. Really great job on this one!
Holy crap, that soon!?!? just made my week!
Just an average tree...
Japan owns us!
How on earth did they manage that? Thats awesome!
THANK YOU! I love this game to death, but it ends up being really hard to tell my friends that the zombies still glitch through walls, and thats why they died, two and a half YEARS after it was released. At this point most of my friends will give up playing, join me in a few months, die walking up stairs or something like that, and give up again. Some really basic stuff needs to be sorted out.
My only concern is that these new infected are going to be as buggy as the old ones (which is what it seems so far), but far faster and in higher numbers. If the new AI is released with a high number of bugs it could ruin the game, for me at least.

/r/thalassophobia is what you are looking for. It's a subreddit dedicated to your fears. Don't feel bad I have it too...
I just got a chill. The chances that this is a real story hit me at the end...
Nice rifle!
Thank you for making me feel welcome!
No matter what country you come from, we can mostly all agree. EARTH, FUCK YEA!
