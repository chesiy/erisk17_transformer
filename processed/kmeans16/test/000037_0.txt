I know, but they could have released at least a short teaser by now. It doesn't have to be long. A 1-minute teaser trailer would have made me and many other happy. But all I can watch at the moment is the leaked footage, which doesn't look very promising btw. Although I'm sure the full thing in HD will look much better.
I know. I can only blame myself. I'm seeing the movie tomorrow. Then I'll know for sure whether I should have watched all those videos or not.
