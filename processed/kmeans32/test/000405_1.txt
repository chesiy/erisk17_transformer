I've thought of that but it means you still have to play without throwing, right?
are these asexuals female or non-binary?  I mean it doesn't even count because asexuals can also be bad people (especially since we have such small population, any few people is considerably alot)  but really, you are avoiding the question: provide examples in which feminism has helped anyone, including asexuals.
ahh a victim telling others that they have a victim complex
hypocrite, you guys are just basically the same as these feminists attacking an asexual that she deserved to be raped you guys are basically doing the same yourselves and insist that NAFALT, good job proving your statements  http://dontneedfeminism.com/post/78589971327/abbeyxmae-serebrii
really are you going to do this??  http://tryingtomakesenseofpeople.tumblr.com/post/113807401152/okay-what-you-dont-understand-is-that-feminism
she doesn't have to ult to get a kill
Accurate description of the toxicity/arguments of this game

because any other pronoun would be unladylike
yes, escape velocity
thank you, very helpful
but queue times for mid tend to be long, thanks for the advice though haha
how does one practice mid lane?   the reason I am asking this is because it is the most popular lane (we're talking about normals here) and well, if you get it to practice and happen to not do well, you screw up everyone else's experience.  the only good thing is if I don't want it, usually someone else will take it (ranked)
you are just simply sex repulsed. Done.
because I messed up okay
I never said it was acceptable though, you are just assuming (you people please need to stop doing that), but it will still happen. For example rape, rapists will always exist and rape (doesn't mean we shouldn't raise awareness either, but no amount of awareness is going to stop rape, people learning self defence will) or people will do drugs even with awareness, education and being illegal (intervention and therapy sessions will fix these problems).
I think the first step to fixing this problem is to teach people to be logical human beings   children should be taught to (almost) always ask for sources or proof (if it's a personal matter, ask the specific person for personal information based matter)  Also teach children to be kind (do unto other as you would have them do unto you sort of morals). As for me, I just don't care (not in the sense I don't want to hear it, just more along the lines of do what you want-provided it's logical) whether another girl or guy does this or that (or not that I wouldn't support them if it seemed appropriate). I would recommend also that people focus on more important matters than trivial things, like whether this person did this or that (please be logical, if the rumor is someone fed someone else then it doesn't apply here) is not going to fix world hunger. (if you're going to argue what am I doing, myself. well I am studying hydrology because I believe having accessible drinking water is important)  ugh, if you are going to criticize me for celebrity matters, it's for entertainment (entertainment is necessary too, and as i mentioned, I like hearing people's stories, maybe they even inspire me but like okay it's not like there isn't anyone who has a new boyfriend every week other than Taylor Swift)  if I missed anything, be logical  honestly, I feel it comes down to being logical or having common sense. I know not everyone will 'be nice,' but if you're not going to do it, nobody else will.
I met a girl, in a club space. She explicitly told me she was cis (I hate that term by the way) and then a week later turned genderfluid. We don't talk anymore.  transtrenders claim that dysphoria is not necessary; they might change pronouns on a daily basis. Moreover, you can tell they're just doing it for oppression points or whatever.
she asked for advice on reddit 2 months before it happened
I never indicated all transgenders undergo SRS
okay that makes a lot of sense, thanks!
that was part/conclusion of the study. I'm not hiding facts here, she said that being a man while still a woman was hurting her.  and I'm sorry that happened to you. There's no such things as not being dysphoric enough. Just either you are or you are not.
serious question: if gay marriage is legal, why stop there?
or she can just jump to you??
I'm not entirely sure on this, some sources say that the pillar doesn't  how can cait stop a kat ult??
taric (maybe he is viable?), alistar (better in solo lane or jungle) and lulu(better in solo lane),  blitzcrank and soraka are binary or situational picks, for example you wouldn't ALWAYS pick blitz,  thresh (this one is a mix: some will say he's not viable, others will argue he's still relevant; I've just never seen a good one since the last sets of nerfs)  fiddlesticks got nerfed out of viability
veigar is wasted as a support  and did you not read, karma and zilean are not good picks (despite utility) because they lack cc  so that's 15 and then, not every support is viable so it's less than 15
oops
there are simply not enough support champions   simply put: there are not enough champions to fill in the role and it gets tedious trying to rotate among them (I counted 14 using my definition) when there isn't a lot to begin with. you can only play leona so much before you go crazy  the way I define support is: can you stop kat ult? (reliably, such as in the case of morgana, is a different story though) this is what honestly is keeping the support role from being able to fit in other champions. if we just nerfed (preferably delete) katarina then this will be better.  1) traditional supports: -alistar -blitzcrank -braum -janna -leona -lulu -nami -sona -soraka -thresh -taric total: 11  2) mages that went support -annie -fiddlesticks -morgana -vel'koz -zyra total: 5  3) situational supports or those that fail to meet the criteria (usually no hard cc) -lux -kayle -karma -zilean -all other mages
I don't know any satanic music...
not referring to those genres  I mean what I say
Christianity is not a religion (that is it has no 'rules')   there are only 2 commandments as rules (there are other commandments):  **Matthew 22:37-40; Mark 12:30-31; Luke 10:27**  1) Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind 2) Love your neighbor as yourself ______________________________________________  **1 Corinthians 6:12, 10:23** "I have the right to do anything," you say--but not everything is beneficial. "I have the right to do anything"--but not everything is constructive.  **1 Corinthians 6:19** Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own;  **1 Corinthians 10:31; Colossians 3:17** whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.  **1 Timothy 4:4** For everything God created is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving  **Philippians 4:8** whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable--if anything is excellent or praiseworthy--think about such things. _____________________________________________ **Matthew 5:17** Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.  Background: when Jesus came to die on the cross, it is to take up our sin, only because he kept the law at full (thus no sin in him), and bury into the grave and we no longer live in sin but we are free from sin because Jesus resurrected from the dead.  So in everything that we do it is based on discernment and conviction not based on rules. _____________________________________________ note: was with anything, there will be exceptions examples:  1)tattoos: -if you are getting one to spite or rebel against someone that is not a good reason to get one you might hurt yourself (no longer love yourself) -you can honor God by getting a tattoo and with right intentions  2) (secular)music: -songs with positive messages (who says by Selena Gomez, Skyscraper by Demi Lovato), love songs can help you lover yourself or others, your neighbors -songs that have no meaning but can be fun (anaconda by Nicki Minaj) are just meant to be fun with right intentions -satanic music cannot be redeemed by God, avoid these  3) homosexuality -it's the sexual act, not the marriage -it provides no (evolutionary) advantage, it is meaningless, lust and flesh therefore it is not honorable for God -STDs, and general sexual consquences  4) Porn -lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific values, therefore cannot be redeemed for the honor of God  5) Drugs -obvious  etc.  In conclusion, it is not a matter whether it is a sin or not but what your intentions are and discernment (exceptions to those who have clouded judgments and outliers). Sin is transgression of the law (Exodus, Leviticus and Deuteronomy) and you are free from those but it is a matter whether it is beneficial to you, others or God or not. No, you cannot just name something n honor of God and hope to redeem it.  **1 Samuel 16:7b** People look at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart."
