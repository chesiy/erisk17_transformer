Cheers thanks
Look, Reddit has gone to shit these days, and it's because fake mother fuckers like you.  I've been on this 4+ years, and once in awhile there would be a fake pic here and there.  These days, it's everywhere.  Take R/Food for instance.  It's so fake b.c of fuckers like you that it should re named R/Stockphoto.    And get off your fucking soapbox regarding what Reddit should be.  I'm not about to get lectured from some fuckwit.
Our window for "successful" is extremely small, maybe 2-3 years tops.  And as much as everyone has been praising our Defense, we lost McDonald and possibly Justin Smith.  That's 2 seasoned veterans gone right there.    I'm optimistic, but very very cautious as to this year's draft.  The 2012 draft that Balke whiffed on can bite us in the ass down the road as well
I love food, and everything about it, and I'm also a purist, which some could label as snobby.  But if I see a post that is inaccurate, or a stock photo, or people using words for click bait, I'll try and educate without being a dick.  Maybe it's b.c of my Japanese upbringing, who knows.    But I assure you that this sub a few years ago had awesome content, all of it being genuine.  And I felt as though today was finally the day to bring this up as a conversation piece
There's times the 49ers resemble a college team based on their formations and shifting.  It's really predictable at times
I know this is totally fantasy land thinking, but if Lebron wants the most rings, GS should be close to the top of the list.  He can play point, allowing Steph to be 2 guard, or play the 4 and let Bogut be the middle.    I can't see too many other teams that could compete with that line up.  It def is a better upgrade than the current Miami squad.

Sorry fellas, won't be able to do a meet up tonite.  But now that I know there's a few NYC folks here, let's do Finnerty's soon!

This is cultural, and perhaps even a difference in physiology.  Being Japanese, it's been in our society for hundreds of years.  Bodies respond differently.  I hear what you're saying, but I didn't even flinch for a second when this was offered.  Perhaps this [article](http://www.facingtherisingsun.com/japan-travel-tips-eating/raw-chicken-sashimi-torisashi-toriwasa) might shed light on this matter.

And, to get to the Superbowl, there's a high probability that we have to play the Giants, and it could be in NY.  I hope the Giants don't become our arch enemy like the Cowbows were in the 80's.  Those were painful Championship games
Unknown entity?  Our coaching staff watches and scrutinizes these 2 players everyday for the past 2 years, they know the exact weakness and strengths of both.  Now while Kaep might not have the stats all Alex lovers love to spew, he's opening up the playbook Harbs designed to have.    I got 5 on it saying we'll see a bomb to Moss in the next few weeks, and we'll see different plays we haven't seen all season because we've had to cater to Alex so much.
Whether it's Kaep or Smith who is at the helm   Whoever is under center from here on out, we support Harbs fully.  This past week there's been tons of shit talking between which QB is better.  I'm guilty of this as well.    However if we lose in the playoffs, the last thing I want to see on this message board is another QB debate, or fans questioning Harbs choice.  We ride n die as a team, no throwing anyone under the bus.  It's not about, "Alex wouldn't have made that mistake, or Kaep was too young"  I'm done with this rant, let's go Niners.
So you know, sushi rice and onigiri are 2 different types of rice.
What's remarkable about him, is how passionate he takes his job.  Not saying that making sushi is mundane, but after doing it for over 50 years, he still takes his trade so seriously.  I think it's safe to say most of us get tired/bored of our jobs after awhile, especially if it's not challenging, or the pay is low.  This man gives his life to it.  Props
Here come the Monday morning quarterback comments.  Look, you can sit here and analyze the video and say "the academy teaches you this and that," but at the end the officer put himself in the line of fire.   Im not siding with the cops, but it's real easy from our vantage point to criticize the way it was handled, incompetent or not.  Most cops never have use their firearm in their lifetime, esp nypd.
You didn't answer the 2nd question.  If the higher ups failed to take any action, and Ramos was still out there doing his thing, what would you do?  How far do you go to see him get reprimanded?  Do you risk your own job?     It's hypothetical, but let's be real.  There's a general code amongst the blue boys.  My point is, there's Ramos everywhere doing illegal shit 24-7.  How much of it is tolerated is a question unanswered, but from an outsider, I wonder who would stand up and intervene.
that article is about a dude enjoying the fact that he can play pick up games nearly anywhere in the city.  clearly since you're hating on that, it's evident you prob have never touched a rock before.  quit hatin
Good question.  When I have people over, I use a burner stove so that I can cook on the table, but you can also do it over stove top.  Not a rolling boil, but a good simmer.  The key is getting the beef cut super thin (paper thin 1/16").   You basically want to dip the meat and swirl in the water for a few seconds max.  Veggies will take longer.
Japanese style foundue minus the cheese.  Thin sliced meats and veggies get cooked quickly in a broth, and dip with sauces.
man grab a pen n paper, start jotting them down.  back in HS my friend's go into it, they sucked at first but they kept at it.  now some of em can go on spittin forever.  you have the vocab and cleverness
Go to La Quinta Hotel on W 32nd st in K-Town.  Take the elevator to the top, you get an amazing view of the Empire Building plus great Korean food after you get blitzed.  Plus it's not a stuffy area like midtown/meatpacking.
This might not be the best advice, but at one point or another he's gonna have to swing.  Whether or not he wins, isn't the issue, because he'll always look back and know he stood up to something.  Chances are after that encounter, his bully will leave him alone.  And years from now, you guys can all laugh at this
Recipe please
You're in luck pal, I work for the National Hemophilia Foundation in NYC.  I just happened to be browsing Reddit when I came across your post.

How many of you are overqualified for your job?   I'm always curious of the person next to me, if they know what the fuck they're doing.  I'm a program manager for a national non profit, which I've been doing for the past 15 years.  Quite frankly, I can do my job with my eyes closed.  Am I content?  No, but I'm striving to do better.  How bout you guys?
Mixed messages   A few weeks ago I met someone amazing (the white rhino), you know the kind where you can't stop thinking of them, that rare beauty you run into once every few years.   We've hung out a few times, nothing serious, but I've been getting the good vibe overall.  She even informed me things weren't going well with her bf, and sounded as though things were going to end. (I didnt even ask her) Last time she even said, "I probably won't be talking to him"  So last nite I finally summoned up the courage to ask her out. Although it didn't come out the smoothest, I still put it out there.  She responded, "I'm still with him..trying to work things out."  I asked how that was going, and all she said was "it's going"...Of course I tried to play it cool, and told her to let me know if anything changes.   My question fellow Redditors.  I can handle the rejection, but was I missing some huge sign that I wasn't aware of.  Was this a flat out no, or do I still have a shot in the long term?
