My feeling is that it's a kind of hypercorrection. Like, teachers tell you not to say "me and him," but instead "he and I," so some people have a tendency to say "he and I" even when it's wrong.  In American English we tend to soften words with T's in them: butter become budder, metal becomes medal. So some people are hypercorrecting all T words to into D words even though that's not how Americans typically pronounce those words.  I've heard it in the New York metro area. I don't know if this is a country-wide thing.
Thanks.
When you're watching your weight, thinking any food is "the devil" tends to be counterproductive because it makes it even more tempting.   But she is right that soda is bad for you just like any other high-sugar, low-nutrition food is. It not only contributes to weight gain but tooth decay when consumed excessively or as part of a general poor-quality diet.
Just read it instead of pre-judging based on what you think you know about 14-year-old girls who are trying to avoid getting murdered by Nazis.
I think we're going to have to get our hands on it before we can comment. From the picture I can't see how it could possibly be a softcover, but most likely the picture is misleading. From a different angle the cover will probably look thinner and softer.
Try /r/literature then.
Not really correct. There were some well-known rich Jewish families and there were certainly some well-off Jewish communities, but overall, the majority of Jews throughout history were poor.   This kind of conspiracy theory that OP is talking about really only goes back to the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, which was first published in 1903. Previous to that, the sort of conspiracy theories about Jews was that they were poisoning wells and using the blood of Christian children in their matzah, not that they were taking over the world.
The "things that don't need to be kosher for Pesach in the first place" is my favorite part. (Page 102)
Yes, you're right I ignored some parts of your post and I don't find your saying so abrasive, it's just that I'm caught up with this same thing with someone who's in the place of your coworker and it's so hard to have to basically just stand around and watch them suffer because of a bad decision they made 20 years ago and have been compounding ever since.
Have you ever been sexually assaulted? Honest question, not being a twat here.  I've been bullied and my biggest "win" came through words. And it took me a long time to get there because for too much of my life I was also given the advice to just ignore bullies.   People sometimes think they will react in a certain way, and when the time comes, it somehow isn't how it goes.  This isn't a case of being cornered in a dark alley and feeling panicked. The girl had enough presence of mind to speak up the first time, she just needs the lesson reinforced that just because an authority figure says something doesn't mean they're always right and doesn't mean you have to listen.
I don't know where you live but I literally went card shopping three hours ago and hardly any of them have ribbons or bows.   And if some of them do, it's just a style fad. The way some cards have audio cards inside and play a song or a sound when you open them. Or the way some of them pop up. Or the way some of the are like three feet tall. It doesn't have any particular significance.
One for example I found by looking at the "What's New" feed at Internet Archive - they add a few thousand new books a day, all very old and very obscure. One day I just decided to read one. No had ever reviewed it on Amazon, Goodreads or anywhere else on Google search. I was the first person in the age of the Internet to post anything about it. The last review of the book was from 1912 when it was published.   What book was it?
This is so true. On a recent ELI5 a completely wrong answer got like 10 upvotes because nobody around here has heard the real truth about it.  And the Reddit circle jerk loves certain "facts" that have been debunked or at least severely criticized, such as polyphasic sleep. They keep repeating information about it like it's a solid fact and it ain't.  ETA: Downvotes! Thank you all for proving my point.
This article confirms that the picture is real but claims it's a year old and conditions aren't like that anymore.  http://www.diariolibre.com/noticias/2014/11/29/i905221_salud-pblica-confirma-foto-nios-amontonados-maternidad-altagracia.html (Spanish)
If you like odd mysteries, I'd like to recommend Claire DeWitt and the City of the Dead by Sara Gran   It's not a perfect book. The mystery is actually the weakest part of it and the main character, Claire DeWitt, can be a little off-putting, but the whole thing is so unusual, mystical, thought-provoking, richly evocative of post-Katrina New Orleans and even occasionally laugh-out-loud funny, that I thought I'd give it a rec.  It's vaguely reminiscent of The Boy Detective Fails by Joe Meno, so I'm going to give that a mention too.  http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9231999-claire-dewitt-and-the-city-of-the-dead  http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/102504.The_Boy_Detective_Fails
Have you read two unrelated books around the same time that had something surprising in common?   Maybe the question doesn't really make sense, but I couldn't figure out how to phrase it better. Lately I feel like I've been reading two books around the same time that have nothing to do with each other but funnily have similar aspects or elements.  For example, Friday I read Where'd You Go, Bernadette by Maria Semple, which is a modern-day domestic dramady set in Seattle, and Saturday I finished The Abominable by Dan Simmons, which is a historical drama/thriller largely set in England and Mount Everest. But both books have a connection to Antarctica.   I didn't read these two books together on purpose, in fact I didn't know that Antarctica figured into Where'd You Go, Bernadette -- I took it out from the library without even reading the book jacket.   Has this happened to you?
