Microsoft, Kyocera settle patent suit over Android phones
Does anyone think this may be a result of people (strangely) buying 7 so they can get the upgrade? Maybe they can find cheaper versions of 7 somewhere.  Bingo! http://tech.slashdot.org/story/15/07/01/1251202/people-are-obtaining-windows-7-licenses-for-the-free-windows-10-upgrade

Sad. On the other hand, what is it with these titles with a sentence then a comma and then one word  dunno, that's simply the title supplied to me when I clicked "submit" :)
As long as you can deal with that one pesky little problem. How do you prevent nano scale anything from being carcinogenic itself?   carcinogenic? Why? The immune system you mean? Surely that's a trivial problem to overcome ?
The aunt and grandmother of a seven-year-old girl who died of a brain injury have been jailed for what a judge described as just about the worst case of child cruelty it is possible to imagine.
What is that smell?
It's perfect, you get to play with the dog without having to deal with the downsides of owning a dog, like not owning furniture.   nearly :) The dope dumps in my garden when he visits because the local cats literally scare the s**t out of him ! :)

Hi Ralph
Brand new PSU intermittently rebooting/shutting-down   Edit: replacement PSU works fine (4 days uptime so far)  Win 7 64 Pro, Gigabyte  GA-EP43T-UD3L mobo, Corsair  CX750M modular PSU. 3 X SATA drives (1 is SSD), 1 SATA DVD burner. SIW/BIOS/SpeedFan shows the +12V line is outputting only 0.83-2.5V http://i.imgur.com/BSbIh6Y.png. Temperatures normal, all sockets reseated/checked.
I'm flattered :)
I feel exactly the same, the lags on my 2012 Nexus 7 with Lollipop is terrible. If I factory-reset to kitkat is there any way of blocking the final update to lollipop?  Because even the notification that lollipop was ready to install seemed to cause my tablet to lag  edit: just got 5.1 OTA   my tablet is MUCH more responsive!
Google Announces Android 5.1 with Device Protection, HD Voice
Windows 10 is free for everyone as far as I know.  wrong, the technical preview is free to all, but the final release is a free UPGRADE from Win 7/8, otherwise it's retail/OEM/pre-installed on a new machine, as always  [Today was a monumental day for us on the Windows team because we shared our desire to redefine the relationship we have with you  our customers. We announced that a free upgrade for Windows 10 will be made available to customers running Windows 7, Windows 8.1, and Windows Phone 8.1 who upgrade in the first year after launch.*](http://blogs.windows.com/bloggingwindows/2015/01/21/the-next-generation-of-windows-windows-10/)
You're actually alright.  thank you, contrary to Ransal's belief, we mods (in the main) just give up our time to help improve reddit in our own little way. These little dramas aren't even worthy of attention generally   Maybe the janitor.  Capital J please :) I used to like to think so, now it's just a nickname/joke that has stuck   http://i.imgur.com/lJmWQgW.png
Maybe jumped the ban trigger too quickly but  not so, you're unaware of the back-story, the users' previous modmails in /wtf, /creepy   /gifs etc, this was in NO way jumping the gun. In fact (sigh, I generally don't even respond to these pathetic witch-hunts, but here we go), when he first disputed a post removal in /creepy (a post that was NOT removed), he sent me a PM, even though I had nothing to do with the issue at that point,   I looked into it   politely tried to help him out:  http://i.imgur.com/x0n8CiB.png  didn't work. Notice his insistence that I am actually a dummy account for admin, oh I wish :) And his refusal to believe his post in /creepy was NOT removed, despite multiple mods/screenshots being provided as proof. His paranoia   accusations that mods are liars, in a conspiracy to silence him   so on followed him from that point. I would never have even been involved in any of this if HE had not contacted ME
