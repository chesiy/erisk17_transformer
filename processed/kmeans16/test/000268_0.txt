Holy shit--that was amazing.  HAHA!

It's just the track-record of his shows.  My original post was meant to be sort of tongue-in-cheek.  I like that article though.
Former Papa John's driver here.  I knocked on an apartment door, and when it opened, the smell of weed wafted out.  Some skanky-looking blonde says, "Hey--come on in."  "Uhhhh....," I replied, "...okay...".  They had porn playing on the TV, and not only were the visuals distracting, but the incessant moaning of the woman on the screen.  They said to set the pizza down on the coffee table.  I went to do so, and realized that I had to miss the lines of cocaine they had ready to go.  She hands a wallet to a guy sitting there, and he hands me cash.  With a wink he said, "A little something extra for being such a nice guy."  I walked back to my car shaking my head, and expecting a nice tip.  After taking out the price of the pizza, it was a whopping $3.05 tip.  I should've called the cops on the cheap bastards.  HAHA!
ALWAYS start with the Thrawn trilogy (Heir to the Empire, Dark Force Rising and The Last Command).  If you do, you'll want to read them all.  Stay away from "The Crystal Star".  It was bizarre and pointless.
What's even worse, is that if you look at the actual painting, it's not as if you can see nipples or labia or anything.  The closest they get is half a butt-crack.
It's the same where I live (in Baton Rouge, Louisiana). You aren't alone.  And I hate it when after making a generalized statement, people immediately come back and say "not all of them are....".  Yeah--no crap, there isn't a single thing in the world that is 100% the same across the board.  /u/promisejustcurious is simply stating that in the are where they work, black people seem to be disrespectful of people's time, money, and service.
Agreed.  I've been working part- or full-time since I was 15yo.  I had to so I could pay for my phone and car insurance.  Then it moved to helping pay for rent/bills when my parents divorced, and my mom didn't have a GREAT job.  I had to grow up quickly.
This sounds like me and my wife.  We're doing MyFitnessPal and FitBit combos.  Dieting is hard.  We caved today, and got bundlets from Nothing Bundt Cake.  *#drool*
Wow... that was pretty bad.  Hopefully, it's just chalked up to live conditions and not the fact that they're just frickin' too old to do this now.  Jeez!
Yep, same here.  And she isn't as attractive as I remember her bring.  Now, she comes off as just being needy and whiney.
TIL: That it's my 1st cakeday, and I thought I'd missed it.   I've been looking forward to my cakeday ever since I learned what a cakeday was. I joined Reddit after I got sick of 4chan. I was getting to old for 4chan's shit... just like m00t apparently has.  I've enjoyed my first year here at Reddit. I learn about events before most other people. I see cool Internet things before they become mainstream. Etc.  Thanks, fellow Redditors, and I look forward to year 2!
Go back to 4chan.
Yep.  That's exactly my point!
I know this gets posted from time to time, but it needs to be posted and seen/heard again. 74 years later, and it's still poignant!
