Kind of. Loved this dude to no end, then we broke up. And he straight up told me he doesn't like me as more than a friend anymore after about a year of us still having feelings after we broke up. Now he's talking to me less and less and obviously trying to get away from me and it breaks my heart because I can feel him slipping away and I can't handle that. As melodramatic as it sounds I've been flirting a lot with other guys lately, because I figure that if I give myself to guys that don't matter then I'll forget the only one that does. My friends hate him, his friends hate me. We fought a lot and at one point this summer he was being such a dick to me that I told him I was done and I wasn't gonna talk to him anymore. That lasted about a week. Then I smoked weed once in like, September after I promised him I wouldn't (he's really against drugs and alcohol), and then texted him high off my ass. Basically after a spell of us being really good with each other, I broke it and he said "I broke the best bond we've ever had with each other." Then he ran off and his friends found him at the smoke shop because "if she's gonna stoop that low then so am I." And nothing has been the same since then. I love this guy to no end, he's the only thing I ever think about, and he's pushing me away, and I think about it and it just makes my entire body hurt because I know it's completely over and won't happen again. Sorry for the wall of text, but I started typing and it felt good to let it out.
"You'll find more and more peace with Dad, and you won't always cry every night about it. It will get easier. About 2 years from now you'll accidentally come across a boy who breaks your heart over and over again and you still care about him. He cycle started because you were the first to let him go. Don't do that. It will be tough, but stick with him because he's worth it. Stay motivated in school, because in 3 years you'll be in your AP classes regretting the times you could barely pass 8th grade math because you were lazy. Just look to the future and keep your goals in mind. Tell Mom you love her. Hang in there. It gets easier."  (I may or may not have gotten teary eyed writing that)
That's weird because the same exact thing happened to me a couple weeks ago. I feel you. It's sad.
For some context: four years ago my friend's older sister died from cancer. All three of us are into marching band. Then the other day he was driving me home and said "Ya know, when I see you I don't even miss my sister. I don't need to go visit her or think about her because it's like she's right next to me again. You're both so dedicated to what you do, and you both make an effort to be kind to everybody." And I cried
You regularly get your eyebrows done. Cuz they're on fleek.
University of Michigan or UCLA, then med school at Harvard (but that won't happen)
Okay! Thank you so much, I appreciate it!
annamarie225 15/f  It's 2 am and I don't have anyone to talk to. I do marching band and frc and I like books and sleeping and animals. So. Please.
That's really cute actually aw
Oh my god. I don't even know. It's a long story and he's really difficult to read but idk. He's frustrating and I have no clue where I am with him.
My friend wrote a really in-depth and long thing in my yearbook. It was super sweet, and at the end it was "If I were a guy, I'd date you" with a bunch of wink faces and idk that made me laugh. The whole thing just made me stupidly happy tbh
Ay
Marching band and this program that's basically like "upperclassmen get assigned a few freshman to make sure they don't majorly fuck up throughout the year". But it's okay because I came home and found Oreos in the pantry.
My eyes are really cool, they're mostly light green with a tiny bit of brown in the middle and a tiny bit of blue on the outside. But my favorite eye color on other people is dark green or brown. I looove big brown eyes.
I thought so too XD And it's dejaentenduude.tumblr.com

- I don't care about how big your penis is, please don't mention it anymore because it's creepy  - I wish you could just be open with me and tell me if you don't like me because it's emotionally exhausting trying to read you  - I feel like you're replacing me after we've been best friends for the last 5 years   For three different people.
I already have my heart set on Michigan Tech.  I think I have a pretty good chance if getting in, considering my decent GPA (3.67), and the fact that I'm in my school's robotics program and am going to an engineering camp there this summer.
July 3rd. Overshadowed by fireworks and hot dogs every year. Sigh.
The Promise - Reel Big Fish. One of my favorite covers of anything ever. It's right up with Iron and Wine's cover of Such Great Heights.
Ohh yeah, it was pretty bad. Me and a few other people on the team said it was because the wrong team was losing. But ah well, we ended up winning anyway, even though that was a pretty infuriating rematch, lol. By the way, we love 573 :3 3
Try Watsky. My favorite from him is Wounded Healer. Too lazy to get a link

Waterford resident
Band: Waterford Kettering Marching Captains  Instrument: Euphonium  Show Name: Music Royale  Repertoire: Bicycle Race by Queen, Hit the Road Jack by Ray Charles, King Kong by Jimmy Castor, Hall of the Mountain King  Unfortunately, as you can probably tell, we don't compete and we're a show band. We just go to invitationals, festivals, and play at parades and football games. We are a very good band though. Straight 1's at festival for the past three years, we got first place from 150 bands at the Mackinaw City memorial day parade, and we're going to be in the Detroit Thanksgiving Day Parade on national television. Last time we went there we got first. I wish we competed though tbh.
Yup, that's it! Thank you!
I absolutely love McCrae and have a giant obsession/crush on him tbh. I actually got really jealous about he and Amanda and I realized I needed to take a step back and reevaluate the fact that I'm getting jealous about a man I will never meet and has no idea who I am. Oh my god.
Oh my gosh. Will do tomorrow when I get home.
Heh. I get it. I'm gonna message you now. Yeah.
This freaking song. Definitely my favorite on the album, kind of hard to listen to right now though because I just went through a rough breakup and he and I used to listen to this song together all the time.
