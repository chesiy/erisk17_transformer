After hearing all of this I have no reason not to beleve you :)
From a app called yo shirt! It's expesive I'm not going to lie but it's really cool because you can turn ANY picture into a screen print shirt, theirs no desktop site and it's only on iPhone (so if you don't have an iPhone your out of luck sorry) [heres a shirt I made with some cool album art](http://m.imgur.com/nxBv0kA)
I love the hard dance sceen and I want to see it grow! It's no problem :) here are some lables!

Hey guys! I don't know how AMA's are organized on here but I do have afew sugestions: Headhunterz, he made the switch from hardstyle to house a bit ago so I think people would have some questions for him. Angerfist, he had his own festival last year and he released a pretty kick ass album to go along with it. Noisecontrollers, one of the biggest names in the hardstyle scene, he has an album coming out soon and I think it would be cool to ask him afew questions
It had a lot of things that turn me off anime *cough cough* INSEST *cough cough*... But seriously one of the main things I didn't like was the tone it was just inconsistent, it goes from goofy cat girl bullshit to horrible multination with no middle ground. The part that killed it for me was was the fight scene between Lucy and that other girl they both looked ridiculous which made it even more stupid when she says "my vector has a better range then yours" which I guess sums it up right their. TO MANY FUCKING CLICHS lets see: goofy sex stuff where another character walks in on them *check* Incest *check* taking a girl home with you who you just found at the beach with no clothing on instead of taking her to the hospital *check* building up a harem *check* having one of those scenes where two characters are comparing their powers in the middle of a fight *check* naked underage girls *check*  just too many clichs  presented with a completely straight face which makes the violence hard to take seriously (it is pretty raw I will say that though) also this is kind of a minor gripe but fucking cat girls with invisible hands coming out of their backs that are basically high frequency blades...... I mean really. It's late here.... So ya fuck you elfen lied
Niiiiiiicccce, good mastering on this, I have afew criticisms (if you are the guy who made this) the reverse bass sounds like it could be a little more distorted and while I understand what you are trying to do with the vocals they sound a little boring, maybe you could get a girl friend to do the vocals and give it that aggressive human element. Besides the two things that I mentioned everything else is their, good job on this one :)
I made a very dreamy, plucky, trancy lead with Toxic Biohazard (check des. for patch and FLP)   [heres the patch](https://www.dropbox.com/s/06qhr8ecvzixmp9/dreamy%20pluck.fst?dl=0) [heres the FLP](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fgqsiw0eju5zhi2/pluck%20test.flp?dl=0) and finally [heres how it sounds](https://soundcloud.com/infernal-imp/pluck-test), enjoy and be sure to link me any songs you've made with it (you don't need to credit me I'm just interested to see what you come up with)
and then above Gav and Micheal is Jon Tron just eching it up all day and a running gag could be they think he's a chain smoker because all they hear coming from the apartment is ECH! ^^^ECH! ILL GET MY SWOOORRDDD DANNY!!!
Believe it or not he actually has a hardstyle alias, sadly he's only [released one song under it](http://youtu.be/0wXZJues_bs)
Sure thing dude, I don't know of any but I'll take a look for you. Also *gives pat on back*
Not all hard trance is like this but most of the stuff I listen to is, some recommendations I have are Lisa lashes, Kidd Kaos, Alex Kidd, dark by design, ASYS, geck-o and the organ donors. P.S. Listen to [this](http://youtu.be/erZJu-x41hQ) it's what got me into hard trance :)
Sure thing :)
Good: Ophidian, The Outside Agency, Nosferatu, Art of fighters, Digital punk, Massive New Krew, Radical Redemption, Meander, The Prophet, Yandere Complex and The Dark Oscillators   Bad: Body Lotion (srsly wtf), You, Psycho 909, Tone, The Wild Motherfuckerz and The Donkey Rollers
[Japanese stream hardcore 4 album preview](http://youtu.be/IZRvaeJUKjw) my favorite song from this album is clock control by Kobaryo, the melody is spot on   [Massive Circlez 2 cross fade demo](http://youtu.be/IZRvaeJUKjw) all the Massive Circlez compilations are gold, most Japanese producers make all kinds of hard dance but the massive new krew consistantaly make Hardstyle so check them out  As for buying these... Well most Japanese releases I've seen are physical copy only and they are only available from various Japanese websites (so unless you speak Japanese or your browser translates it for you, you might have a hard time finding out if the CD's are still in stock / if they ship outside of Japan). the Japanese stream hardcore comps. Are on iTunes as for the Massive Circlez you might have to result to torrenting. I can PM you the torrent file if need be
One of Shingo's older songs, the kick isn't great and with youtube being what it was back in 09 the quality is a little rough. Look past that however and you will be hooked! P.S. If your into speedcore check out Shingo's other alias Round Wave Crusher (RWC)
Thanks man!
