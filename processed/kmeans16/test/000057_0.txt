Well, I guess it is time. Hello gray friend!
Thank you very much for your input. I am just beginning my project so I am just trying to collect some raw data at this point. Later on down the road would you and some of your classmates be willing to fill out a questionnaire at some point? It probably wouldn't be for awhile.  I think the key for both fields to work together is to find common ground and to learn more about the other field. I think too often naturopaths are labeled as not using evidence and allopaths are labeled as pill pushers too busy for their patients. Common ground is easy, we both want what is best for patients. As for the later, what is a good resource for learning about evidence of naturopathy? I have read a little bit on UpToDate and we did have a lecture about natural remedies in my pharmacology class.     *Edit*: Do you know of other good forums/resources where I could talk with other naturopaths and patients?

Hahahaha, this happened to me! Also I had a hot ultra sound nurse examine me... That was awkward.

Reddit has changed. The top comment of an article was almost always the counter argument to the link. This would allow the reader to get a full perspective on the topic. Now it is usually occupied with circle jerking reinforcement (i.e, all the anti-Muslim posts over the last 36 hours).  I am not taking either side on this issue, I am just disappointed I had to scroll this far down for a counter argument.  Inb4 "le noob month old reddit account talks about the good ol days hue hue hue", I deleted my old account because it had an offensive connotation.

Did they run that double move for this throw?
Honestly if you told me before hand the game was going to be this close I would have been ok with it. Obviously I wanted a win, screw off everyone who wanted the vikes to lose. You aren't true Viking fans. Teddy made some rookie mistakes, but wasn't awful. Running game never found rhythm. Defense looked great until they ran out of steam.   It was a fun game to watch, Skol Vikings.
Samesies with you guys. Bears are my least favorite, because Cutler.

No stream access, what was the play and rule that ruled it a safety?
Subtle. I like it.
