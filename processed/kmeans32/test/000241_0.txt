Other than magazines and newspapers?
Congrats, this is the only post today to make me laugh. :)
Be careful, bricked phones are a real thing, and the likelihood of it happening varies greatly from device to device. Do more than read forums where you find your phone. Create accounts and ask questions, pick brains, see what kind of issues others have come across. XDA is usually my first stop for Android questions.
Excellent! Thank you so much!
lol That was yours? To be fair, it was one of the first ones I listened to, stumbled on it just as I was getting into Secret World. If I remember right, I was in and out of it between SWC episodes, so I probably didn't jump in and binge listen like I usually do. It's on my short list of pods to listen to again. I do that when I can't remember many details. I'll be sure to shoot you an update of a better informed opinion. It had a fight on a bridge and later on in their HQ, right? And something about betrayal within the ranks?
So, what are they supposed to put on their cereal?
/r/atheism   They are every bit as nutty as the bible-thumpers.  edit: Thinking back on it, nutty is the wrong word. I should have said they are as quick to attack others who don't believe as they do as the bible-thumpers. God, tons of that crap was just plain vicious.
Can confirm? Why, because her legs are missing? You, sir, must be an expert in your field.
Fun facts about dinosaurs.
I'm looking at my Titanium Backup Pro backups now, and see the following...   Accounts   Application Widgets   Bluetooth Pairings   Call Log   Country, Language, Time zone   Messages (SMS   MMS)   Wallpaper   Wi-Fi Access Points    With a custom recovery (which I'm assuming you have installed) you can do a nandroid backup, which includes absolutely everything. I remember some time ago (I haven't needed to fiddle around with flashing for quite some time) that there was an app or something that pulled data out of your nandroid so you could just restore what you wanted out of it, though I don't recall the name. It's on XDA somewhere (which really should be your first stop on all things Android.) TB also will pull apps + data from nandroids, but I'm not sure about other info.  As far as a backup that you don't need root to backup and restore app data (and possibly other things, you'll have to research it) as well as just the apps, Helium can do that.  I am, however, at least a year out of the loop. I used to wipe and flash my phones almost daily just playing around, but between TB, Helium, and my nandroids, I had most everything covered.  edited: more stuff
Mine was downvoted into oblivion. I learned right off the bat that the reddiquette is a pipe dream, and that valid comments with merit which don't follow the popular mindset are utterly skullfucked to death. So I simply stopped commenting or even reading opinion pieces, and stick to questions asking for help with stuff (Android as an example) or interesting news and other junk like that. I just have different options than too many redditors, and how they handle honest debate is a too disheartening to be a part off.
Aw, I had high hopes when I saw the name, but ended up skimming to the end.    3/10, good trolling effort, poor result, will not look for more of him.
He's talking about the light, not the object emanating the light.    My vote goes to it being real to the characters, there were several other ways he could have used to convey the awesomeness of the object, and I don't recall any other effects that wouldn't be real in-movie.
Sigh.
Would converting with Handbrake solve that?
Oh, that's what the problem is, I'm an idiot. See, I just didn't realize. Thank you for pointing that out.
Pretty obvious you haven't got much experience with the real drug world. Innocents suffer every day due to the whole mess. Not everyone gets a choice whether or not they associate with them, and often times are completely unaware they are. My sister's best friend in school was killed because her father was in it. She had no idea about anything.   And war, as horrible as I believe it to be, is the natural state of affairs. Has there ever been a time in history when it wasn't? Are they all necessary? No. The Iraq war wasn't, I think. But when groups like ISIS or the Nazis rise up, evil will only triumph when good men do nothing. Did more people die in WWII than would have died had Hitler had gone unchecked?   But all that stuff aside, I still would prefer a children's toy store didn't sell drug dealer toys.
BTW, I just installed JuiceDefender and there is an option in the ultimate app that lets you  control data access for any app individually. It's been so long since I've used it that I've forgotten the option was there.
They only kinda worked for me. What really straightened me out for a good while was a switch. I shot all our storm windows with a bb gun. He went to the plum tree, got a branch, had me hold the back of a chair, and gave me 3 licks. Oh dear lord the pain. I was good for months after that.
I used them both, and prefered PocketCasts. But I could only download so many episodes. Since I also wanted to use my pod player for Podiobooks books (which can have tons of chapters) I use Podkicker now.   Really, they are all very similar.
Well, when I go to /r/Android in my normal Chrome, there's a big list of links in the right-side bar. How will it show that bar?
My X2 has a HDMI port, so when I wasn't using it it sat next to the TV and streamed video (damn you, Hulu!) and my Ascend was given to my 8 yr. old daughter with GrooVe IP so she has her own phone as long as she's within WiFi.
Dude, nothing else worked. You got it right, thanks a million!
lol
I am a beautiful person. (Just installed it the other day, so it's basically the default.)  And I turn that option off, I'd rather hit the words at the top than have it auto-correcting what it wants me to say.
I actually thought about doing something like that, but my tastes definitely go against the grain.  I can tell you GO Launcher is pretty much the king of GB, but quite a few folks love ADWLauncher EX, Launcher Pro, and Zeam, and Nova and Apex launchers rule ICS. The bulk of the rest of them are pretty much the same, with different options within each that tailor to different peoples needs. In launchers, I put a little list at the top of launchers that are really different from the rest.  With browsers, there are a lot of good ones. Opera is probably the favorite, with lots of Dolphin users. Chrome is really popular on ICS.  As far as app stores go, Play Market is the only one, outside of providers' own apps, that won't break your TOS. Amazon has a lot of followers, mostly due to the free app of the day. GetJar was getting really popular until they dropped their free Gold apps. SlideME and soc.io mall have a few followers, too.
Those are all neat launchers. Another one I really liked was Rocket Launcher, but mostly because it seemed to confuse most folks. :) SPB Shell was a *really* nice launcher for showing off my phone. The idle screen is unparalleled.
Meh, no. If the ads look like Resident Evil to me, I'm pretty turned off. I'm sure it's "not the same game at all", but it's rare that a FPS game can grab me. Or worse yet, a third person view when you simply shift from target to target with an auto-aim. They all really get monotonous.  I'm pretty hooked on the MMORPGs. I've tried tons of them, paid and free (and there ARE a ton of them.) Dealing with people makes for a much richer experience to me. (For whatever reason, the biggest one, WoW, bores the hell out of me though.)

Cool peanut butter use: The next time you have chili, take a slice of bread, coat the top with peanut butter, fold it in half, dip it in the chili, and be utterly amazed at how good such an odd combination of foods tastes.
