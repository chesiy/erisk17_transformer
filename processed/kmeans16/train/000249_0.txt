Good pickup
Well fuck Man...
OP can suck a fat one.  Lady looked embarrassed as fuck.  People dress up in costumes and shit all the time. She admitted to why she was wearing it.  Leave her the fuck alone. You can buy fatigues online.  Then your ass posted it for some of the extra imaginary loving online. Tsk Tsk. She wants to wear her sons shit..  Let her.  For Christ's sake.  We have men marrying men and men becoming women and you think the Internet gives a fuck about this?   Source: Family of semper fi and they all are dicks.
"I'd play Mclemore at the 3"  Yea..  Let's not. I say this time and time again. Kings have one of the worst development staffs in the league. Everyone always asks "why you trade X, look at him now". Truth is,  until we change things we can't create those players.  Whiteside would not have panned out here just like Lin didn't in Goldenstate.  Stauskas may be Jimmer... May be Ray Allen.  Idk but personally,  he has something in common with Jimmer and that was he was apart of a team that wasn't meant for him. Good luck.   People need to stop trashing the trade. Kings need endorsements for the new arena and they need to sell tickets.  I renewed but I know a few people who didn't after last season. This was a revitalized trade which has given us real hope and I haven't had that in years. (I'm delusional...  I believe we will win the championship every year.)  Personally, I don't feel we need these posts here but you are always allowed to post. Understand that the general consensus of the City,  not just fans,  liked the trade.
In all fairness...  Kings got more shit than Ellen Pao this off season. Once the Woj bomb hit,  you guys ran with it and either attacked or downvotes anything kings said and wrote our FO off as dumb. Making dumbass claims of trades for Cousins, it was a nightmare. The trade hit and you guys went nuts.  Saying how shitty we are and how fucked we our.  "trade Cousins,  he deserves better" comments were plenty. Rejections from  people we made attempts for only sweetened the insults. In comes Bellinelli and Rondo. Top it off with some Koufos and maybe some Jsmoove and all of a sudden I only see comments about "Wow gonna be a decent/interesting team" or "can't wait to watch that."    "If you're lucky enough to not get down voted to hell within 5 minutes,  you might last long enough to be insulted mercilessly." - /r/nba
Fuck everything. Slutty girls,  hot girls,  fat girls,  turtles,  dogs,  a fish,  pie, glory hole, neighbor, Steven the butcher, Molly the prostitute, a peanut butter sandwich.  Once you complete all your fucks successfully...  Think of one more fuck...     You will realize you don't have any to give... And maybe an std to boot. You're welcome.    Edit: fuck your down votes you regular fucks
I'm typing this from Tahoe.  I just got my tickets.  Should be fucking sick..   I've been to harveys event center so probably the same.  Nevada is a different beast than cali Bro.  Come her around 10am. If your smoking (your choice)  blaze up.  Doubt you can smuggle in. Worst case stuff a bad and pipe in your shoe. Play penny slots for free drinks til iration blows your top off man.  Matisyahu never comes around so I'm stoked Bro.
Fuck your cake day
If this is a shitty attempt to go viral....  I swear.  If not I really hope we can help him.    But so help me God... If you're not dead.
Huh
I don't know what else to say...   I have been to three festivals this year...  I just got back from walk off the earth 2 days ago.... OMAM were the best concert and performance I have been to.  Nanna has an incredible voice....  They have single handedly deemed themselves the best band I can see in person.  Please see them in person.
"Stop Mr. Jones!!!!", I screamed.  It was all to real.  I couldn't believe that it happened again.  My stuffed bear was touching my penis again. Mr. Jones was a beige colored stuffed bear with a missing button eye. Oh how he was a friend of mine.  We used to do everything together.  Fish,  hike,  sleep.  Man we were inseparable.  Then as we got older,  Mr. Jones became to close.  He would whisper obscenities in my ear as I slept like "Leonardo will never get an Oscar." or "Just do it!  Yesterday you say tomorrow,  so just.....  DO IT!". One time I woke up and I saw Mr.  Jones playing with himself watching me as I slept.  Sure I was wearing some nice,  comfortable, elastic less,  tag-less Hanes underwear with a logo of Space Jam on it. Mr.  Jones whispered under his breath.... "what's up doc". Mr. Jones copulated with me that night. As he pulled down my Hanes underwear that you can find at any target store for about $7.99 for a pack of 3, I realized that I had the slightest erection. It wasn't extremely high like you get when wearing a pair of Jordan high top sneakers, which you can find for appx. $100 at your local shoe store. No,  this erection let me know that I was ready to jam my piece into Mr. Jones. I slept that night. I awoke a new man.  Rejuvenated!  Alive!  Revived like a man who was worn down but had a fresh glass of Gatorade, which is a high performance energy drink engineered to allow you to perform at you peak ability which you can buy at any store for $3.00. I felt like I was set to explode! Like the Charlotte Bobcats will once we establish a firm grip on our front office direction,  which tickets can be purchased at www.nba.com/bobcats. Ticket prices may vary.
