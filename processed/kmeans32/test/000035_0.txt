Yeah, there was a study at somepoint that looked at the full record and found just as many downward as upward adjustments, debunking that particular denier talking point. I can't find it now, but here's the next best thing, a researcher who looked into the adjustments (with some Koch funding) and found them to be legit. Even more, without the adjustments, the record would show even MORE warming than with the corrections! http://www.carbonbrief.org/blog/2015/04/prof-richard-muller-not-adjusting-global-temperature-records-would-be-poor-science/  Edit: [Found the paper](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2011JD016187/full), and [another debunking of this stupid meme](http://www.factcheck.org/2015/02/nothing-false-about-temperature-data/).
Came here to say this.   It's my most upvoted comment, ever. For good reason.   Also, just for the record, when I made the comment it was italicized like a book title, not quoted like something someone said...
IIRC the sloth sanctuary had to clean out a bunch of cages at one time and so they had to stick sloths in whatever they could find while cages were getting cleaned. Pretty sure it's in "Meet the Sloths" though maybe I'm just making things up.
Dealing with climate change and its risks will require not only technical responses like drought-resilient crops and higher sea walls but also reshaping economic and political incentives that are driving global warming, scientists said on Wednesday.
World Suffering Surge in Extreme Rainfall Due to Climate Change. One out of 10 record-breaking rainfall events observed globally in the past 30 years can only be explained if the long-term warming is taken into account. For the last year studied, 2010, it is even one event out of four.
Pope: Duty to protect planet, calls for 'social justice' on resources. He appeared to be making a clear reference to climate change doubters when he said: "It is wrong to turn aside from what is happening all around us, as if certain situations did not exist or have nothing to do with our lives."
[New York] plan calls for cutting greenhouse gas emissions 40 percent by 2030 from 1990 levels; lowering energy consumption in buildings 23 percent from 2012 levels, and generating half of the states electricity from solar, wind, hydropower and biomass by 2030.
Renewables to Beat Fossil Fuels With $3.7 Trillion Solar Boom. Renewable energy will draw almost two-thirds of the spending on new power plants over the next 25 years, dwarfing spending on fossil fuels, as plunging costs make solar the first choice for consumers and the poorest nations.

Slowbears were the first creature to be captivated by taking pictures of themselves. The practice was originally termed "slowfies" but was modified when humans began exhibiting the behavior.
I dunno, let's ask him!  Hey /u/GovSchwarzenegger, who's buying what you're selling?   What's that you say? Just all the states that are going to want a sensible and proven way to to comply with the EPA's Clean Power Plan?!   And maybe some Canadian Provinces? And other countries too as they look for ways to live up to emissions reductions pledges as part of the UNFCC negotiations?   Yeah, that's what I would've said too, Mr. Governator.
Indian Government raises solar power target 5-times to 100,000 MW by 2022, to invest Rs 6 lakh crore. With this ambitious target, India will become one of the world's largest green energy producers, surpassing several developed countries, it added.
Coal crash: how pension funds face huge risk from climate change. Coal is arguably the worst performing sector in the whole world. Pension funds, which have a fiduciary duty to make money, have no business owning any of these companies. It is not a prospective risk, it is a now risk.

Exarctly. If I thought people would actually get into it here, I wouldn't have mentioned it.   But it was a busy morning and I'm all out of fresh sloth photos so I just grabbed one from my album and went with the first thing that came to mind!
I would if I could, but this is an old image I had in my imgur, that I probably pulled from Pinterest.   TBH I only knew it was a batfish because I posted the image here 9 months ago with a different title...
IKEA, the world's biggest furniture retailer, plans to spend 1 billion euros ($1.13 billion) on renewable energy and steps to help poor nations cope with climate change, the latest example of firms upstaging governments in efforts to slow warming.
The national security threat that Republicans are ignoring. Jeb Bush, Rick Santorum, Marco Rubio and Rand Paul have, at best, equivocated, saying climate change is probably real but maybe not anthropogenic. So, you know, nothing to be done. (In millennial-speak: \_( )_/.)

Charlize Theron: Mad Max landscape awaits unless we tackle climate change. The star of the new Mad Max movie, Fury Road, has spoken of the film as a cautionary tale which offers a premonition of a world ravaged by drought and hardship unless global warming is addressed

Ice loss in west Antarctica is speeding up. Western part of Antarctica is losing mass at 121 billion tons (gigatons) a year. This rate has increased recently. In the Amundsen Sea coast, the ice loss has doubled in the past six years
I have, twice.   But let's try again: What's cheaper, a fracking rig and access to land where the earthquake would cause severe damage, or a couple of plane tickets?   What's more effective at causing fear, an improvised explosive on a bus full of people, or a minor tremor?   It's clear you have an interest in James Bond-esque fantasy, but until you get a little more believable I'd advise you not to quit your dayjob as an online goober.
Keep spreading the wealth in Californias clean energy boom. As businesspeople, we prosper when our communities prosper, and thats just what these laws are doing  despite what you may hear from big polluters and their shills.
