Which sounds like a more satisfying pair of character arcs?   Okay, in this book I'm working on I have character A and B. They're sisters. A is a button down, rule-following, reliable salt of the earth type who works the family garden, and B is a more devil may care, adventurous one and the parents tolerate it because in her adventures she has made the family more money than her sister. Both of them want to leave home but the outside world is too big and scary since their village is surrounded by vast jungle and on the other side of that are strange communities. One day there is a huge crisis in the village and in the end, both of them are instrumental in saving the day.   Which sounds more interesting as a postscript:   A. Characters A   B, having proven to themselves that they're up to facing the dangers of life head on and left their family with enough money to get by without them, plunge into the largely unknown darkness seeking new sights, new experiences, etc. Character B is more outspoken in her enthusiasm while B is more quietly excited.   B. Character A finds that now that she's experienced real danger, she's more of an adrenalin junkie than her sister, who learns that real danger isn't as much fun as the trouble she used to get in. So  Character A wants to set out on this adventure and Character B goes along to look out for her sister and to not look like a coward.   Thank you for your time
Such a ninja.
I can't tell if they're angsty or just bored.
I have no idea why this is still around. It sounds so stupid.   "I can't attract anyone who grew up in an environment similar to mine, so I'm going to pay for someone from an impoverished region to come over and hopefully feel obligated to tolerate me until they can save up enough money of their own to leave me."   The power dynamic involved, the resentment I'd imagine she'd likely feel at least subconsciously, etc. Being forever alone sounds much more enjoyable than that.
Good, half the stories in these books were so dumb that even in elementary school I rolled my eyes at them. Especially the one where the guy doesn't notice the woman who's basket he's carrying doesn't have a head or the toe/liver stories.
Times you lucked out and went into a movie completely blind.   I don't know how I managed it, but when I went to see Gone Girl last year, I knew literally nothing about it except that David Fincher had directed it which I believe massively enhanced the experience for me. I still don't really know what some upcoming new movies are about, but I've heard excellent general things about them so I'm looking forward to being able to go into them blind as well.   This goes completely against my old habits where I would get excited for movies and read several reviews of them, and in hindsight the process would diminish the movies a bit when I saw them in.

Have you ever found out you sold stolen goods?
People seem to insist this Season 1 scene is badass and I have no idea why.   That bit I'm referring to is the bit at the gas station where Walt goes up to the car of that guy on the phone, puts the squeegee against his battery and blows up his engine.   I don't get why this is supposed to be cool. At best it seems petty, at worst it seems really stupid. The guy didn't do anything to deserve that and Walt served no purpose except venting his anger in a barely understandable direction with little fear of reprisal. It seemed to me like saying it would be badass if Walt kicked an annoying chihuahua or something. I just don't get it.
Eh, I didn't need BCS to be great. We've already gotten a great series from this environment, a good one in addition to it is fine with me.
I am so fucking sold on this.
Was this under "Medical?"
Do you find a lot of the creepy images in this subreddit cool instead?   I'm not trying to claim I'm a badass or anything, I just have a thing that if something is going to creep me out, it usually needs to be ugly or aesthetically unpleasant some way or I'll think it looks good.   For example, I think the images this artist posted (NSFW) http://imgur.com/a/mg9l5 are more beautifully done and awesome than they are creepy. Even this http://i.imgur.com/noEpc2T.jpg is more moody and atmospheric for me than it is cool, but that might be because I used to take walks in the early morning when it was often foggy like that.
Not really. It's kind of forced in it's creepiness (the use of b w is a dead giveaway to me that they're trying to be creepy rather than make porn.) It's also nothing like the short story, and the author of the short story called the site lame: http://gadgets.gunaxin.com/interview-nes-godzilla-author/173878
Is Pinkie Pie autistic?   I know calling us autistic or aspies is something countless people online can't go ten minutes without doing, but this is a sincere questions without malice. /u/ScalSaver noticed some points in a recent thread about the character:   she doesn't pick up on facial cues quickly, if at all. but she doesn't quite get that other ponies don't know what she knows (= bad theory of the mind) She has difficulty understanding what other ponies are thinking.   That seems a pretty reasonable case, whether or not it's intentional.

Who's interacted with real horses?   Obviously it barely matters that the characters in MLP are horses, but just around the time I was joining the herd I got a quick gig feeding and watering horses for a family. They really weren't that nice, with only the oldest one being willing to let me pet it at all or anything.   One thing that stands out in my memory about that gig was one night it got horribly cold, like -7. I lost a bit of sleep worrying about how cold they'd be in their stables. Then I showed up and let them out for their feeding, and one of them started rolling around in the snow. I should have been she was okay, but I remember being pissed that I'd  been worrying about this horse and then it felt like she was unwittingly rubbing in my face what a waste that worry had been.
Are there any popular bits of media with sexism that you've never seen commented upon?   For example, I read this article about Clerks: http://www.avclub.com/article/the-new-cult-canon-iclerksi-2239  And I must admit that even though I'd seen the movie before, I'd never thought about it the way he put it. I'd also never heard anyone call the movie on that before either. Do you have any examples that come to mind?
Watching a clip of one of those, I thought for sure they were direct to video or TV movies.
What's the "le" thing with Reddit about?   Is that a reference to stereotypical French snootiness or something?
Is the chickenbutt thing really a joke though? I think of it more as a Dadaist commentary on language.

10 Movies   TV Shows Sabotaged By Their Creators   http://listverse.com/2014/09/25/10-movies-sabotaged-by-their-own-creators/  Few novel stories in there, a few which are kinda samey. I think the one for Un Chien Andalous is the most interesting but don't watch the clip unless you're already kinda jaded.
You must not have actually read it.   "Tusk has a lot going for it. Michael Parks has a knack for making Smiths overwritten speeches sound like prose-poems, and Smith doesnt squander that assethe lets Howes long, winding stories anchor the movie. And that Mr. Tusk costume is genuinely horrific, with bloody scars and a general ungainliness that makes the Wallace-walrus look like hes in excruciating discomfort. (Theres a scene about three-quarters of the way through Tusk where Howe forces the man-beast to learn how to swim, and the combination of Wallaces panic and what he finds beneath the water is as terrifying as anything a veteran horror director couldve staged.) Tusk also has some subtle touches that speak to Smiths personality"  I mean, come on!
As a projectionist, my reaction would be "No, LYNCH! YOU ARE NOT MY FRIEND!" Then I'd crumple up the message.

Which of these stories would you prefer be made into a game?   I was going to make a fairly crude MLP game with 2d sprite graphics (hired out, I'm well aware of my limitations as an artist and a bit overpaid.) Which of these stories sounds like a more interesting game:   A. Twilight and the others of the Mane Six experiment with a spell Twilight Sparkle found in the archives to make them "more their cutie marks." Instead of making them better at those things, they end up literally turning into those things (Applejack becomes a pony made of apple, Rarity becomes a crystal statue, etc.) Fortunately Twilight had a book of cures on hand if something went wrong.   So the games are really minigames where you try to cure the ponies of their different states, with different levels of difficulty and different reactions from the ponies (i.e. Rainbow Dash could think it's awesome that she's a pony made of rainbow-colored lightning with a mane and tail of cloud and would try to avoid being cured.)    B. The Princesses decide to let the changelings into Equestria under close supervision to bring about peace between the two cultures. The idea seems to be going as well as could be expected at first (like a few changelings can't help but try to pass themselves off as ponies, but they get rooted out quickly.) Then Queen Chrysalis of all ponies reports that there seems to be an epidemic of it happening that she can't control. It's up to the player to get to the bottom of whether the changelings are really innocent, under something else's control, if it can be made to work, etc.   I'm loosely planning that it would be a matter of trivia games to sort out who's real and not and a point-and-click beyond that.    Thanks for your time!
