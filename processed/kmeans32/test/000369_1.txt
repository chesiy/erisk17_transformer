He's making up shit. How would he know?
Outta my way, jerkass!

I can barely read this
You didn't ask for a date or anything - you're just making lame jokes for what end purpose? You need to be direct with women and stop beating around the bush. They will respect you for that and it will help outside of dating as well (e.g. in the work place).  As for your picture in the OP, I could say maybe get a haircut or something, but looks are nowhere as important to women as personality and self-confidence. But definitely lose the shag - I can see you with short sides and a bit of styling up top.

La la la la, I am not listening, la la la la.....
No one knows for certain including the people in this thread.
MM....burger
Yes
I had not considered that, so fair point.
it ran worse on my PC with everything on medium/low, despite me being able to max Inquisition and maintain 60FPS, though I can sort of forgive it due to its age, this happens a lot with older games.  Sounds like a driver issue. My 970 gives me almost 150 FPS in DAO while I get around 50 in DAI @ 1440p
Reapers are powerful, they can prevent every single intra-galactic war just by their very presence. It's easier to include geth/quarians, genophage consequences without having to drastically change the plot than including Reapers as guardians.  You can still get away with the Destroy ending - in lieu of the Reapers, the Council makes the Spectres a post-Reaper peacekeeping force. Or everyone is more happy with the Destroy ending so we don't have intergalactic war.  I think BioWare is going to go where the other games did not, or barely touched upon. There was a ton of background lore on biotics, dark matter and the sort that we never really delved into. I hope we see more of the galaxy since there are *billions and billions* of stars out there. Maybe a visit to the galactic core, or even another galaxy?
No.
Then we roll him up in a carpet and throw him off a bridge!  You don't get these faces with the new animation :(
Because creating realistic hair that moves with the physics engine (Havoc, in DAI's case) is very difficult. Look at Tomb Raider 2013 - they had that special TressFX hair and it still looked really wispy. Even in photorealistic CGI hair still looks off.  What most developers do is put on a heavy layer of post-processing on hair or fur. If you've played Far Cry 3/4 or Lost Planet, it is very evident.
An MMO should do one of two things - be honest and blatantly copy World of Warcraft, knowing full well it will never succeed World of Warcraft (WoW) - or create a sandbox where the players create the content (EVE Online). SWTOR, BioWare and EA foolishly thought to take on WoW's throne and they couldn't even make it up the first step before crashing and burning. All they made was WoW, with single-player KOTOR stories and some *okay* (IIRC) 16-player raids. They could have easily just created a Destiny-like game, or something akin to Borderlands; a story-driven game with player choice and some co-op.  BioWare could have easily created KOTOR with some multiplayer elements with the budget put into SWTOR. In fact, SWTOR was so bloody expensive [(estimates at $200mil+)](http://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-the-old-republic-cost-200-million-to-develop/1100-6348959/), they could have made a single-player KOTOR so vast, so epic in scope, it could have been their magnum opus. I think it was EA's interference that spurred the creation of SWTOR; they saw how successful Wrath of the Lich King and Burning Crusade were (the current xpacs at the time of development), and said "wow, people love star wars, let's just use WoW's formula and add Star Wars." Where have we heard that before, just in the last year with another popular single-player franchise?  From a game design and innovation perspective, most MMOs today are drastically outdated. Every single one is just copying Everquest's formula, World of Warcraft included. The only exception I can think of that takes full advantage of the massively-multiplayer environment is EVE Online, where by players run the economy and political structures in the game.   We can argue that most games are built off previous games, as nothing is inherently "original." BioWare has essentially been remaking Baldur's Gate for the past 17 years. But that is what they're good at - creating interesting *character-driven, single-player* experiences. Not MMOs. The MMO genre has been stale since 2004 - the year when WoW released and EVE was celebrating a 1-year anniversary. Unless you enjoy WoW, there is literally nothing else to play that is inherently different except EVE Online. Why would you play SWTOR, or EQ2, or ESO, or Age of Conan? They're all World of Warcraft, with some twists here and there, but they all fail to live up to WoW's amount of content, class balance, lore or player base.
wtf? Did EA or Ubisoft go down or something? What is this shit, OP?

Wow very solid build man. Ask for a 1440p monitor for Christmas, $300 from Korea (ebay) :) Do you have a disc drive to install Windows?   Do i need a cpu cooler (other than stock)?  Only if you plan on overclocking your CPU (which the 4690 can do in spades). I have the same cooler as you - let's me get up to 4.5GHz on my i5.  Do i need thermal paste?  Yes. They're dirt cheap and necessary   minus an anti-static wrist band, anything else i need to fully build a pc?  Get an old credit card for the thermal paste. If you have a friend with a nice toolbox, ask to borrow it (or get your friend to help build!).
Can confirm, I am the same person. Wanted to get the post out there but couldn't do it from this account due to Reddit's self-posting rules to reduce spambots.
Banu for commerce, hands down every day of the week. The retaliator is a bomber and little more.  Caterpillar is more of an in-between, as its designed for boarding and trade.
To melt or not to melt 890 Jump...   I have been eyeing the Banu MM and Starfarer for quite a while. I love the dirty, more cyberpunk feel to the ships than the 890 Jump. But the Jump is limited edition.  Do you guys think I should hang onto it? Right now my cart has the Super Hornet Upgrade, UEE Coat and the Aurora LX.
Absolutely. Best MMO on the market in the "theme park" genre. Everything about the game screams polish. WoW is the only MMO I can install, jump into and simply play without having to dick around with controls, graphics, annoying UI or weird mechanics. It's fairly simple, it's fun and it works.  On the 21st they're having their 10th anniversary special day, where they're releasing a special 40-man raid with a free mount, pet and helmet.
I'll be Gus, the lovable engine sweep; clean as a whistle, sharp as a thistle, best in all Westminster, yeah!
Because meaning would be defined arbitrarily, simply on the whim of the individual. Who has the final say without some universal standard? These are the questions I asked myself for 10+ years on my path back to Christianity from Atheism.  I am not claiming to know anything; they're just fun questions to challenge ourselves with once in a blue moon.
I would be very wary of anything Nitesmoke is telling us. First, he comes out as some social justice champion for LGBT rights. What? That shit is completely unrelated.  Second, he's changed his story multiple times to cover up his own childish behavior. He couldn't play WoW for a couple days and had a suck attack. That's the whole story.
[CANADA] [H] PayPal [W] GTX 670 2GB for SLI   Looking to buy a GTX 670 2GB for an SLI setup. Looking to get one for around $120-150.  If the 4GB version works with the 2GB version (my current card), I can take one of those instead.  EDIT: ~~Bought one from /u/brictop~~ Scammer  EDIT2: Did some research AFTER I sent brictop money. Turns out he is likely a scammer. Called Visa and Paypal. Both said they'll get me a chargeback if I don't get the card in 2 weeks (standard shipping speed). Just a warning for others out there buying from this guy, use caution. Don't be like me and take people's word at face value. I'm just thankful I will be able to get money back.
I am a Christian and one of the last duties Christ gave was for us to go out into the world, preach the gospel and baptize people in the name of the Son/Father/Holy Ghost.  But the way these street preachers "spread God's Word*" is not the best way to go about doing that imo.  I won't go into it much since this isn't /r/christianity, but basically Christians should follow like Jesus did - he performed miracles, signs and aided people *then* followed up with his message as people inevitably asked questions. Most of the stories or parables in the Gospel are told *after* someone comes up and asks Jesus "Hey, Rabbi, why should I do y or how do I do x?" I never recall Matthew 45:16 "Then the Son of God went out into Los Angeles and held up a sign and preached to all the sinful nerds and they were saved that day."  *Funnily enough, most people think "God's Word" is the Bible. In Islam, God's Word is a physical book (the Quran), while in Christianity, God's Word is Jesus himself. The Bible wasn't even completed and compiled yet when John 1:1 was written...

Throne of Thunder is considered a Legacy Raid and uses the old loot system. You can run each boss, regardless of difficulty, once per week for a chance to get a Secret. Once you kill a Throne boss, your chance is used up for that week.  Siege of Orgrimmar uses the new loot system. You can repeatedly kill the first 8 bosses in LFR/normal for 1 secret per boss, for a total of 8 secrets.  Additionally, Lei Shen and Sha of Pride have a 100% drop rate on your first kill.  So if you're really unlucky, you can still get 9 per week. 1 Lei Shen, 8 from Siege of Orgimmar if you grind it out until each boss from Immerseus to Nazgrim drops one.  After that, you need 12 Runestones, which only drop from ToT Wings 3  4 and SoO Wings 1  2. Me and a guildie grinded out the Runestones in a single day, as we were very lucky with the drops from Throne of Thunder. After that you need the Heart of Lei Shen, which you can run Pinnacle of Storms again the same week as Runestones and he will drop it guaranteed.  If you have 0 Secrets, you can earn 9 guaranteed this week if you grind SoO 1/2 and kill Lei Shen. Say you are unlucky again and only earn another 9 next week: you will be unable to get the Cloak. You need to get at least 11 Secrets this week to even have a shot at getting the Cloak.  You have 2.5 weeks, as Warlords launches on a Thursday. Good luck.
Don't become me. Started with an Avenger ($60, reasonable price for AAA game) - Cutlass - Freelancer - Freelancer MAX - Constellation - Phoenix - Reclaimer - 890 Jump. I now own a Jump and the AMD Mustang. No more buying ships D:
