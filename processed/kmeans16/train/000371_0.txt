aren't feasible  I don't know what you're basing that on. Consider this:  **A + B  B**  Increasing the number of stages in the food production process by eating animal products, rather than plant matter first hand, creates waste. According to Joni Seager et. al in The State of the Environment Atlas, In cycling our grain through livestock, we wasted 90% of its protein and 96% of its calories. An acre of cereal can produce five times more protein than an acre devoted to meat production; and legumes (beans, lentils, peas) can produce ten times as much. Thus the greater the human consumption of animal products, the fewer people can be fed.  An omnivorous diet wastes resources that the world just does not have. Faced with a growing population, we must use our resources as efficiently as possible so as to avoid famine, conflict over scarce resources, and climate chaos.  **Land**  According to a UN Food and Agricultural Organisation 2005 report The State of Food Insecurity in the World, a varied vegan diet only needs a fifth of the land of a typical European omnivorous diet. The animal industry has a devastating impact on the land. Expansion of livestock production is a key factor in deforestation. In a process known as hamburgerisation cattle graze on cleared land, moving to yet more land once they have destroyed the fertility of the soil. World Resources Institute assessments suggest that 20-30 per cent of the worlds forest areas have already been converted to agriculture. To feed animals in order to eat animal products will not satisfy humanitys food needs.  **Water**  Animal production uses huge quantities of water to grow crops for their feed, for them to drink, and during the processing of their carcasses. A study financed by the California Beef Council found that the production of one kilogram of beef uses 3700 litres of water, the equivalent of 40 baths or 300 toilet flushes. A different study from Cornell University put the water usage for one kilogram of beef at 100,000 litres. For comparison a kilogram of maize uses 77 litres, wheat 119, and barley 2174. With more than one billion people already unable to access enough safe water to meet their needs5, and this number likely to rise, we must prioritise a sustainable diet over a meat-based one.

I've uploaded the original jacket design picture to imgur: http://i.imgur.com/DJsWuOI.jpg  The text of the article reads as follows:  Tolkiens original dust-jacket design for The Hobbit is currently on public display as part of the Bodleian Librarys Marks of Genius exhibition.   It sits alongside other treasures of the Bodleian Library including a 1217 engrossment of Magna Carta, Shakespeares First Folio, the Gutenberg Bible, and much more.  The exhibition aims to look at ways in which attitudes towards genius are manifested in a number of remarkable books and manuscripts, and exploring how works of genius found in a university library can be acquired, collected and read.  It is located in the newly-opened Weston Library (Broad Street, Oxford), which houses the Bodleians archival collections including a substantial amount of Tolkiens papers. The exhibition will close 20 September 2015.
Can you see how my question is consequent to my suspicions regarding your story as a whole?  Have you ever heard of the subreddit /r/IAmAFiction ?
That site is terrible for pop-ups, I grant you. I watched the whole of *Samsara* with a hellacious, heavy metal soundtrack in the background. I thought it was part of the film. It was just the music from an unnoticed pop-up in a different tab.  I hope you manage to see it. Perhaps try again or using a different device if you can.
At least 44 Conservative candidates in the 130 seats that will decide the election have either worked for banks and other finance companies or accepted political donations from them.

I've just received the following email from someone at Coursera  Thanks for contacting us and for your patience while we investigate your issue!  I can confirm that Buddhist Meditation and the Modern World will start on June 15th 2015. We sincerely apologize if the change in course dates caused any disruption to your schedule. We thank you in advance for your understanding, and we look forward to having you join us again in June 2015!  Best,  Eddie  I was going to respond with a similar wise-crack on non-attachment but you've beaten me to it. A chance for me to practise noble silence then.
Keep clocks forward to boost health, say experts   **Keep clocks forward to boost health, say experts**  Permanently moving the time zone forward an hour would encourage children to do more exercise, according to a study that has revived calls for Britain to ditch Greenwich Mean Time. MPs, scientists and charities argue that putting the country on central European time would have significant benefits for public health, road safety and the economy.  The main proposal is for Britain to have the clocks two hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time in summer and one hour ahead in winter, giving people more light at the end of the day throughout the year and effectively placing the country in the same time zone as France and Germany.  The idea, known as Single/Double Summer Time, would give people about 200 extra waking hours of daylight each year. It has broad support among backbench MPs.  Rebecca Harris, the Conservative MP whose private members bill for a review of Britains time zone was defeated by a filibuster in 2012, said that there was a strong case for bringing new legislation after the general election in May. Its certainly possible that perhaps in the next parliament it might be picked up, but there are already campaigns around the country trying to get it into various political party manifestos, she said.  When my bill was going through the Commons it had considerable cross-party support. The big health benefit was seen as being having an extra hour of daylight in the evening when children and adults are more able to make use of it for extra recreation and being outdoors.  Jacob Rees-Mogg, a Conservative backbencher who helped to filibuster the bill, said: That we tried it before and reversed it [between 1968 and 1971] and Portugal did the same indicates that people do not like long, dark mornings. Essentially, there is not enough daylight in the winter and muddling with the clocks wont create any more. Scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the University of Bristol found that children in nine countries got more exercise when sunset was later.  Shifting Britains time zone to match other western European  countries would lead children to do two minutes more exercise each day on average  an increase of 6 per cent, they said. Anna Goodman, the lead author of the research, which appeared in the International Journal of Behavioural Nutrition and Physical Activity, said:Introducing additional daylight savings measures would affect every child in the country, every day of the year, giving it a far greater reach than most other potential policy initiatives to improve public health.  Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, said that the idea should also be revisited for its environmental benefits.  A separate study published today suggests that seasonal affective disorder (SAD), a form of depression that affects sufferers acutely during the winter, may be more widespread than thought.  In a YouGov survey of 2,000 people, 8 per cent said that they had clinical SAD, while a further 21 per cent said that they suffered from the condition to a lesser degree. Previous studies have put the level at between 3 and 4 per cent. In all, 57 per cent said that their mood tended to be worse in winter.  Lance Workman, professor of psychology at the University of South Wales, who oversaw the research for the Weather Channel, said that SAD could be due to mankinds poor genetic adaptation to living in northern latitudes. We havent lived at these latitudes that long  only 50,000 years  so we may not be particularly well adapted to winter.  Ms Harris said: A lot of people wrote to me saying they suffer from SAD, and they would much rather have the extra hour in the evening.  Oliver Moody|The Times|24/10/14
In what sense?
Truth - R.S. Thomas (1963)   He was in the fields, when I set out.  He was in the fields, when I came back.  In between, what long hours,  What centuries might have elapsed.  Did he look up? His arm half  Lifted was more to ward off  My foolishness. You will return,  He intimated; the heart's roots  Are here under this black soil  I labour at. A change of wind  Can bring the smooth town to a stop;  The grass whispers beneath the flags;  Every right word on your tongue  Has a green taste. It is the mind  Calling you, eager to paint  Its distances; but the truth's here,  Closer than the world will confess,  In this bare bone of life that I pick.
This can't just sound a little fishy to me.  Yes. You are not alone.
How does reading this make you feel?:  Suddenly it occurs to me that maybe this is our last conversation. He could be dying, the pills already drowning him, pulling him away. I should be nice. We should be talking about nice things. The drives in central Illinois, those miles, so straight, where you could drive eighty, ninety, the windows down, corn gone, just raw gray fields, where you felt like you were plowing through time itself, like you were a huge loud missile tearing the earth in half, leaving grateful ruin in your wakebut also knowing, we knew, we always knew, that really, at least seen from anyone elses perspective, it was not that way. To cars going the other way we were a quick loud noise, a flash; seen from aboveeven a crop duster would have given you the perspectivewe were nothing like thatnot loud, not powerful, not affecting much at all, not leaving any ruin, not making any noisewe were just some little black thing puttering straight on the straight road, producing only the smallest buzzing sound, crawling through this flat, terrible grid.  "So, whats it like? Ive had, you know, relationship problems," I offer.  _________________________  From 'A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius' by Dave Eggers.
That seems to work in some respects. I was thinking more of something that specifies an ability to take on board criticism well. It may have been upekkha but I think I might have recognised that. I'll keep my eyes peeled.
I have 'delta'd' someone who, to my mind, managed to deserve it. One's man's argument is another's debate. Whilst I was curter than I would have liked to have been as a result of needing to keep up with the oncoming traffic and not neglect anyone (that is until this thread was censored and civilisation's progress impeded in the process), I believe I have helped expose some 'home truths' to those who would otherwise not have heard it through the moans of enablers, nor smelt it through the fetid miasma of their own inertia and self-deceit and have learnt one or two things myself about the brave, unheralded labours of some of my fellow men and women of science who are attempting to redeem video games.  I will only change to improve! Semper fidelis!
* I think my point was that video games become **more powerful** by virtue of their being **less open to interpretation**. I've not played Final Fantasy 10 (DAE think that is a ridiculous name. Like, 'Last of the Mohicans 2: Back with a vengeance!'). Is there a conscientious objector option or does one have to contort oneself into 'killer mode'?  * It wasn't an arbitrary statement/belief, sadly. I'm trying to help people. The lives that I will 'save' and the potential I will emancipate is worth my time. Of course it would be better if nothing had to be 'put down', that better world does not exist. Here in this world is suffering and dissipation. There are those things that lead to suffering and dissipation. And there are those who encourage, and those who discourage, those things that lead to suffering and dissipation. Often the opposite of dissipation leads to suffering. As often, and arguably more dangerous, is when the opposite of suffering leads to dissipation which then leads to increased suffering.  * Eminem has talent. I wonder what his 'Elegy for a Gamer' would sound like. Full of withering criticisms, no doubt!
Portrayals of healthy sexual relationships?   I was racking my mind to think if I'd read any novels (and plays/poems) that portray a positive, lasting sexual relationship.  Just as I was writing this, I remembered the relationship between the protagonist of McEwan's 'Saturday' and his wife. Apart from that, I found examples a bit thin on the ground.  Can anyone provide me with examples in literature in which a long-term sexual-relationship is depicted as happy and healthy and non-neurotic?
