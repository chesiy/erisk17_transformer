Check the major retailers' websites first. Nike, Footlocker, Champs, etc. to see if they have the colourway you want. If not, then go to eBay. As /u/stewpidteenager said, *get a legit check first*. Last think you want is some fake shoes.  How you would go about that is posting a link to the listing on here or some pictures of the shoes and the nice members of this subreddit will help you out. Cheers, and good luck.

No, not that. It was like an actual *game*, with a story and a goal I think. I just know it wasn't Medieval Games. Thanks though
I don't know man. Do you like them? That's really all that matters.

First heard about this theory [here] (http://www.djbooth.net/index/news/entry/2015-04-06-chance-the-rapper-new-album).  I mean it makes a good bit of sense I guess but I don't think that much logic is behind it.
Thank you for educating a young fellow like I.
Definitely a close 2^nd for me.
Lol, thanks. It's there now
