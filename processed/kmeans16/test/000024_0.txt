Who is Ron again?
Maybe you are right, but I'd argue that there are very few names that get remembered over time (this is not to say Villa is bad).  Just consider Spain alone, in the past 10 years or so, I'd say Xavi, Iniesta, Casillas, Raul are bigger names than him (not comparing skills here, just saying these names are more well-known), and probably Puyol, Ramos are at his level. There you've got 7 or 8 names already for that decade, so in 50 years basically there would be 40 or so players of, roughly speaking, his level or better. I doubt anyone could remember 40 names from one country (even if it's your country) unless if something special happened that made you remember him.  And plus, people tend to remember more recent players and forget old ones. How many players from the 1960s can you name?
Well said.  I think as a Chinese player playing at his level, the state will have an important say on your career, perhaps even more than you and your family. The state may make certain decisions and "recommend" those to you. So yeah, not saying that he will necessarily do well, but he definitely won't be like Josh Waitzikin, who just suddenly ditched chess.
He did not say the result was representative, in fact, at the bottom he explicitly said the result is NOT representative.  The last thing to keep in mind here is that people who answered this question primary come from Reddit and Voat, so naturally, we are expecting the younger generation here (likely around the 2030 range). Gallup, for example, did similar polls and their results (which should be more representative) demonstrate entirely different results.
Do you think Greece will remain in the EU given its growing concern of defaulting, and will you adjust your investment strategies accordingly?   Question 1: Do you think Greece will remain in the EU given its growing concern of defaulting?  I've created a poll to help tally up opinions. Please vote http://thearima.com/questions/do-you-think-greece-will-remain-in-the-eu-given-its-growing-concern-of-defaulting.  My personal guess this some sort of bailout will be reached at the end (as that's what has always happened). Greece will remain in the EU.  Question 2: Will you adjust your investment strategies in the next few days/weeks according?  I bought some VIX etfs last week, and have happily enjoyed my 30% gain today. Given my answer to the first question (i.e. they will stay in the EU), I would likely clearly out my position in the next few days as I think the VIX index will rise a bit more and then go back down.  I'd love to hear your thoughts!

ELI5: Why do most calendars list Sunday as the first column even though Monday is the first day of the week?
I think it's a great season. What do you all think?
11 facts about data science.   Someone was sharing on LinkedIn and I thought it's interesting for data scientists.  1. Data is never clean 2. You will spend most of your time cleaning and preparing data. 3. 95% of the tasks do not require deep learning. 4. 90% of cases GLM will do the trick. 5. Big Data is just a tool. 6. You should embrace the Bayesian approach. 7. No one cares how you did it. 8. Academia and business are two different worlds. 9. Presentation is key - be a master of PowerPoint. 10. All models are wrong, but some are useful. 11. There is no full automated data science. You need to get your hands dirty.
Some honest opinions.  1) Why is your team so big? Why do you need 6 people and what do each of them do?  2) Traction to date?  3) Slides 5   6 - I would avoid using the pictures you are using, they make the deck look unprofessional.  4) Why do you want to raise 125k? How do you plan to use that money?
I didn't meant to say it was my own. Just found it funny and post it here.

Thanks for the links!
A few things  - I think you should purchase your own domain, and get a serious hosting service (not one that puts ads on your site). These things are cheap nowadays and they really make your site professional.  - I don't like sites with black background, this could be a personal thing.  - I think you should have somethings that explain what you do (other than saying you track maintenance), e.g. a video or a faq page or some visuals. It is hard to get people to sign up for something without know what it is. For example, I'd like to know (before I sign up) how you track my much I drive and when my next maintenance date is (I think that depends on time as well as how far you drove right?). Do I submit my mileage, do you estimate it based on my driving habits, or do you track with an app?
