Trying to play minecraft classic for memories, but when I go on a multiplayer server, it says you failed to connect to the server. It's probably down. It says this on every single server. Any suggestions?
What the hell went through your mind when posting this? It's not even funny. Just two cucklords giving each other genuine advice.
Since this is r/ Pixar, I assume someone knows how to create an AllPurposeMaterial in Renderman. Can you any Renderman fans point me in the right direction? The Pixar documentation doesn't give clear instructions.
Don't waste your time with greedy fucks like Autodesk. There software is hard to use and you will get an error even when you do the most simplest thing. He'll need experience with programming. Modo sucks ass. Start with blender, have him learn cycles rendering. Then, he should move to maya. If he's looking for games, use unity or cry engine. Unreal lags like hell.
Reddit, I don't think I can go on for much longer. It's so hard. I'm running track, but I lose a lot. 4th place in hurdles. You'd think that's good, but no I get compared to my cousins...     I've had enough. This has gone on forever. I will never be good enough. Plus my dad called me a dick and always yells. I find refuge in creating levels and unity 5. I bake textures in Blender cycles and then send it to unity so the graphics look like fucking Gravity. It's amazing. I thought my family would be proud. But no. My family said I spent too much time online, which I felt was a fucking erroneous assumption, since I only worked on the project for 30 minutes each day before going outside and trying to please everyone in track.     It's killing me. I can't go on much longer.

Please help. Having trouble with lender to cryengine exporting materials.     Every time I bring in a texture in as a .tiff or .psd, nothing shows up. It's just a "Replace Me" cube. What do I do? Please don't point me to the manual, as I have already read it. The cryblend manual dosnt work either. Tell me please, what are the steps to add textures to my blender exported model. Maybe I'm not doing it right.
Simply realistic looking terrain.
Winning the race really
I'm animating cgi for a film and discovered ptex, but when I try to export the textures on my model, I get an invalid argument error? I know this isn't r/ vfx, but I'm on a time stress, I need answers!   I'm trying to get my ptex from mudbox to maya, but the textures won't extract. http://imgur.com/tHLAMLI
I have blender, after effects, and element 3d. As well as renderman and luxrender. Will this be enough to create industry standard effects?   I'm just so worried about vfx for my films.
What do I do? I joined two models but now there is a noticeable line from where I joined them.     I sculpted this head a used a uv sphere to make the back of the head. It looks great from the front considering im a first time sculpter: http://imgur.com/hgZuR4a But on the side there is noticeable "pinching": http://imgur.com/5UDuVmd
I'm tired of it... It's always about my family, never about me...     Greetings Reddit, I think I'm done.  I can't take it anymore! I have no one to talk to!   I'm such a loser, one of my teachers has a strong disliking towards me, I live in my cousin's shadow, and my dad was never there for me...   One day at school, I had had it. I was gonna do it. I tried to tell myself that I was being irrational.    I went to the counselor. They called my mom. Rather than being supportive or consoling, she got onto me for telling the school, saying that they're going to label me.   I wanted to talk to my dad, but he is overseas. He doesn't give enough of a care.   I have no one to talk to. I'm a popular guy, and have many friends, too many to count, but yet, I have no one to talk to!    My parents and my friends are only concerned for themselves. It's always them, not me...   I can't tell you how many times I've been cheated out of birthday celebrations, or have never been called by my dad.    I can't do it Reddit!
Thank you, my good sir!
A few rules.     1. Play nice. Try not to flame. Let admins defuse the situation.   2. Don't post things that are retarded and unrelated.   3. Post prehistoric content other than dinosaurs from time to time.   4. No religious references. I have nothing against religion. I am quite fascinated by it. But "God/Allah did it 6000 years ago" doesn't satisfy our thirst for prehistoric knowledge.
Because, if you watched the videos I put links to, you'll see their massive numbers. Plus, that was only a small fraction of 4chan. Us Redditors have been a thorn in 4chans side, so some think they plan to launch a campaign. Plus they wouldn't stop at griefing, it would be followed by the hacking of admin accounts and Ddos attacks.
