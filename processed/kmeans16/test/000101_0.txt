I got someone for $100 right now so I'll let you know if that doesn't work out.   Honestly $100 is already a pretty good price so I wouldn't go lower than that. I could sell it on eBay for more but that's kind of a hassle with Paypal fees and what-not.
I was also kind of hesitant on the MM version but I definitely wanted a New 3DS XL. I heard there was going to be a limited supply of both (obviously much less MM editions) so I went down to Target right before opening to try my luck and get at least one system.   I managed to get a system and my god it is GORGEOUS in person. Pictures really don't do it justice. The gold is dark and understated, and while I usually hate glossy finishes this one looks so damn sophisticated, like the decals are infused with the system. I feel like a matte finish would have made it look sprayed or stenciled on.   If you have even the slightest inkling for keeping it I would highly recommend it.

Square looks much better but it might not be the shape. All the ones from your home try-on are too narrow for your face. Your rectangle ones right now are the right width. Try more pairs that are wider (Warby's website has a filter).
Your hair is the perfect type to do something like that in the picture. There is about no way to get your hair to look like that without using product, at least at first, so don't worry about how your hair grows at the roots. You will be able to style it like that.   In regards to clothes, just read the sidebar and hang around on this sub. Go thrifting and experiment with clothing. Remember, fit is king. Slowly but surely your style will develop and you will start looking the way you want to.
J. Crew are definitely one step higher than Uniqlo's. Fit is more on par and quality is definitely higher. Just feels like a more quality piece to me.   I usually grab my J. Crew's at around $30, so they are well worth the $10 difference to me. Whether they are $30 better is up to you.
American Eagle is slowly moving towards simple and minimally branded items. While some of their items still have flashy logos, you can find some really nice two tones or color-blocked sweaters and shirts.   Also, most of the brands you find recommended on here (J. Crew, H M, Uniqlo) have no branding whatsoever.

I have a Cooler Master N200 ([Newegg](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811119274)) used for only a year in like new condition, no huge scrapes or scratches or anything. Could use a good cleaning, sorry I don't have a hose or I'd do it myself! Name your price and your location to determine shipping price. Will come with two 120mm fans.
From what I know, you can use the first and second generation touch and type covers on the Pro 3, it just won't cover the screen all the way.   If you're waiting a while before purchase see how much money you have when you want to buy, and how much the Surface Pro 2 goes down in price. I think your decision will be much clearer then.
No, this is a Let's Play!
I'd say social life is really depended on each individual. If you want to have fun and be around people, then you will find people that want the same. If you just like to work, then you can do that.   The social scene is definitely here, and if you want to be a part of it then you can. You will do a fair share of work here but most people take it in stride and have great social lives in addition to the work they do.   Hope that answered your question.
Thanks!
I don't really see the difference between the two questions? Sure, the second one is more specific but a good reviewer will talk about how the workload impacts social life when asked just the first question (because it's the greatest factor in how social you are). Same for most questions on the page, they sound like generic questions any freshman or college review websites would ask.
There was an incident that happened during Orientation Week at my school... it is now known as the "Brown Leg Incident."  During the first night of school a guy invited a girl to his room, and they began to get down and dirty. His roommate was trying to sleep on the top bunk and got so fed up that he left to sleep in the lounge. One of the RA's walked by and asked him what was going on, and together they went to investigate the room.   While the two lovebirds were alone they had switched to anal sex, and were going at it full force when his roommate opened the door. The shock from the door opening and the ongoing sex caused her to unleash her bowels in full force all over the guy's leg, and due to crappy school food it was runny and full-on disgusting. We all ran out of our rooms from the sound and saw the couple covered in shit and fully embarrassed.   Both students switched dorms after that.
CATERPIE!!!
