That is a beautiful vintage ride. Check the tank for rust, if the tires are old they'll want replacing, be sure chain and sprockets are in good shape. Old carbs can varnish, consider a thorough cleaning. The shocks are likely shagged, this era motorbike never did handle well-consider replacing, and the forks need at minimum new oil if not rebuild.  If you're not mechanically inclined consider investing in a professional's care. I know the lads at my local Honda shop (who are a good lot) would LOVE to work on an old girl like yours.  Happy trails!

Rossi: Four title fighters - no Marquez crisis
I believe that /u/BobSagetBaseGod is trying to tell us that his/her aunt and cousins used to listen religiously to the advice of the quack Mercola.  But I'm not certain
Down California you've got 101 and 1 on the coast, I-5  down the middle-if you like agriculture there's plenty here, and 395 east of the Sierra. I live in Olympia WA, my sister lives in Santa Cruz CA so I know them all well. Returned yesterday from a trip down the coast to San Luis Obispo, east to 395, then up the interior home again. 2800 miles, took a leisurely 7 days.  One of my favorite stretches is south of Eureka, cut over on 1 on the coast from 101 at Leggett. Very twisty, though forest then you can smell the sea and the ocean is before you. If you're staying in motels reserve ahead by midafternoon 'cause things fill up in the afternoon, but there are plenty of fantastic campgrounds, too.   You are going to have a great adventure, but don't worry about missing anything-it'll be there for the next trip!
Don't be superstitious. I'm more worried about Marquez. The longer you ride wild, the more the chance for a serious getoff. Doesn't he already hold the record for the fastest noninjury crash?
When a patient has been in the hospital for a week and there is a crisis at night when cross cover needs to figure out what is going on the narrative of their hospital course is not optional. If I can't figure it out from the notes I must reconstruct it, which hardly is an advance in patient care. I'll take a pithy, short surgeon's note over the long empty templated progress note anytime.
After years of trying to groove on Mr. Coltrane's later work I gave up. For me this is the pinnacle.  Nice, long shots of Mr Tyner's hands.
I delivered liquor  c for Turner's at Sunset and Larrabee in '72. Drugs, sex and general weirdness as far as the eye could see. Even met a few celebs. Joan Rivers was not a nice person, but Dobie Gray was. Jim Hutton (Tim's dad) was a jug a day fellow. Died of liver cancer. Guess I helped kill him, in a way. Saw John Lennon at John Mayall's place in Laurel canyon-my oh my did my eyes bug out.
I'm no reed man so beats me, but bird often used that white mouthpiece.  Methinks Bird's got an illegal smile.

It's hard to disagree. Certainly those single individuals had an enormous influence on so many lives throughout history, but the structure of modern society is so strongly shaped by Roman precedents. America's founders took as their model not some religious ideal, but a Roman one. Washington was the quintessential Patrician.
What a great find, thanks.  [Here](http://www.standard.co.uk/incoming/article9887141.ece/alternates/w620/odyssey.jpg) are Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood November 2014 (photo Glenn Copus)  Edit: found a [slide show](http://imgur.com/gallery/WvyDm) of stills from the production of *2001*
Still creepy, though.

My humor is so bad its mistaken for griping. I'll shut up now. I like the sub.
Lieutenant Randall H. Cunningham and Lieutenant (junior grade) William Driscoll pictured in an F-4 Phantom II fighter. On May 10, 1972, during aerial combat over North Vietnam, the pair shot down three enemy MiG fighters before their aircraft was hit by a surface-to-air missile, forcing them to eject. These three kills, combined with two recorded previously, made them the Nay's first and only aces of the Vietnam War.

I think it's Hickory House.  Edit: nope, Downbeat on 52nd  "Seen in the mirror is Gillespie and the Barbara Carroll Trio, which worked opposite Dizzy Gillespie at the Downbeat Club from July 18 and into August." (New York Amsterdam News, July 19, 1947, 19: Ad).
Well they certainly are cool, great pic.

*Hell's Angels*, Howard Hughes, 1930. Even today the air combat scenes are among the most believable (alas 3 pilots and a mechanic were killed during the production). The explosions are real, unlike the flash and noise spectacles since. And Jean Harlow uses the line "wait here while I slip into something more comfortable" (she's wearing very little to begin with) for the first time. Because it's pre Hayes the dialog gets a bit spicey.

Inquiring minds want to know!   Living in Olympia WA geology is in your face and after reading McPhee I've got the bug. I am working through *Earth* 10th ed by Tarbuck *et al*, several books by David Alt *et al*.  Is there a geology equivalent to *Sky and Telescope*? The stuff I see is more oriented to rock hounds. Blogs or forums for amateurs? When I get some time I'd like to ramble around the scablands; any recommended spots? Thx!
