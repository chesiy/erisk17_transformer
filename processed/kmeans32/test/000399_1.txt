There are only two numbers on the hotness scale. 0 - people you are not attracted to, and 1, people you are. If you desire to have sex with them, do it. If you're worried that other people will say you're not with a girl who is attractive enough, then you need serious work on your inner game and not caring about what other people think of you.

I opened the second picture and literally said "oh fuck off, he's way too good looking for this sub." Keep up with the weight loss and maybe try a more mature haircut, and you'll be beating them off with a stick.
If you don't like small talk, then don't do it.   Steer the conversation towards something more meaningful and with more substance. This comment is hardly the place to explain that full process but there's plenty on /r/seduction about it - but basically, get them talking about something they are passionate about and that you can have an interesting dialogue about where you both learn something. Politics and religion are probably not the best topics for obvious reasons, but once you've gotten through the basics of a meeting (who are you, what do you do etc) you should be able to either find something you have in common which you can discuss, or if you have nothing in common, ask them to explain a topic for you. For example: "so you're a biochemist? I honestly know nothing about biochemistry, can you explain what makes it so interesting to you?" People love to talk about what they are interested in, and it's the best way to a) make them feel like they've had a great conversation and b) learn something new for yourself.
Doing it with a big grin helps a lot. Also, be 100% confident right through the activity. If you falter or think "I'm being annoying," somehow, that's when it is annoying. But if you just keep going like it's a hilarious joke then it is for them as well.
Thinking of "pushing your belly button in" for vocal support is a terrible idea. I'm a professional singer, and I've personally suffered from using that mentality - it causes vastly too much airflow below the vocal folds and can cause you severe vocal damage in the long run. It also doesn't help you increase your volume because you are still basically shouting, and it reduces the amount of oxygen that is used by your lungs.  I can''t teach you how to breathe properly here, because that's a serious job for a face-to-face professional. But you *must* not focus on consciously contracting your abdominal muscles (or pulling in your belly button) - you are tensing the rectus abdominus muscles rather than the transverse abdominus groups, which is exactly the opposite of what needs to happen, as the rectus abdominus must stay as loose as possible in order for support to function at all. Your body will use the transverse groups to support speech automatically (this is how any air is moved over the vocal folds at all) and consciously thinking about it is the best way to interrupt this process.  There are plenty of exercises and resources on the internet that can aid you in this, but there is also a lot of bullshit. You want to look for Accent Method Breathing for singers, which is over the top for an everyday speaker, but exactly the right thing for everybody to be doing to some extent.
There's a great statistic (well, horrible in real life, but great for the sake of the argument) that usually stops females who dismiss male rape as impossible - 50% of women orgasm when they are raped. I don't have a source for that but I read it somewhere on /r/sex and I remember there being a very reputable source, it may even have been /u/Maxxters that posted it.   It's quite obvious when you think about these things that the body's physical reactions are different to what the mind is actually feeling.
Well, yes. You know what I mean.
This kind of discussion comes up in this subreddit on a weekly basis, if not more. Every single time, a guy explains in detail about why we can't share our emotions. Then some chick comes sweeping in with "oh, but I personally just *love* it when guys open up to me! And I'm sure lots of other women do too!"  If they actually did, the problem wouldn't exist. For precisely the reasons you outlined above.

You have a great point. If you ask women what they find attractive, and it isn't you, is that really their fault? It ties into the idea that the most upvoted response in either subreddit is usually the one that pleases the males the most.   I say this as an unattractive and unconfident male who feels worse when reading these types of threads - but I wouldn't expect anyone to change them just to suit my fantasies.
Hey man. I'm in the same place as you and currently working on it, and I'm much happier for it. Have a read through /r/confidence, /r/faimprovment, and /r/seduction and see if there's anything that encourages you to work on your confidence - unfortunately the only person who can improve that is you, but I know you'll feel better about the whole world if you do. Just my two cents.

It will get better. Trust me. No matter what happens, you will get through these exams and shit and into a brighter place. PM me if you need to talk it out any more, any time. Really.   And I hadn't intended it to be, but I love that band and I love that song! Cheers brother!
Exactly right. Even though I'm relatively new here (been lurking for a bit), I think this subbreddit would benefit from a mentality of being a team where we can beat our problems together - *more* than just a place where we can talk it out (though that's great too).
It's absolutely not your fault. At all.   What I'd meant was that I had unwittingly been an example of how men see an emotionally strong and confident male, and the benefit that such an attitude of emotional self-reliance brings them, and instantly try to emulate it - or believe that they are inferior for not being able to do so. It's a knee-jerk reaction to someone you perceive to be 'better' than you.
Apple in the mouth?
The pope agrees
No. INDIVIDUALS run the world. The fact that most of these happen to be men is an accident of western history. There are just as many men who need help for various things as women.
Thank you!

r/seduction would have an apoplexy if the guy gave a girl his number. But I think it builds a bit of trust and makes you look less like yore just trying to get in her pants. Opinions, anybody?
Well laaa di dah
Being in a relationship is just like being really good friends, but with sex. If you're not having sex yet (totally understandable at her age, and it's important not to pressure her) then you don't even need to worry about that. Hang out, go to movies and shit, do whatever you would normally with other friends. Don't have sexual contact with anyone besides her. There is an implicit emotional connection; you will probably be her go-to person for emotional support, and likewise.   The bottom line: have fun. It should be about opportunities, not duties.
Dude. She's talking about sex stories with you. Clear sign that (to quote Superbad) she wants your dick, in and around her mouth.   All you have to do now is make a move and go get some!
Dammit Jesus, you fuck everything up.
Swimsuit? Where are you waking up, in a creek?
Exactly.
Because of the twist ending I didn't realise he didn't actually write that for a while.
