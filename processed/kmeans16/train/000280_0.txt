TIFU by being too curious   So there is a show (albeit a stupid one) that I don't remember the name of. Now, I was young at the time, so I was scared of pretty much anything. Anyway, I was browsing through the TV show list, and I saw that show on the list (called "haunted" or something). I knew it would be scary (yes, I could read at the time) so I asked my mom if I could watch this. Now, she was in the shower at the time, at the other side of the house, so she thought I said "Hunting", so she told me I could watch it. (Hunting is also inappropriate for kids, but OK mom.) I watched it, and it was something stupid about fairies, but I got spooked. The next day, I went to s-c-h-o-o-l. SUCH A FUN EXPERIENCE! I was afraid to go to the bathroom, cuz everyone knows those darn fairies will get you if you're alone in a bathroom, so I peed in a bush when no one was looking. That bathroom thing went away after a couple of days, but I was still scared of the dark for a long time. TL;DR: I got spooked by scary fairies, had to piss in bushes.
