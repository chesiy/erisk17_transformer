It has always been like this. Or at least since I have been on /r/science. The top comments are always variations of these themes:  - "There is nothing new about this. This has been known for some time."  - "Correlation does not imply causation"  - "Sensationalized clickbait title"  Most of the meaningful discussion happens when you scroll down.
St Louis is getting hammered!
TIL that the myth that the Great Wall of China is visible from space originated before anyone had ever been into space, and dates back even as far back as the 18th century.
Absolutely fascinating, all of this, but this part doesn't seem to have any backup based on the links provided, and seems anecdotal (thus the highlighting), can someone help?  December 3rd  The second data leak. This one garnered less press but contained was considerably more dangerous... **I've heard** that much of this information was available because an IT director was comprised apparently he had no background in IT and was actually a marketing exec who reached the position (and thus higher salary) through corporate politics. You can see for example is was good at naming files.  (this is not to detract from the link at all, I'm just curious)
Army researchers develop pocket-sized aerial surveillance device. It can, for example, give Soldiers the ability to see around the corner or into the next room during combat missions.

A lot of Brazilians are going to be **really** pissed off about this. Search the words "luto" or "vergonha" on twitter. I'm sure there will be another catchphrase of the night.  Edit: yes, there is a new hashtag, that was quick: #RIPBrasil
[This comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/ebola/comments/2igp2w/nurse_infected_with_ebola_in_spain/cl23a5d) from another thread is worth reading. I cannot vouch for the translation. Relevant and eye-opening quotes:  (edit: emphasis added)   The infection event is still under investigation; **she went twice into the patient's room**: once to assist him and then after the former patient died. No accidental contact was reported.   The infected nurse went on vacations the day after the former patient pased away. Her husband is being questioned to elaborate a list of people with who she was in contact.   First symptoms (temperature under 38.6C) were reported on September 30th. She has been controlled twice a day since then. She mostly stayed at home.

TIL that one of the most famous actresses of the silent film era in the US was Alla Nazimova, originally from Russia. She had romantic affairs with a number of other actresses and coined the use of the phrase "sewing circle" to refer to closeted lesbian or bisexual actresses of her day.
Just for some perspective, [here is the solar system at an accurate scale.](http://joshworth.com/dev/pixelspace/pixelspace_solarsystem.html)

Not many. Don't shoot the messenger! I just pointed out that they have a rule and that it's strictly enforced. I'm neither endorsing nor disfavoring the rule.  ^(The story in this post I find personally very interesting, however.)
The process by which the medication was made available to Brantly and Writebol is highly unusual. It may have fallen under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's "compassionate use" regulation, which allows access to investigational drugs outside clinical trials. Getting approval for compassionate use is often long and laborious.   A sad fact is we're looking at years if not decades before this treatment is approved for widespread use after the requisite clinical trials, and even then it may be prohibitively expensive for use in Africa. I may be proven wrong, but I don't see it being distributed to the hundreds of sick in the current outbreak.

TIL there is a plant in Australia that grows completely underground. It even flowers underground. The "underground orchid" never sees the sun, instead it feeds on a fungus which grows on the roots of an outback shrub.
The British were awful to the Australian Aborigines, no doubt about that, *but*, from OP's first paragraph:   A number of historians point to **introduced disease** as the major cause of the destruction of the full-blooded Aboriginal population.  A similar thing happened to native populations in Central and South America upon arrival of the Spanish.  (edit: formatting)
This needs to be higher. FGM is only widespread in Africa and has little to do with radical Islam. I hate ISIS with a passion, to put it mildly, but this story doesn't make much sense. I'll believe it when they themselves publicize it.
Where baby sea turtles go after hatching on the east coast has been a mystery for decades. Now it is solved. They go to the centre of the Atlantic gyre, where they use seaweed for foraging and shelter.
OK, well best get the characters to wear green for St. Patrick's day on game day three then.
And I guess the third place finisher can be full of "what if"s too, but in the opposite direction. i.e. "What if I hadn't done that turn so well, and missed out on the bronze!". Hence, feeling better in the situation than the silver medalist.
It does. The research article is [here](https://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6164/1367.full) and says that [codons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code), the three-letter codes in our DNA that stand for an amino acid in protein synthesis, can **simultaneously** code for an amino acid **and** a transcription factor binding site. [Transcription factors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor) control the expression of genes, i.e. turning them on or off. These dual-use codons, or "duons" as they have called them, represent the "second code" that OP's article is talking about. Even though I only just read it, it looks like a big deal.
TIL that Thomas Jefferson was the most multilingual President of the US. In addition to English, he was fluent in Greek, Latin, French, Italian and Spanish. There is also evidence he studied Arabic, Gaelic and Welsh.
And went on to save the galaxy from the Reaper invasion.
Indeed. Interestingly, these plants still possess a chloroplast genome, which has been sequenced. Since chloroplasts are responsible for photosynthesis, you would think that in this species, which has literally never seen the light of day, the chloroplast genome would have been lost over time. However, Rhizanthalla still retains a tiny number (37) of genes in its plastid genome, suggesting that chloroplasts have functions beyond that of photosynthesis.

Out of interest, here is Willem de Kooning's ["A tree in Naples"](http://www.moma.org/collection/object.php?object_id=80116) which is mentioned in the article. I wish there was a picture of the 4 year old's painting!
The paper they are referring to was published in 2010 and has been cited [only one time](http://scholar.google.ca/scholar?cites=3836192125356317566 as_sdt=2005 sciodt=0,5 hl=en). Not saying it isn't interesting, but this hasn't looked to have gained much traction since then.
TIL that the concept of an atomic bomb was introduced in a novel by HG Wells in 1914. Eighteen years after its publication, the physicist Le Szilrd read the book, was inspired, and two years later filed a patent on the idea of a neutron chain reaction, leading eventually to atomic bomb technology.
TIL that before the world wibe web, internet users had multiplayer role-playing online games called MUSHs. This stands for Multi User Shared Hallucination. These games were played via the unix command line, i.e via text, no graphics, but were enourmosly popular amongst college students at the time.
