What's the most romantic moment you have experienced that was unplanned?
Have you tried **Quartermaster General**? It's a fast playing 3 vs 3 WWII game that plays under an hour. Easy to pick up, varying player powers for the 6 countries, and surprisingly each game plays out quite differently.
Wow! Really looking forward to this. Stronghold games has become my favourite publisher. Lots of solid euros: **Kanban**, **Panamax**, **La Granja**, then **504**.
Went to a weekend convention here in the UK so I managed to play 33 games last week, but I'll just post the memorable ones :P  **Elysium** x2 - Very simple yet brain burning drafting + set collection game. Plays within an hour and a lot of player interaction for a Euro. It was a hit at our con. Only complain is that you're never sure what will be available next round (unless you play with a certain deck).  **Roll for the Galaxy** - Full of interesting decisions yet very quick. One of the most played games at the con. The other two are probably Elysium and Quartermaster General.  **Argent: the Consortium** x2 - My fifth play and still enjoying it thoroughly. Everyone was in the run for winning until the final reveal.   **Panamax** - Played it many times but this is the first time to play with a full table of experienced euro gamers. Lots of table talk. It was INTENSE. Scores ended up 94-94-108-114 which surprised all of us.  **Terra Mystica** x2 - Still my all time favourite. Riverwalkers were fun to play with.  **Aquasphere** - I wish it could be more strategic. Ends up being very tactical and you just have to be at the right place at the right time.  **Captains of Industry** - I love economic games but I'm starting to have mixed feelings about this game. The random time tracker can be annoying at times.  **Mottainai** - It felt like a constipated version of Glory to Rome as the pool was always empty. Just doesn't flow as well, but perhaps we made some rule mistakes.  **Red7** - A pleasant surprise following the disappointment in Mottainai. Very clever and fluid game once everyone understand how to break ties. I should pick up a copy.  **Scoville** x2 - A decent game. Both times I played the final round seemed like an anticlimax though.  **St. Petersburg (2nd ed)** - Clever game, but gives a clear advantage to experienced players who know the distribution of cards by heart.
1. **Terra Mystica**  2. **Agricola**  3. **Mage Knight**  4. **Kanban**  5. **Castles of Burgundy**  6. **Panamax**  7. **Concordia**  8. **Le Havre**  9. **Brass**  10. **Glory to Rome**
Yup. It's not about drawing well, it's about highlighting key concepts and getting it done quickly so you can start guessing other people's drawings.
All pretty safe bets for ~4p games: **Lords of Waterdeep**, **Dead of Winter**, **Sheriff of Nottingham**, **Hanabi**, **Castles of Mad King Ludwig**, **Dominion**

I really enjoyed this game up until the last few rounds. Then it's a repetitive motion to bash the leader because players may only win at the beginning of their turn, not the end. This draws out an extra 30 minutes. Obviously this matters less in a 2 player game.  If it wasn't for this mechanic for game end, I'm pretty sure it would be a top-250 game on bgg.
I'm not sure whether it's worth it to back the kickstarted version and wait 8 months, or just buy a copy now.   Speaking from my own experience, you will like the game if you enjoy:   1. Pool and engine building; a main difference from other "pool-builders" is that you start off by drawing 4 tokens each round, but this ability could be upgraded to a max of 8.   2. Indirect conflict only (race on the map, buying a building someone else wants, buying the last token etc);   3. Feld games, i.e. not thematic, multiple ways to get victory points; and   4. Games that are not too unforgiving. Had a bad draw? You can place say, one token to a building that requires 2 tokens. You don't activate the building this turn, but it increases your chances to fill in the remaining token later for a big turn later on.
For every single game, there will always be people who hate it/regret buying/rate as a 1 on BGG etc. I think it's always important to decide for yourself (and your group) whether you like a game or not, especially when trying out a new type.   It's also a very popular game so it's also likely that you could trade/sell it away if you didn't like it after all.
What are some Causes   Effects that most people don't realise?
I'm a new gamer (~2 months)  but already highly addicted to boardgames and I've played 6 days last week to try find games that I like. It was tiring but well worth it:  *Loved it*  **Terra Mystica** My third time playing it. I bought the game and this was my first time teaching newbies. Enjoyed the game playing the dwarves. Hoping to try the mermaids/swarmlings/alchemists next time.  **Lords of Waterdeep with expansion** Played original game once. This was the first time with expansions. With 6 players it was still very good but I think it would be more enjoyable with 5.  **Russian Railroads** Loved it! I diversified too much and ended with 275 points. Will definitely replay, even consider buying it.  **Tzolkin** x2. Played this many times already. Still loving it.  *Liked it*  **Pandemic** I like how easy to learn the game is and how everyone gets tense during the game.   **Nations** Played with 3 players. Went for military strategy and was very tight on resources. Will play again.  **Eclipse** My first long game (lasted 6 hours with 6 players). It does give you a great sense of achievement. Just didn't enjoy it at times when it took too long between turns. Not a big fan of war/dice rolling as well.  **Agricola** Learning game, got 22 points. I like the mechanics of the game but it felt a bit too restrictive to me. I enjoyed Caverna more.  **Ra** I quite like the design of this clever bidding game. Would replay.  *Alright*  **Coup, Quantum, Modern Art the card game, String Railway, Marrakech, Serenissima**  Hopefully I could game 4 days this week. Already looking forward to trying exciting new ones!
