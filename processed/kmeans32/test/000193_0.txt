That was literally my reaction upon reading Peter Straub's the Buffalo Hunters from his collection "A Room without Doors," which would fit in pretty nicely for this thread. The guy makes himself wallpaper out of baby bottle nipples and then rolls around against it. He also makes himself a nice nipple bedspread. It was like who agreed to publish this? Other highlights from the collection include a child learning hypnotism and using it to torture his toddler aged little brother with a hat pin and another story about skipping school to go to the movies and becoming the daily target of a pedophile.
I'm a college drop out myself.  I also make $20k more a year than the average American woman.  I own a house, I'm married, and I have an eight month old baby.  I can afford to pay my mother for daycare, so she doesn't actually have a job outside the home.  Basically, I'm a bad ass and I regret nothing.  If you can take control of your situation and figure out what YOU want and how to get there, no one is going to look down their nose at you for not finishing school.  Success is subjective.  Your family, ultimately wants you to be happy and healthy.  There may be a bit of disappointment initially, but you need to do what you need to do to make yourself happy.  No one else is going to advocate for you.
Well, thanks to an uneventful weekend and FX, I'll say she did the best she could with the material given to her... I mean, what the hell can you do when you are written a line like "You nick-named my child after the Loch Ness Monster?"  She had roles before and after!  This seems very insufficient to me.
Conspiracy Theory Time: I think they only show these photos taken of him shortly before his death in 2002 because they're more in line with what we imagine when we think of a serial killer.  He was actually very conventionally attractive when he was active, that is how he got so many ladies to sleep with him... He kept an index card system with over 74 women he had sex with, and that, for the most part, did not include his victims.  [Here is what he looked like at the time of the escape of Christina Almah.](http://www.toptenz.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/crutchley-vampires.jpg)
Okay, let me try to help you... I think you should look into getting yourself some corduroy pants (it was like pulling teeth to get my husband to buy a pair for our wedding, but then he wore his to death for four years and I had to throw them out in the night because of holes.... most comfortable pants he ever owned), a sweater collection (lots of variety here homes, you can be Nero from Sons in a Cardigan, rock a sweater vest like a cute little hipster, or go classicly preppy in a nice pullover).  I think you should hop on over to Uniqlo.com for styling inspiration... it doesn't have to be boring.  I wouldn't be caught dead in slacks and a polo either.
I think we established this when I said I had a 31 inch inseam and no torso ;)  Also that I have a thigh gap and C-cups... Believe it or not, I have almost no fat on my face... what you're seeing is cheekbones.  It's very weird.
You've got this wrong... if you see us next to actual children, we're obviously not children... it's when you lack proper context that people get confused.  Your character needs to be at an event with a bunch of adults.  I'm routinely offered a child's movie ticket and children's menus, but it's only when I'm out with taller adults... I'm nearly 30.
Cream cheese and green olives! :)
Sorry for double replying, but I had some more things I wanted to talk about here, upon thinking about it.  I think that we don't make the draft a priority because at this point in time, it's a non-issue.  You register, but can you even imagine how the nation would have reacted if they had drafted for the controversial war in Iraq?  It would have been pandemonium.  You have to prioritize here.  You register for the draft, you get a free razor, you'll never be called into action because the times have changed.  My main focus on civil rights actually has nothing to do with feminism.  It's to do with educating the people in my area about assimilation of Native Americans.  I live on the edge of a reservation and the amount of racism is unbelievable.    If you asked me to give my complete agenda as a feminist, it would merely be that I want white men to speak out when they see things that are unfair, even if it is going to be unpopular.  This isn't unique to feminism, but to that casual homophobic remark that is made among friends, or that racist joke someone made that you don't agree with.  Instead of laughing along, I'd like to see white men recognize that they have the responsibility of setting the expectation for what is acceptable and what is not and use that power for good.  This doesn't seem crazy to me.
1) I expect nothing.  2) Haven't you ever seen those posts on Facebook where they show like a turn key for opening a can of sardines with text like "Like if you know what this is... Don't give it away!"  3) You know what I'm sick of?  Older people telling me about how unfortunate I am to not know what it is to have spent my childhood outside or to be unwired.  Hello, I didn't have a cellphone until I was 21, and we were outside all the time.  My SNES had a strict half hour a day limit on it.  It's called parenting.  By the same ticket, it's not "impressive" that I listen to talk radio or like Led Zeppelin.  4) What even IS a 90's kid?  I was born in 1987, and I'm the first to admit that anything prior to 1995 is a bit blurry.  I found out who Nirvana was at 15.5 years old.  Yet I'm told people born in '98 consider themselves to be 90's kids?  Call me crazy, but I think you should probably have to remember the actual decade to associate with it.  Like my husband.  Graduated HS in 1994.  THAT'S a 90's kid.
Y-you got a reservation?  But how?  Damn it, Sean!
Calm down, I'm just remarking surprise since I would have expected you to say something like "I'd be the person who comes to your house and breaks your arms for asking the same question I saw five times yesterday alone."  I'm old, married, and, yes, I have bad taste.  You don't need to tell me you have no interest.  I'm just trying to have fun with you. :(

Not anymore, young'un.

Well, I've heard it said that your same-sex parent will set you straight and hold you accountable, while your opposite-sex parent will believe you can do anything and that you're the greatest thing ever.  I would imagine if I'd had a father (not my father, he was an addict and died when I was 12, but you know, a normal one) I wouldn't constantly be grappling with the self-doubt I got from my mom always telling me I'm wrong or that I'm confused or that I'm bringing things on myself.  I'm grateful she did, because I'm very successful and I have a strong sense of right and wrong, but I wonder what I would have been like if it had been tempered with a little of that blind faith that I'm amazing.
I actually think it must just be poor context.  The only context of this word that I've ever heard that stuck with me was when it was used in those mid-90's Duncan Heines commercials... Moist is totally something I like in a cake.  Now congeal?  Or coagulate? PASS ON THAT.
I think it's quite beautiful to recognize that you're young at heart and to be young for as long as you can be.  I mean, we're only getting older, you'll never get the chance again.    I think you just need to do some things that make you feel smart and competent.  For me, that is traveling.  I never feel as smart and free and independent as I do when I'm in an airport.  When you travel alone, you can indulge in your childlike wonder at the world around you.  You can be you without thinking yourself to death the way you do when you're just home alone.    It's good to think the best of people and to be curious about them.  That alone will get you far as many people love to talk about themselves.  If you ask questions, typically you don't need to worry about expressing yourself too well, because the other person will go on a bit.  While I can be a chatty Kathy (obviously) I'm intrinsically curious about why people do what they do and how and what they feel about it.  So while I am largely awkward, having met my best friend at 23, a lot of people consider me to be their friend merely on merit that I've asked them things and listened to their answers and remembered little things about them.   The wonderful thing about being a human being is that if we don't like our circumstances, there is rarely a situation where we can't change them completely.  I totally encourage you to think about the things you like to imagine you are brave enough to do and to just do them.  No one ever lies in their deathbed and says "I wish I had spent more time worrying and waiting to start my life," right?  Be brave and be you and do everything you want to do.  You deserve it.  You only live in this wonderful world once. :)
I'm sorry that you're having such a rough time.  I can't speak about your culture and I won't presume to, but you asked if it was true whether no matter where a man is from, he'd be bothered.  The answer to that is no.  I'm an American.  I did not come into my marriage as a virgin.  My husband could not care less.    I hope things get better for you.  Please feel free to PM me if you're ever lonely and need a sympathetic ear.  You are more than your currency as a potential mate.
Well, I'm not bald, but my husband is.    When I was 20 weeks pregnant, we got one of those 3-D ultrasound photos of our unborn daughter.  She already very clearly had my husband's nose.  When I would show it to people, I would say proudly "She already looks just like her daddy," and more than one person, totally serious mind you, would say "Oh, because she's bald?"  Guys.  Come on.  He shaves his head.  It's not a genetic trait.  She came out with a Mohawk, incase you were curious.
What I did was to put Former before their job title and company, so the reviewer would understand the connection.  If they want to know about current situation, they can ask when they call.  I formatted my line items like this:  *First Name Last Name* / Former *job title here* - *former company name* / Relationship to me (e.g. Past Direct Supervisor) / *Phone number with area code*
I'm not sure if you're actually asking me or just making a point, but to err on the side of optimism, no, it told me to set the counterweight at 2.    I've looked up anti-skate and what I'm getting is that everyone has an opinion on it and I probably need some sort of test record to set it?
This is interesting to me.  My husband once told me that he never suggests any solutions to my problems because he simply assumes that anything he could come up with would be something I already thought of myself.  He's rather missing the point (which I've told him)... it's the act of making an effort that matters, not the outcome.  It's the same with this, the act of trusting someone enough to tell them what you really feel.  From your response, you're either someone with anxiety (like me) or you're with someone who isn't good to you.  In either case, I'm sorry that things aren't easier for you, and I hope they get better some day.
Okay, I think I've been waiting for almost 15 years to see someone ask about this so I can say:  All or Nothing.  I have seen All or Nothing.  It has no plot, you can't understand a single thing they're saying without the captions, it's depressing, and confusing.  But sometimes I see the preview again, and it is literally such a good trailer that I think to myself... Maybe I just didn't get it the first go round.  Maybe I should see it again.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qz6RreTMEyA
I've got a new theme song for you : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AhKO4NXJA4  Apparently it is not so weird of a phenom that it prevented Ryan Adams from singing about it on what is arguably one of the best country albums ever written.

Hello ExDrK;  Almost all jobs have a 30 day grace period in which either party can terminate the working relationship without notice.  Sometimes this is included in the offer letter, sometimes it's just a disclaimer form, sometimes it is in the Non-Disclosure agreement.  I would got to your HR representative (or call the phone number for the service they use) and ask.  Just be very apologetic and professional and nice.  The truth is that most employers don't really want employees who don't want to be there, it's more respectful to just come out with it.    Hope this helps!
Well, when I was four, my mom asked me what I wanted to be went I grew up.  I told her I wanted to be an artist.  She said "Artists don't get paid anything until they're dead."  So I kept my eyes open.  At five, I went to my first funeral and met a friendly mortician.  I wanted to be a mortician until I was, like, 14.  You can see I had a fucked sense of humor even then.    I'm not a mortician, but I have succeeded in making something to the tune of $200 in my lifetime for art.  Look out!
The fact that you down voted only the reply where I wrongly accused you of being obtuse makes me love you a little bit.  I'm sorry. (I'm being 100% sincere.)
If you get one from me, I either agree with what you're saying, find you well spoken, was entertained, or appreciate your support.  Getting one seems 100% random.  You never know what redditors will like, it seems.
I don't think so.  Here is why: I once encountered a boy who was not very solicitous or interesting or funny or even a good sport.  He was not conventionally attractive, in fact he was a bit overweight and kind of looked like a penguin.  But when I would sit down next to him, I would get hyper, mega turned on.  I couldn't sleep next to him, I was too aroused.  It had to be pheromones.  I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that he had no similar reaction to me.  I think the real question is how much of any of this had to do with the fact that I'd been on hormonal birth control for five years at that point.
I have seen them all, and I don't like any of them.  Apart from uniformly suffering from pacing issues, he just can't seem to help himself when it comes to cheeky jokes within his films.  He just seems so damn pleased with himself!  Also, three of his most famous films completely missed the point of the reference material thanks to his casting choices.  That is very upsetting to me.
