About 2.5 years. Had a blast though and spent the rest of my career trying to get back out to sea.
Sounds General Quarters!
Yep!

Thank you!
That's amazing!
We were deployed with the navy and ESG5 back in 2004-2005. After the deployment, instead of going back through the Pacific, we proceeded up through the Suez, with a stop in Jordan first.

Those look amazing! I felt myself starting to slip into littlespace just looking at them! WANT!  Also, you're rather adorable in your Snuggies XD
Here's a thread about them: http://defence.pk/threads/ccg-2901-and-ccg-2501.346531/.  Former Coastie here and I love seeing various Coast Guard (or Coastguard) ships of the world.
What. The. Actual. Fuck.
Good for you.
Phew! It's all good :D

The Seventh District (which covers South Carolina, Georgia and most of Florida) is one of the busiest districts if not the busiest. Miami and Key West tend to have a lot more cutters. And some of the smaller cutters (87', 110') are sometimes homeported in small towns.
Fantastic! I shall be joining both shortly!
So freaking cute!!!
I wore cloth as a kid. My brother was the one to wear disposables... I might be able to make a small cloth diaper for her.
True, but it would look better than a 24/7 on her :P  I'm not in a rush though. But I love the idea of making my own!
I agree with /u/Mattykinss. Munches are a great way to ease into the community and get to know others. Most munches are vanilla type events due to their public setting.   The biggest key is to communicate. Check out the Big Little Podcast episode on [Communication](http://www.biglittlepodcast.com/2012/07/episode-56-communication/). If she already supports you in this, it sounds like you would be able to talk to her about it and have her listen. It's going to be tough, but it will be worth it in the end. Trust me, going behind her back is no bueno. And even if she doesn't want to go, at least she knows you're being upfront with her and open about it.   One additional thought would be to find out what kink she's into (assuming you haven't done this already) and support her in that. But that's just my two cents.
I've been there before! Quite a bit. Thankfully, I've gotten past the binge and purge stage but it's taken a while. I'm at the point where I'll wear (when I can), but I've realized that this is a part of me. I hid it with my ex-wife and let's just say that things did not go well when she found out. But, I wear when I can and have also realized that no one really knows but me. And if anyone **does** figure out, chances are they won't think it's because I enjoy wearing. So, I know it's hard to not feel that shame, but once you accept that it's a part of who you are, and the rest of the world be damned, it gets a lot easier and that shame fades.
All my friends are dead.
