This REALLY is starting to piss me off about Joe...like sometimes I legitimately think he's a bit of a racist who gets away with the "I'm a comedian" card but he's clearly not pushing those limits that frequently or that flagrantly so I tend to just overlook it.   But you can't tell with what sounds like fake enthusiasm sometimes. Its an important subject but many times it sounds like Joe flat out disagrees with these same talking points with a different guest.
Five million public school students in Texas will begin using new social studies textbooks this fall based on state academic standards that barely address racial segregation. The states guidelines for teaching American history also do not mention the Ku Klux Klan or Jim Crow laws.
I believe it's similar to the situation in Russia. Putin too intelligent and worldly to be as personally religious and homophobic as his policies and statements reflect, but the Russian people are something like 80% orthodox and not too fond of the gays, and he's ultimately culpable to their opinions.    if you saw the last season of House of Cards, the russian leader kinda reminds me of what you're implying.
Amazing

Did Obama come out as an atheist on Marc Maron's podcast?   Its been well documented that he grew up in secular humanist homes and his grandparents and biological parents were both non-believers.   During the podcast he remarks on how diverse his religious upbringing was but that the social values of respect and accountability were what he took away from it.

How is it not considered treason or sedition to support the confederate flag or ANY sort of confederate acknowledgement?   I know we have to avoid the whole "winners write history" problem, but during a civil war, the side that wins...WINS. You don't get to keep showing the colors of a failed state and proclaim that those people were americans who just wanted freedom. No. They were traitors and they lost. Not to mention all the other messed up things associated with that flag.
At what point is the white community going to address systemic white supremacy actively planning and targeting minority communities?   It never ends.  We have racist cops participating in Klan meetings, we have racist cops shooting at paper targets of black youth for practice, we have websites dedicated to white supremacy and subreddits that condone violence and economic oppression against people of color, and we have a media that refuses to even use the word "terrorism" or use unbiased reporting when it comes to issues addressing overt acts of vengeance against people of color  As a person of color...its tiring to have to defend yourself against all of these barrages on your character, your community and your desire to just be treated as normal.   We've fought for every war. We've participated in every level of government. We've clawed for respect and justice.  So when will the white community speak out about whats going on in their community?
Snowden did not take any files with him to Russia. As a teacher of Chinese counterintelligence, he knows how to keep his data safe. Neither the Chinese nor the Russians stole his data, nor did they "break the encryption", this entire story is utter nonsense and transparently so to anybody with a modicum of crypto experience.  Thats a nice cover-up to avoid the fact that they really had no tight clamp on the data that they claimed to   So Greenwald says "my files are safe"...and it turns out they're not.  So where does this leave us?
I don't agree because you're not offering any immediate practical solutions instead of holding out for ambiguous, non-specific pie in the sky bullshit.   This sounds like a great fiction story...but this doesn't help us RIGHT NOW.  So no, keep that "border-less world" crap to yourself. Its not even relevant...and its insulting you could be that naive to even try to use that as a talking point.

I DO understand it.  But i'm asking if its really and truly a good idea.  Theres a lot of people in the US who I absolutely think don't either appreciate what it takes to run a nation like the US or has the balls to be assertive enough to lean on other nations in large geopolitical matters.  I partly worry that the average person is either uneducated or simply...too nice and thus, naive.
Not remotely the same thing.
Good point. We need more density IN ADDITION to commuter lines.   Turning ATL into Boston/DC-light isn't a bad thing  We don't need a damn train to lovejoy. We need lines to west midtown, to EAV, to VAHI, collier, etc.   We do. The Original plan was to go to Griffin
