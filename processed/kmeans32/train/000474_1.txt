HEALTH – STONEFIST [noise rock]
Thanks!
Test?
Thanks. I heard that it may be out sometime earlier this week, perhaps because of the staggered release of Developer Beta 3 and the Public Beta.
Low Power Mode for sure
Crystal Castles – Frail [electronic]
Mine is very crashy. I can open it, but doing a small number of things within the app quickly crashes it. Lame....

I took it for a small number of months as well... Now I feel trapped in a fog of apathy.  Withdrawal was awful but I knew that the medication was doing nothing but poisoning me.  My father is a retired physician (cardiologist) and I must say that having some of the "most accurate" knowledge of Western medicine at one's fingertips is not always such a blessing.  If anything, the few psychotropic drugs I have tried—zoloft (sertraline), celexa (citalopram), and effexor (venlafaxine)—have done nothing but worsen my apathy and general desire to stop living.

"A while ago..."
ayy
Nothing has been released that will actually be on the album, as far as I know. Have you heard ["Go?"](https://youtu.be/vIi57zhDl78) I realize it's a collaboration, but still:  It is evidence of her experimenting sonically. *shrug*
Same here. I have found that the medicinal/therapeutic effects also depend on the quality/type of weed, but mostly my mind-state before and during consumption (i.e. if I'm feeling negatively or overtly anxious it's probably not going to be much fun).
I’m sorry…. Hopefully a new build will be out this week to move your experience in a better direction.  On the upside, just be glad you’re not using the just-released Surface 3…apparently 10074 is rather unusable.
Uhhhh.... Ever read much into the Holocaust?
same..
**"Platform" lyrics:**  **verse one**  Neon lights on the dust on the ground on the bus  Dirty roads makes that scarf wrap a must  Rolling by scrolling for the future on the app  Data mine my mind like a diamond in the ruff  **chorus**  Platforms here's a train of thought  Getting to the bright side of me is why I fought  I'm gonna say what else have I got  Maybe there's glory in all the things I'm not.  **verse two**  If oil is the god then the cranes all pray  The crude is so rude  It makes the people pay  On the side of the road men make money  A flower for a dollar man  He wants a family  If I rose to power  It'll be a bouquet  Emoji a smiley  And say I'm OK  The tech dudes are the only ones having a good day  And talking is cheap  Coz they make it easy.
what do you prefer and why: sencha or fukamushi-sencha?   hello, i am going to be posting a simple preference-based question every few days just to help myself and others flesh out a greater understanding of the subtle-*teas* inherent to the world and culture of *camellia sinensis*.  so, for round one, the questions arises from the japanese tea tradition.  do you personally prefer the delicate freshness of a traditionally-steamed sencha or the heavier, more robust cloudiness of a more thoroughly-steamed fukamushi-sencha?  why?
If you're in the mood for something a bit different (smokier) than your standard Earl G., Harney amp;amp;amp;amp; Sons' Earl of Harlem is supposed to be pretty excellent.  I've been meaning to pick some up myself, because their teas are pretty damn awesome:  https://www.harney.com/ambessa-the-earl-of-harlem-20-sachets-tin.html  Also—and I am speaking from experience here—Rishi Tea's Earl Grey Lavender is absolutely delicious (and pretty luxurious, particularly with some cream and honey):  http://www.rishi-tea.com/product/earl-grey-lavender-organic-black-tea-blend/black-tea  For something a bit less pricey and in bags (although the flavor profile may not be as "interesting"), here is Rishi's plain Earl Grey in sachets:  http://www.rishi-tea.com/product/earl-grey-organic-fair-trade-tea-bag/tea-bags
