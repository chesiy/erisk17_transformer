EFF YEAH!!!!!!!
Just do a combination of all the things you imagine when you think of **Canada**, and that's me.
*Gulp*
No one of value is going to tell you your story sucks. Like everywhere online, there are always a few jerks who will find something to poke at in the story, but believe me, they aren't fellow writers.  Even if you were to specifically ask one of the writers to critique your story, they're not going to flat-out tell you it's bad. They're going to give you tips on improving it, so please don't be afraid to post. You'll never be able to please everyone, so just hope for indifference, and if you get good reviews, then jump for joy!
Fun! What a fun question! :)  I rather enjoyed writing [There's nothing in the dark that isn't there in the light](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2piqpq/theres_nothing_in_the_dark_that_isnt_there_in_the/), though the story wasn't exactly popular. I'd say [I thanked the man who murdered my only friend](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2sr06h/i_thanked_the_man_who_murdered_my_only_friend/) is my favorite, though. Mostly because it features one of my RP characters, the crow guy. It was a lot more fun to write.
M-my cold and loveless hearti-it's melting...
Hahahahaha!

Why waste time on old stories when you've got a slew of new skills and experiences at your disposal and you could just create something new?  For the same reason we renovate homes instead of building new ones: it creates jobs which, in turn, helps the economy grow. DO YOU HATE THE ECONOMY, KNEEOD?!  No, no wait. That definitely doesn't make sense. Let me try again.  Because  it keeps away the termites? Yeah. That's the reason. Termites. Let's keep them away.  (I can see the benefit of wanting to rework a story. Sometimes, you love the idea, but hate how it was applied, and want another kick at the can. I'd be inclined to go back and fix some of my stories if/when I release an anthology. 'Cause the formatting on some of my earlier ones makes my eyes bleed. And some of them weren't up to par. And termites. TERMITES EVERYWHERE.)
This. Absolutely. Yes.
There's also a rumor that you can rent /u/mikerowphone for a day and have him follow you around, reading all the stories for you. It's hands-free, image-free, distraction-free NoSleep browsing---for the low, low cost of "like, just a couple human souls."
That cat knows how to put the 'ow' in 'meow'.  ...  That was a lame, lame pun, and I feel pawful about it.
Oh my gosh, he does kind of look like him!
Congrats! :)
Totally not a judgement, xandra, but instead of asking whether we wondered the same thing, why not flat-out ask where the ideas came from? A lot of the NoSleep authors visit the OOC and are more than happy to answer questions. Mind you, we're a comical bunch, so we might just tell ya our oven mits talk to us at night and give us our ideas, but it doesn't hurt to ask.  Hypothetically, if you ask, I'd tell you that my ideas just come into existence out of the blue. Sometimes, I see an object and a story weaves itself from there, sometimes I'm taking a shower and the voices in my head write a story. It all depends.
That's actually adorable. I mean it.
Bad things happen when you steal a person's final breath   First and foremost, I would like to formally apologize to the families of Rene Jackson, Brandon O'Neil, and Adrien Carter. I did not know them well, but they seemed like very smart young individuals with bright futures ahead of them. What happened was entirely my fault, and I would do anything for the opportunity to go back and make things right. The word "sorry" doesn't even begin to describe how I feel. The guilt is tearing me apart, but I will endure it for the short time I have left in this world. I hope you will find it in your hearts to forgive me, though I will not blame you if you spit on my grave for the rest of your days.  I work as a medical examiner in a county hospital, mostly handling autopsies of John and Jane Does that come in at night. Since I work the late shift, it's not uncommon for me to spend hours alone in the morgue. It can get a little lonely and boring at times. Fortunately, I work at a teaching hospital, where we regularly welcome bright-eyed residents ready to take the medical world by storm. They expect to be hazed by their attending doctors and nurses, but not by someone outside of their inner-circle, which is exactly why they get sent my way. The attendings watch and hide as I scare the unsuspecting doctors-to-be. We typically have a good laugh about it afterwards. No harm done. Last week; however, something went terribly wrong.  I was about to start an examination when Doctor Chang phoned to let me know three new residents were coming my way. He typically gave more notice, but I could manage something despite not having my usual prep time. Three eager residents showed up before I even hung up the phone. They told me Doctor Chang had sent them to retrieve a ring for a grieving widow: a classic excuse to justify a trip to the hospital morgue. I rested one hand against John Doe 901-8A's chest, and waved the trio over with the other. Using the gloved hand that had touched the corpse moments prior, I introduced myself and offered them a handshake. I could see them cringe, but they were too polite to refuse. I stalled Miss Jackson, Mr. O'Neil, and Mr. Carter with chit-chat while their attending doctors got into position. Once I could see the tops of their heads peeking from the hallway, I knew it was time to get the show on the road.  I promised I'd retrieve the missing ring as soon as I finished with John Doe 901-8A's autopsy. Waiting for the students to consider their options, I assembled my tools. I knew one of them was going to offer to help: young doctors are notorious for taking advantage of any opportunity to get their hands dirty and to show off. It was Miss Jackson who did as expected, and proposed they assist me. I played dumb, pretended that I was surprised and very relieved to get their help, and motioned towards the box of latex gloves on the counter. In order to keep the students from getting suspicious, I began with simple and normal requests: handing me my scalpel, removing the corpse's shoes and socks, and filling out part of a mandatory autopsy form. All the while, I performed a Y incision on the mans chest to get to his organs. The fun part happened once I felt the students were sufficiently comfortable with my authority. I was going to convince them theyd be hearing a dead mans final breath.  At first, everything went off as it normally would: I explained that I was going to remove oxygen from John Doe's lungs by pressing on them, and if they listened carefully, they could hear it as it made its way up his throat and out his mouth. I didn't put any pressure on them to do so, mind you. It had to be voluntary: I'm not a monster, after all. To my great delight, they all enthusiastically agreed to listen to the biological phenomenon. Now, normally I had enough time to set up an air nozzle near the corpses head, which I would use to send out a gust of air towards the intended victims. It usually startled the living daylights out of them. This time; however, I didn't have the luxury of properly setting up the prank, so I decided Id go with a cheap "BOO!" jump scare instead. The result would likely be the same.   "Come closer.", I requested, pointing to my patients face.  Once the students were in position, I asked Mr. O'Neil to open John Doe's mouth. He hesitantly placed his hands on the wrinkly old man's face, pulling his lower jaw down to reveal a nasty set of rotten black teeth. Mr. Carter gagged at the sight, but the other two kept their cool. I must say, I was impressed by how well they kept their composure throughout the examination. Stifling a laugh, I reached a hand inside the corpse's chest in preparation. The smell emanating from John Does mouth was far from pleasant, but it was nothing I wasn't used to. Now, we were all in place: the residents were crouched down with their faces inches from the mans, and mine was about a foot farther away.  "Okay, listen carefully.", I said calmly, squeezing the exposed lung.  A heavy puff of air unexpectedly escaped the man's blueish lips. It was foggy, like a winters breath. The four of us gasped in shock, inadvertently inhaling the fumes. I could feel the sickeningly moist and cold air fingering its way down my throat and into my lungs, leaving the taste of rotten eggs on my tongue. Wiping my mouth, I retracted and gagged in disgust. The attending doctors laughed and clapped behind the glass separator. They had no idea our little prank had gone awry. The freaked-out students looked nauseous, coughing repeatedly as they turned towards the hallway full of doctors. When they realized they'd been hazed, they calmed down. Not wanting to lose face in front of my colleagues, I regained my composure, forced a chuckle, and claimed Id used dry ice to manage the effect.   The doctors and students never suspected a thing, but I knew the truth: wed stolen a dead mans final breath. I nervously finished the autopsy, the disgusting taste lingering in my mouth. Aside from the puff of cold air that had escaped the man's lips, there was nothing out of the ordinary with my patient, yet there was something about him that put me on edge. Unfortunately, my childish actions had already sealed our fates, and things were about to take a drastic turn for the worst.  ***  My alarm went off, waking me for the first time in years and leaving me in a momentary daze. Usually, I was up a dozen minutes ahead of time. I sat in bed, running a hand over my sore neck. My throat ached, as though I was coming down with the flu, yet the rest of my body was perfectly fine. Although I had brushed my teeth thoroughly several times since the incident in the morgue, I could still make out the aftertaste of rot in the back of my mouth. The subtle flavor was enough to convince me to use the god-awful mouthwash I'd purchased a few months ago. The powerful, alcohol-imbued liquid stung my mouth, but succeeded in diminishing the unpleasant taste.  I drove to work, picking up a cup of coffee along the way. The unpleasant egg-like taste made drinking it almost unbearable, but I needed the caffeine to wake me up. As the rest of the world prepared for a pleasant evening at home, I had mountains of paperwork and several autopsies to look forward to. The beauty of working the night shift was that I rarely got interrupted when I needed to focus. When I arrived at the morgue, my fellow medical examiner gave me a helpful status update, and left me to my own devices. There was a body waiting for examination in cooling unit 5. According to my colleagues' notes, an invasive autopsy would not be necessary.  I opened the cooler, slid the body out, placed it on a gurney, and brought it under a bright neon light for proper examination. There was an annoying hissing noise in the room, so I turned on the radio, and took a seat on a rolling stool in front of my patient. When you see one corpse, you've seen them all. It's hard to be shocked by what lies inside the body bag. That said, when I saw her frozen and pale face, I felt a slight twinge in my chest. You never expect to see someone you know come across your table. Yet, there she was, the young lady I'd pranked the night before. Her skin had taken on a blue sheen. Bruising around her neck revealed that she'd suffocated. The markings were not indicative of human hands, so I checked her file for an explanation. Apparently, Miss Rene Jackson's scarf had gotten stuck in a rotating door. A group of good Samaritans tried to help, but as they pulled the door, the scarf tightened around her neck. By the time they got the poor woman free, she was gone.  It doesn't matter how long you work in the business, the loss of a life always leaves a bitter taste in your mouth. No, not like the taste of rotten eggs from a homeless man's final breath: a metaphorical bad taste. I certainly felt bad for the young lady, but at that moment, I had no idea her death was my fault. It just seemed like an unfortunate accident. When I slipped her back into her cooling unit for pick-up by the funeral home, I made a conscious effort to erase her from my thoughts, and moved to the next corpse on the list.  Later, as I was filing paperwork, the radio started playing god-awful pop music, so I turned it off to keep my ears from melting. My throat was still quite sore, and no amount of water could moisten the walls of my oesophagus. I was just about to leave and get something to eat when I heard the faint hissing coming from the cooling units. I hoped none of the compressors were going on the fritz again. Last time one of them burnt out, we were forced to pair up bodies in the remaining units. It made me uncomfortable to do so, since it could be seen as a lack of respect for the dead, but the alternative was to let them warm up and rot. If I were a family member, I would much prefer seeing my loved one well-preserved rather than decomposed, even if that meant they were spooning another body for a few hours. I made my way to the cooling units, focusing on the rhythmic sound. It was coming from unit 5. It sounded like a repeated cycle of compression and decompression. I opened the pod, touched a hand to the wall, and confirmed that it was still cold. As long as the refrigeration was still working, I saw no reason to make a fuss. I left a note for maintenance to check it out and took a much overdue lunch break.  The combination of a sore throat and the bad taste in my mouth made it hard for me to eat, so I threw out my lunch after a few bites, and spent the rest of my time off wandering the corridors. Once I returned to the office, I was pleasantly surprised that my note to maintenance was gone, and that the noise had stopped. Maintenance rarely acted so quickly, unless it was an emergency.  It wasn't long before my shift was over, and I was relieved of my duties. By then, the sun was rising and the sky was as pink as the small intestine of a freshly-cut corpse. On my way home, I stopped by the pharmacy to buy cough drops in the hopes that the vile-tasting things would ease my aching throat. I did not even hesitate to pop three in my mouth at once, swallowing the numbing mixture of medicine and saliva for some short-lived relief. When I arrived at my modest town house, I placed my phone on the kitchen counter, and took a seat in the living room to watch TV. My phone began buzzing, but nothing was getting me off that couch. The buzzing persisted for quite some time, but my ability to ignore it was boundless. Very few people knew my number, so it had to be work. There was no way in hell I was answering while off-duty. Before long, I was comfortably nestled under my blanket and ready to doze off.   When I awoke, I practically had to gasp to get air into my lungs. My airway felt tight and constricted. I immediately threw a handful of cough drops into my mouth to ease the pain and try to reduce inflammation. I rushed to the shower, enjoying the soothing steamy air for longer than normal, while I waited for the pain to subside. Choosing whether or not to call in sick was particularly difficult: my throat was the only thing causing me grief, and I was almost out of sick days, since Id used most nursing a chronic case of "the Mondays". Not wanting to waste a sick day on actually being ill, I ultimately decided to go to work. On my way out, I checked my messages, and saw that my coworker had discovered one of the cooling unit doors wide open. The units were old, so I wasn't particularly surprised to hear that a latch had malfunctioned.  When I arrived for the shift change, my colleague droned on and on about how the city funeral home had not yet picked up the day's shipment of bodies. I promised Id take care of things. After my coworker left, I took a look at the list of acquisitions. There was a new body waiting for me in cooling unit 8. As I pulled it out, I was confronted with the second fatality of my doing. It was Brandon ONeil, though I barely recognized him. For one familiar face to appear on my table was odd. For a second acquaintance to make it there? It was unheard of. A chill ran down my spine, and I couldnt help wondering what was going on. I had to get to the bottom of itand fast.  ***  Brandon ONeil, the med student I had met barely two days ago, lay swollen on the coroner table. His face was puffy and barely recognizable. In fact, I only knew who it was thanks to his medical chart. He was the second casualty in what ended up to be a tragedy entirely of my doing. I examined him thoroughly for any sign of foul-play, suspecting the third med student, Mr. Adrien Carter, was trying to get rid of the competition. There had to be a reason his fellow students had died barely a day apart.  Despite my best efforts to find clues, Mr. O'Neil's autopsy revealed nothing suspicious. The young man died of anaphylactic shock, an allergic reaction that caused his airway to constrict. I found several pieces of ground-up peanuts lodged in his swollen throat. According to his file, he'd been eating at a Thai restaurant and had failed to notice the nuts in his stir fry. Unfortunate? Yes. Preventable? Absolutely. Suspicious? Definitely not. I swallowed hard, the taste of sweaty socks and sulfur still at the forefront of my mouth.   Following procedure, I completed Mr. ONeils autopsy, placed the young man back in his cooling unit, and set up to write my report. A familiar sound caught my attention as I sat down to focus. The cooling units were hissing again. This time, I could hear not one, but two distinct sources. What were the odds that two compressors were malfunctioning at the same time? My investigation ended before it even began, when my office phone started ringing. Startled by the sound, I nearly fell off my chair. It was Ted from the funeral home, apologizing about failing to pick-up last night's shipment. The funeral home was backed up and wouldn't be able to come by for another 36 hours. It was certainly not ideal, but it happened from time to time, and I was confident we had enough functioning cooling units to make due.  I went back to work, trying my hardest to ignore the pain in my throat and the sound of the cooling units compressing and decompressing incessantly. Without realizing it, I found myself breathing along to the same tempo. As the sound began to slow, so too did the speed of my breathing. I'm not sure what would have happened, had Doctor Chang not appeared at that moment. I suspect that, had the sound stopped entirely, I might have forgotten to breathe. Thankfully, it didn't come to that, and Chang broke me out of my trance by storming into my office.  A smile on my face, I greeted doctor Chang courteously. He and I had a sort of childish camaraderie, wherein we frequently pulled pranks both together and against one another. His gloom-ridden features told me that his visit was not going to be a pleasant one. He was, as one would expect, quite distraught about the deaths of his two residents. In lieu of comforting him---something I was not particularly adept at, I answered his questions regarding his students, and shared my findings with him. Since the autopsies had revealed nothing suspicious, there wasnt much to tell. Doctor Chang, in turn, confided in me something quite disturbing: the third medical student, Mr. Carter, had not shown up for his shift. Intending to lighten the mood, I assured Doctor Chang that his student was not among the corpses in my morgue. Little did I know, he soon would be.  After Doctor Chang left, I went back to work, updating my dossiers. As I took a stroll towards the filing cabinet near the cooling units, I began hearing that noise again. I immediately called maintenance, claiming there was an emergency. They arrived promptly and performed a thorough inspection. When they approached me, waiting outside in the hallway, they warned me that cooling units 5 and 8 had been opened. They theorized that Id heard the sound of air escaping the capsules. I; however, was certain Id closed the doors properly this time. I began feeling quite nervous as the men left the room. Almost as soon as they were out of sight, the sounds started again. I ran to the cooling units, and pushed against their doors: they were sealed shut. The sounds, I realized, were like that of someone breathing. Were Rene and Brandons bodies somehow breathing inside of the vacuum-sealed chambers? The hairs on the back of my neck and arms rose, and I took a step back. From the corner of my eyes, I saw cooling unit 5s door slowly swing open.  "SON OF A BITCH!!!", I screamed, my voice strong despite the stinging pain in my throat.  Though I tried to convince myself it was all just my imagination, triggered by misplaced guilt from the deaths of people I knew, I am not afraid to admit that I ran out of the morgue with my tail between my legs. I did not speak to a soul, bolting straight for the washroom to splash cold water onto my face. Who on earth would be dumb enough to believe me anyway? Corpses dont breathe, and they certainly cant open doors. I took a deep breath, but as the air reached the back of my mouth, I felt a severely unpleasant sensation. Pulling my cheeks away, I looked into my mouth, and nearly screamed: my molars had turned black and rotten, my throat resembled a warning label on a pack of cigarettes, and my tongue was almost grey. The nauseating scent of decomposition trickled out of my mouth and into my nose, making my eyes water. Maybe what I heard from the bodies was my imagination, but the physical changes in me were quite real.  On my way back to the morgue, I picked up a few heavy-duty locks from the janitors closet. It was just for my own peace of mind. Using the locks, I secured the cooling units. If nothing else, the doors wouldnt accidentally open anymore.  Every single inhale and exhale brought with it a searing pain, as well as a strong sulfuric taste. I was getting really sick of the horrid flavor. In the cold and deserted morgue, I paced back and forth, trying to snuff out every horrible theory coming to the forefront of my mind. Was it cancer? Had I been poisoned? Was I going insane? I was so lost in my thoughts that I failed to notice the new corpse waiting for me on the operating table, until a movement caught my eye. I saw its chest rise. It was subtle, but I was sure of it. Was Doctor Chang playing a cruel joke? No, I hadnt told anyone about my fears: how could he have known? I approached the body hesitantly. As my heart throbbed desperately against the walls of my chest, I pulled back the white sheet that was draped over his body.  There, on my table, lay Adrien Carter, the last of the med students. My legs felt weak as I watched his corpse in disbelief. One death? Unfortunate. Two deaths? Suspicious. THREE deaths? There was no way to rationalize how three medical residents had perished, all within the span of a few days. My trembling fingers took hold of Mr. Carters chart, and my eyes darted through it, reading only the keywords: depression, stress, suicide, hanging. His family thought he'd done himself in because med school had proven to be too stressful. It wasn't unusual for residents to get a little depressed, and I could almost buy the story, if not for one crucial detail: the look on Adrien's face. His eyes and muscles were twisted in absolute terror. It wasn't the look of pain and regret you sometimes see when people hang themselves. It wasn't the peaceful acceptance of one's fate. No, it was a look of primal fear that I had never seen on anyone before. An emotion so raw that I could practically feel it by proxy. It sent chills down my spine, and I had to throw a sheet over his face to be able to continue my work, though I wish I hadn't.  The sheet moved. I screamed, but my throat was so tight that the sound could barely make it through.  Quickly, without even completing the autopsy, I rolled Adrien's body into one of the cooling units, and locked him in there. I could hear all three of them breathing from the other side. They were breathing a dead man's final breath. A breath we had stolen. It was all my fault. I had done this to them. I had killed each and every one of those young medical students, all for a cheap laugh. Their blood was on my hands. I had cursed them. I had cursed myself. They continued breathing, even as I ran out of the room. I could hear the echoes of their deep exhales as I frantically ran to my car and drove home, breaking the speed limit. What did it matter if I was arrested? I was going to die soon, anyways.  So here I am, writing this to you. Consider this a mea culpa, if you will. Though not directly by my hands, I caused the deaths of three young medical students, and have cursed myself to the same fate. I'm afraid I'm not long for this world: I can feel a lump in my throat now. My autopsy will probably reveal a tumor of some sort. I could keep quiet, I could preserve my legacybut for my own peace of mind, I couldnt leave without revealing the truth. I am sorry. To the loving families of Rene Jackson, Brandon O'Neil, and Adrien Carter: I am so terribly, terribly sorry.
I had a ton of weird stuff happen to me in a house I used to live in. I once GENUINELY believed a burglar broke in, only to investigate and find the house empty. The place was creepy from the get-go, what with the previous tenants having left overnight without telling anyone, and the poems of suicide written in crayon in what ended up being my room. I mean, this sounds like some kind of horror movie BS, but I'm being dead serious. I'd see figures sometimes, too. And I don't mean small apparitions caught in the corner of my vision. I mean full-blown figures, while I was 100% concious, and that I could follow into other rooms before they disappeared.   It wasn't even that old of a house. Maybe 35-45 years old when we rented it.   My theory was either a brain tumor, or some kind of electromagnetic field seriously messing with my head, 'cause my parents and sister never saw anything. My friends; however, said they could 'feel' things---even before I ever mentioned weird stuff going down.
xD
Duuudeeee, I LOVE it! :D!!
Well, fiddlesticks and fudgesicles!
Is 150 000$ too steep?
Look at that adorable little guy! He thinks his arm is a gun!  Want to see the absolute BEST marine creature? Google red lipped batfish. Can you say sexy?
First offouch.  Doesn't matter how it happened, though. I'm making you my honorary brother. We people-with-crooked-fingers have to stick together!
Yay team! I've got a question for you, 'Capt. This is my first round of NoSleep Teams. I read the Wiki, but I'm still a *tiny* bit confused. How do we know when it's our turn..? (P.S. I am on your team, fearless leader!)
Oh, man. That sounds awesome...and horrific. I definitely want to read it when it's done.
GASP! I'll just have to douse myself in salt.   Edit: Wait, no. I'm not the one doing the ritual. What do I care about protecting myself against slug demons?
The tip of one of my fingers is slightly crooked (thanks a lot, dad's genes). So, naturally, people IRL call me a heathen and a monster, and it's only normal for me to go out and try to eat them at night. I would therefore not mind it if my kind are portrayed that way.  In all seriousness, though. If the reader can't tell the difference between the opinions of your CHARACTERS versus YOUR opinions, then there's something wrong with THEM.
: D
I'd say maybe 5 solid deaths and about 5-6 mushier ones. I meaninsinuated deaths.
That chameleon is great, and that stamp is awesome!  My sister got me an alarm clock that imitates the sunrise. It's pretty dark in my room, so this'll make mornings a lot more cheerful. My current alarm clock is so old it actually has a cassette tape player integrated into it.  My parental units got me a bunch of cool stuff for my kitchen (including a potato ricer) and some DCU movies. Can't wait to watch Justice League: War with my sister. Never too old for Justice League!
I don't think so. I saw a photo of her a little while ago. There's definitely a family resemblance.
