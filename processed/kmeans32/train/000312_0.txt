I know, unfortunately the GOP has run a successful union busting ring here for the past 50 years. The regional airlines here are separate companies that use non union pilots and are contracted out by the big 3 airlines (Delta, United, and American) to fly smaller planes ([40 to 80 seat planes like this](http://www.flugzeuginfo.net/acimages/crj700er_kp.jpg)) from their hubs to small cities, think Chicago to Green Bay. They are staffed by pilots just out of flight school so they are desperate to get their "dream job" and go to work for regional airlines because the larger ones won't hire you out of flight school. The regional airlines know that they don't have to pay a high salary because there are plenty of eager pilots in line to get a job. In a perfect world you spend a few years flying for a regional airline then get hired by the Delta's, United's, Southwest's and JetBlue's of the world. But that doesn't always happen.

It doesn't need to be banned. It just shouldn't be flown on the lawn of the South Carolina legislature. There is too much baggage associated with the flag. If you think it's "southern pride" then fly it on your own property. That flag was flown by traitors who rebelled against the US government. No state should embrace that flag   [(this applies to Mississippi as well)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Mississippi)  Note: Born and raised in Georgia and always associated that flag with racism.   edit: spelling and grammar.

Well that isn't because of a tax cut, is it? I mean, can you show me how LA tax cuts have cratered the world wide price of oil? If not, then placing all the blame on taxes is just silly.  Of course falling oil prices aren't because of taxes. The point is that Jindal was banking on high oil prices to help the state out of the huge hole they put themselves in and didn't have a plan B just in case.   Again, raising taxes is only one option/tool there. The other option/tool is to address the spending that has increased $2B from 2012 to 2014.The fact that they choose not to question the spending side of the equation doesn't mean that it doesn't exist or that it is automatically all because of less taxes.Call me crazy, but I doubt that the tax increases somehow magically caused spending to rise by $2B in 2 years, but I'm happy to look at what you've got.  First this statement doesn't make any sense to me. The state is in a $1.6B budget gap, you don't get that way by just increasing spending you get that way by cutting revenue as well. You can't get out of this mess by just cutting everything, you need to raise revenue as well. If you cut everything you end up with shitty road, schools, government services etc. You keep sighting this $2B and yet I can find that figure in the document you provided in another comment (could you at least cite a page or pages, I don't have time to read a 120pg document). Also how could tax increases cause spending to rise? More to the point they didn't raise taxes at all, they cut them or let them stay as is. This contributed to the mess they are in.

You say in /r/logcabinrepublicans that you were an active part in /r/conservative. That right there made me lose any respect that I had for you. You can certainly have views about fiscal policy and what not but that place is a hell hole of racist homophobic conspiratory right wing fundamentalist shit. The fact of the matter is that the republican party HATES us and our existence. Look at their presidential candidates. Everyone of them is against LGBT rights and supported the Indiana law

There is nothing stoping Cobb or Gwinnett from entering MARTA and "differences " between the counties can easily be resolved. CCT and GCT are just bus service. Its easy for MARTA to come in and simply  replace it. Public transportation is universal, there is nothing that makes it special. It's bus and rail, that's it. CCT and GCT are not special. Funding might be a little different but again nothing stoping Cobb and Gwinnett from joining MARTA. Also the best public transportation systems are large ones that serve the whole region, not a peace meal of regional ones. Looks at the systems in San Francisco, Botson, and Washington dc. They work because they are one system where everyone contributes and everyone benefits.
I don't give two shits about the color of this fucking ugly dress. Though I will tip my hat to the genius how posted this first and is probably laughing their ass off.
I haven't cared about this story since day one. The man is a human being, their are many instances of a persons memories being incorrect do to the fog of the incident, or just random crap that happens as time goes by. Heck some Holocaust survivor stories have turned out not to be true. So I don't blame Brian one bit and think that he is being shat on way too much. He is the best among the evening news anchors and I will continue to watch him.
Today 5 more counties started offering gay marriage licenses after not doing so yesterday.   Also it sounds like the governor has a sound head on his shoulders (never thought I would say that of an Alabama politician).  It is important for people across the country to know that the governor of Alabama today is not the governor of Alabama 50 years ago.   **and**  I dont want Alabama to be seen as it was 50 years ago when a federal law was defied. Im not going to do that, Im trying to move this state forward.  Of note: It is the 50th anniversary of the March on Selma in about 3 weeks, I think this is fresh on his and other Alabamans minds right now.
yes I know it's a christian site but I wanted to share the bigotry/crazy  edit: For those that don't want to give the site clicks the headline is all you really need, also he said this on his facebook page so this is not an "official" order yet. It should also be noted the the governor said yesterday that he would not seek charges against judges who issue marriage licenses to gay couples. So once again Moore is alone in this fight.   Edit2: apparently the article has been taken down  Edit 3: [Here is a cache of the original link](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache%3Achristiannews.net%2F2015%2F02%2F09%2Falabama-chief-justice-charges-will-be-filed-against-judges-who-issued-gay-marriage-licenses%2F oq=cache%3Achristiannews.net%2F2015%2F02%2F09%2Falabama-chief-justice-charges-will-be-filed-against-judges-who-issued-gay-marriage-licenses%2F)
I don't think it was an entirely bad idea, it may have just been poor execution (pardon the pun). I think the idea is that instead of promoting their product they are promoting household safety, like the Always commercial isn't promoting their product but treating women with dignity and not ostracizing women/girls.

it helps for me that I go to a small school (like 2100) so its kinda hard to not make friends over time becauase you know everyone. We don't hang out that much, maybe once or twice a month, and most of my "social" activity is with my roommate (who I actually like which is good). The most activity that I do with my friends is have lunch. So I'm still kinda a "shut in" but I am more active now.
How about she loves me unconditionally. No matter what happens she is always there to cheer me up.
A FUCKING MEN, seriously read intire post that he is talking [about](http://onwardstate.com/2015/01/18/ad-sandy-barbour-apologies-for-409-helmet-stickers/). PSU fans are fucking insane. They ones on here keep claiming that it's only a minority that are JoePa apologists. If that's the fact SPEAK UP and let your voices be heard because if you don't your school is going to forever be associated with child rape and cult apologists. As an added bonus listen to the PSU hockey coach jump through hopes to try and defend the 409 stickers in a radio [interview](http://www.tsn.ca/radio/toronto-1050/gadowski-students-chose-to-wore-decals-1.186437)
