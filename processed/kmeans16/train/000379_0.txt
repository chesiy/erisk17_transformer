...HERE COMES THE MONEY! !!!!!!
...is Carmen SanDiego!  Sorry I couldn't help myself.  Probably lying on the side of the ring or made his way to the back.  You'd run too if you got hit with the Taker lights.

Reigns was, Kevin Dunn was, Michael Cole was, JBL was... it is the flavor of the week
Not just the stories, but his actual matches too.  Same formula.  Show up, gyrate and slick hair back, point to self getting in ring, slight offense, get ass kicked, oversell, comeback (clotheslines, corner splash, neckbreaker, yeahhhhh!) more ass kicking, occasional Zig Zag outta nowhere, get hit with finisher and oversell).  I'm not saying he is horrible, just boring and predictable (same could be said about others, i.e. Orton, Sheamus, etc).  HE could be used better somewhere else like GFW or ROH or NJPW, although he would make far less.
Perry Saturn and Moppy
I'd like to see [Ayako Hamada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayako_Hamada) but with the TNA past who knows.  WWE does seem to be lessening the blocking of ex-TNA talent so this could happen.
That's on me!    So great lol
It's is sad that people are getting this offended by one segment, yet have said nothing for years, despite this same type of thing occurring multiple times.  So sad.
You're an idiot... they are putting these guys in competitive matches with cena that showcase them and that they can hang with the top guy in the company.  You don't have to lose to someone to put them over.  Yes it can be done that way but it's not the only way.  But I don't expect you to take anything anyone says as legit unless they 100% agree with what you are saying so I guess I am wasting my time on a lost cause that is you.
I knew, when this happened, that it wouldn't be long till someone did a Brazzers meme/gif/picture of it.  Very good stuff there
The curbstomp in theory is a good move... it just rarely if ever looks good when he hits it.  The set up is never believable in that his opponents would never irl just sit in that position long enough for him to set up and hit it.
Eh... not so much lol
That was my favorite part.  All this commotion going on and Ambrose is just off in his own world doing his thing moving thje table and chairs.  Then they all just look at him and he is like "What?"  That is the Ambrose that is so great.
I like where this is going...however it felt very awkward and rushed.
