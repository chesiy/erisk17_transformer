Looks like a steak and a side of mashed potatoes.
Same here. We had a rough week. The roughest I've ever seen. The franchisee of the store I work at extended the fifty off until tomorrow...
Thanks so much! That's the one.
Either of the following: 1. The smell of bleach on my hands no matter how hard I scrub 2. Stickiness 3. The sensation of wearing wet socks all the time 4. Standing in line for something I can't go on without 5. Driving in heavy traffic when I'm already late
This sounds like my kind of drinking buddies. Can't get that around here.

I don't wanna pick a best. I'll list a few favorites.  Disclaimer: these are my own opinions. They do not make me right nor do they make me wrong.  1. Scrubs - it outlines the base idea of the show. No one can work in such an environment on their own. No one should try to be "superman" and do everything themselves. 2. Ground floor - it's just really fun and that's what the show is. 3. Breaking Bad - it's very mysterious and tense while also mellow. It also has a desert feel to it, which is logical  since that's where it mainly takes place. I don't think anyone could have picked a better theme song for the show.
Anna Gunn. Why the fuck not?
I wrote a comment about this once before. I don't feel like retrieving it so either you can accept that or go look at my comments.
I agree with you on that. That's fact for a lot of things. If you pay $5 for x item and replace it 3 times a year. You just spent $15 plus tax and the gas to make multiple trips to the store or shipping fees on the internet on the "cheaper" product. If you go ahead and buy the $20 version of the same product, you'll save more on the long run. I spend more on my tv, computer, hdmi cables, car parts, etc because they'll last significantly longer and usually have protection plans.
Lol that's what I meant.
I love Jimmy eat world. That song does it for me too. If you know the background behind it, it's even more sad.
When I still lived at home, I was allowed to stay as long as I needed but my parents (dad and step mom) had to be able to view my bank account at any given time. This was not a problem since I don't buy much anyway. My problem was the confusion in this rule. My dad said "You shouldn't just go to work, come home, go to work come home and so on. Anyone who works should reward himself every payday with a little something. Even just a cola on the way home from work." Which I did... then my step mom, within minutes of the purchase, would call my cell phone and bitch me out her : "What did you buy just now?" Me: "I stopped and got a soda for a dollar twenty five" her: " You're supposed to be saving so you can move out!" Me: "I suppose a dollar and a quarter will prevent that huh?" Her: "that's not the point, you need to save everything! You'll never make it on your own if you don't learn to manage your money!" Me: "so a dollar twenty five per week on myself is poor management? Hmm, then with that logic, I'm not as bad as you and dad right? Because a hundred dollars every other week going out to eat has to be worse financially" her: "Don't let it happen again!" Call ends. It was like having two different bosses. Ridiculous bullshit.
I've got a better one than my last. I'd be wearing nothing but a tattoo and a smile. Drive like 50 mph over the limit and when a cop pulls me over, just sit completely still and quiet. When he goes to his car to call for backup just climb to the back seat and lay in the floor incase he comes back and tries to reach in the driver's seat. When backup arrives, if they open the doors to search, just slowly climb out of the vehicle like nothing's going on. FUCK THE POLICE!
Go to sonic drive in. Order the bacon double cheese burger (number 3 here) add bbq sauce chilli and slaw. I order without mayo because I don't like mayo. This burger is the messiest burger I've ever sunk my teeth into and so very tasty. I'm slobbering on my pillow thinking about it.
I'd buy $100m worth of bacon and burn it on live cam and upload it all over the net.
