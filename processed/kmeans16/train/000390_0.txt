I usually read in well lit areas. Today, for example, I read at work during lunch at about 1130...started falling asleep.   As for a more interesting book, any suggestion for someone who used to read a lot of fiction stuff?
There isn't any save data in the cloud since this particular PS account doesn't have Plus; another user on the console has it.
Thanks for the info. We don't have any assets together. We have only purchased small things that, to me, are inconsequential. There is a child involved however. She's three and I was there when she was born and have raised her since yet she is not biologically mine. My name is even on her birth certificate so I fear this could complicate things a bit.

Guess I'll have to quit my job.
Thanks. Going to have to try that next time.
How did the bags get like that?
Attempted Month 2 Day 1 last night. I think I need some motivation.   Last night I attempted to start Month 2 Day 1. I got through the fit test just fine. However, I found that I could not complete the Max Interval Circuit. I got about halfway through and physically could not do it. Maybe I'm being too hard on myself but that was a real blow to my confidence in terms of this workout.  I really enjoy this workout. I love the potential results I could get.  To anyone else here, how did you stay motivated to keep going when it got tough and when you felt like you couldn't do it anymore?
So, this is my wife's ankle...no idea what's going on. Any idea?
My wife and I love that so, here, have an upvote.
What motivated you to write the song Hesitate? Where were you at the time, psychologically speaking?
Not lame. I laughed.
