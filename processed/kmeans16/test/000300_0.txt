full annie gameplay B3 commentated by a silver player.
actually i think its every skin but infernal because he has a different laugh and taunt than his normal
litterally just dont think about it to much the worse thing you can do to yourself in ranked is to get anxious. i know it will be hard to not get anxious i still do around promos but if you can handle it you will be in full concentration.  Tips  * look at enemy champions and try to remember all their abilities and how they synergize in team fights in comparison to yours.  * think about how much more experience you have with certain champs whether they are supports or carries.  * before reaching the lane try to think of a good build for the game if you are playing a diverse champion.  these are just things i have done to calm down in all my games other things i do is verbally talk out loud about what i do works alot for me.
i have a friend that uses macros for laughing and walking at the same time so hes never not laughing when hes moving and it can either keep you the same speed or some cases speed you up. its rare that it will speed you up i would check into that used to main singed myself so i know the feel.
alright missions your best bet is this page here. http://www.naruto-boards.com/953198/ its gotten me around 10 characters. now for climbing you need to look into all the old characters there have been some major changes. EX lee no longer has 2 different builds its now 2 different characters. kin no longer infinitely stacks damage on people she now has conditional skills on skill targeting. and ten ten no longer deals over time aoe she can now stack damage and reduce damage that target deals in an aoe fashion but once a turn. another thing is that chouji no longer deals 300% on his 3rd pill its now a flat damage for his skils ranging from 20+ on his hand one (cant remember name) and 10+ on his roll invuln the invulnerability on it doesnt block healing so you can take sakura S on chouji team and heal him when hes invuln while eating a pill. thats going to be all i can really tell you i really reccomend looking into all characters with this http://nahelp.webs.com/Nahelper.swf
your sorta supposed to die with a team around. that way your first death will only put you in a better position for a team fight.
i wish i knew a little more about scripts but from this video i can tell that some of these plays were predictable with vision but i am going to watch the replay to see his vision only i want to say possibly dodge script but maybe not viktor skill script atm.
well during the game when did you use your E perhaps a bug happened that you managed to set up.
would love to see warring kingdom jarvan.
the carry, the Carries carry  i actually like that i hope that isnt taken for you 2 but basically the carries carry is the support in how they carry
im suprised that hasnt been used yet for vi. she has been around for atleast 2 Chinese new years.
thank you i love how you put chess in there it really puts it more in perspective for me with that analogy. i will be sure to take all of this information to heart thank you so much.
KHA KHA it's Kha'zix
