Was David Cross (Tobias Funke) in the unreleased Fantastic Four movie from 1994?   https://youtu.be/AbK6CUB4MJs   The movie is on the above link, the character I think is David Cross comes in at about 42:15. IMDB and Wikipedia have no mention of the character on either Cross' page or the movie's.   It makes sense for it to be him; 1994 is when he was just beginning his career and they casted the cheapest actors they could. Also, he seems like the kind of guy who would enjoy making fun of his own mistakes, as they did in season 4 of Arrested Development. Thoughts? Can anyone find proof of who this actor is?

I'm Haitian.   It is absolutely true that Haitians will ruin your garage sale. I have seen multiple occasions of Haitian people coming to a garage sale with a box, collecting $50+ worth of stuff in it then setting it in front of you and saying "5 dollars?" And if you say no, they just leave everything there. I think it's fucking hilarious that people do that but yeah it's annoying if you're the one having the garage sale.
Absolutely dude I'm so fucked, like bent over the table with a meterstick in my ass and a multimeter hooked up to my nipples fucked.

I might not be remembering exactly right but I believe Robb said something about how he didn't think Karstark would stay at the Wall of he was sent there. Because Karhold is so close, his allies would have just rescued him and taken him back home.

After a stressful week I finally got to sleep in. Got 12 hours and now I feel great and ready to tackle it all again.
Can't tell if it's the baby disappearing because of abortion or the dad disappearing because of the stereotype.
