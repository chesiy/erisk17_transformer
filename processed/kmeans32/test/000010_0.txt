My feeling is that it's a kind of hypercorrection. Like, teachers tell you not to say "me and him," but instead "he and I," so some people have a tendency to say "he and I" even when it's wrong.  In American English we tend to soften words with T's in them: butter become budder, metal becomes medal. So some people are hypercorrecting all T words to into D words even though that's not how Americans typically pronounce those words.  I've heard it in the New York metro area. I don't know if this is a country-wide thing.
One is not allowed to undergo any intentionally sterilizing surgery or procedure, including SRS and hormone replacement.  Many trans people don't undergo surgery and hormones don't necessarily make you sterile. There was that transman that had a baby for pete's sake.   To me, if you're having a baby, you're not a man. You just can't have it both ways.
There is no logic behind it. It's just a cultural fad. Here's a portrait of a man with long hair from the mid-17th century: http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/illustration/man-with-black-bows-by-sebastien-bourdon-oil-on-canvas-stock-graphic/149319874
You're right that it amounted to an occupation, but when you use that word, people who don't understand the situation probably imagine it's like Red Dawn -- the commies marching in and taking over because, well, that's what commies do! Or even like the US using WMD as an excuse to march into Iraq and topple its dictator because oil, duh.   What was missing from moussa's posts is the context of what happened. Lebanon had been involved in a civil war for a while before Israel got involved, not to mention the fact that Syria also was occupying the country.   It was a very complicated situation and boiling it down to "it's all Israel's fault" is simply untrue and upvoting what he wrote is a demonstration of biased ignorance.
Thanks.
When you're watching your weight, thinking any food is "the devil" tends to be counterproductive because it makes it even more tempting.   But she is right that soda is bad for you just like any other high-sugar, low-nutrition food is. It not only contributes to weight gain but tooth decay when consumed excessively or as part of a general poor-quality diet.

That has little to do with it. There are areas in NYC that are becoming gentrified and it is pushing people out despite whatever rent control/stabilized apartments they may have for a number of reasons:  - It changes the character of the neighborhood. If enough of your neighbors are now white transplants from Oklahoma and not the folks you've lived with all your life, you're not going to feel comfortable there anymore and you're going to move out. Just like there's white flight, there's black flight.  - People moving in start opening fancier and more expensive stores that push out whatever cheaper stores that were there before which both reduces the number of "normal" stores in the area and makes them more expensive to shop at because the owners can now charge higher rents.  - Greedy landlords who own a lot of buildings in the neighborhood try to get people to move legally (offering them money to leave) or illegally (harassment of various sorts).
Hamotzei meichaveiro, alav harayah.  Great phrase. Never heard it before, which surprises me since it's a very useful phrase for the kind of people that I hang around with.
Try /r/literature then.
Not really correct. There were some well-known rich Jewish families and there were certainly some well-off Jewish communities, but overall, the majority of Jews throughout history were poor.   This kind of conspiracy theory that OP is talking about really only goes back to the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, which was first published in 1903. Previous to that, the sort of conspiracy theories about Jews was that they were poisoning wells and using the blood of Christian children in their matzah, not that they were taking over the world.
Baccano was better.
We will always enter and search to be sure that nobody was home, putting us at risk with their stupid decisions.  And I didn't know that. Will mention it next time the subject comes up.  Meanwhile it's not uncommon for bad fires to spread to neighboring houses  Not everybody lives in such close proximity to others so this isn't always applicable.
Yes, you're right I ignored some parts of your post and I don't find your saying so abrasive, it's just that I'm caught up with this same thing with someone who's in the place of your coworker and it's so hard to have to basically just stand around and watch them suffer because of a bad decision they made 20 years ago and have been compounding ever since.
I don't know what your circumstances are or what your goals are, but your coworker is 100% correct that it's easier to go back to school when you're younger than when you're older, and if you wait to until you "know what you want to do," you might be waiting until you're dead because not everybody figures out what they want. Besides, going to college can help you figure out what you want because there's a variety of classes you wouldn't have an opportunity to take otherwise and professors and advisers that you wouldn't be able to interact with otherwise.

Maybe I'm not writing with a burning passion but I don't think most professional writers are. They always say that you're not supposed to wait for inspiration, you're supposed to set a schedule and stick to it.  I can't do both. I can write in an inspired way but inspiration isn't going to sustain a novel-length work. Or I can write a novel methodically and apparently not have any heart.
I don't know what goes through their minds, never having done it, but I'd rather someone speak up and then have to apologize if they've made a mistake rather than letting people getting away with taken parking space they're not entitled to.
today I read a fact that the mental condition and stress levels of teenagers is close to that of mental patients in the 1950s.  This is a widely misused quote/statistic. It was originally reported in the 1980s, then a meta-analysis was done in 2000 about studies done through 1993. I can't find anything more recent. But even if anxiety has only gone up since 1993, it's part of a continuing trend, not something that is distinctly new about the 21st century.  http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/psp7961007.pdf  The only reason why things seem more prevalent than they used to be is because of the Internet and more of a willingness to admit things like depression, especially among boys.
One for example I found by looking at the "What's New" feed at Internet Archive - they add a few thousand new books a day, all very old and very obscure. One day I just decided to read one. No had ever reviewed it on Amazon, Goodreads or anywhere else on Google search. I was the first person in the age of the Internet to post anything about it. The last review of the book was from 1912 when it was published.   What book was it?
Thanks.  Though you do realize that these are not comparable to what people are typically complain about? The slow walker. The person who suddenly stops at the top of the train steps. The person who thinks that the whole world needs to hear them going through the ring tones on their phone. The person who falls into an open manhole because they weren't paying attention, etc.  Google tells me the first picture is of the day Japan surrendered, and the second two are of people walking their dogs in parks, not walking down Fifth Avenue or some other crowded area.
Gross. I'm literally looking at my OJ now and the ingredient is: Juice. Nothing else.

This seems more appropriate to ask in /r/askhistorians.  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Proin auctor, ipsum sodales commodo interdum, ligula odio ultricies felis, id vehicula nulla dolor vitae nibh. Mauris a ligula nisi. Morbi nisi elit, posuere sed neque vel, congue commodo tortor.   So this doesn't get deleted for being too short.
I thought it was terrific but you have to have a certain frame of mind to enjoy it. If you're subscribed to /r/atheism, it's probably not for you.
Did you see what I quoted?   But if you don't like that, here are a couple of other sources:  It would appear from Numbers 31:2627 and Deuteronomy 20:1011 that prisoners of war could be, and were, taken into bondage, but it has been contended that no prisoners of war were ever taken into private slavery (Kaufmann, Y., Toledot 1 (1937), 651).  http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/slavery.html  In Kadmoniot Ha-Halakha, Shmuel Rubinstein (Kovno, 5686) writes (chapter 22): The gemara (Kiddushin 25a) teaches: 'There are twenty-four protruding limbs of a person, for all of which a slave is set free, and these are: the tips of the fingers, toes, ears, nose, penis and breasts... Rabbi says: Also testicles. Ben Azzai says: Also the tongue. The situation of a slave in ancient times was truly awful. He was like an object owned by his master, who was free to do whatever he wanted in order to force the slave to perform hard labor day and night, and to use him for all kinds of perverted purposes. The master could beat his slave mercilessly for any major or minor wrongdoing; he could permanently maim his limbs without fear of any punishment. For any purpose desired by the master, the slave could be blinded. Herodotus writes (4:2) that the Scythians used to blind their captive slaves so that they would work in producing butter. And there were several other such purposes for which slaves would be struck with blindness, TO THE POINT WHERE PUTTING OUT EYES BECAME A SYMBOL OF SLAVERY. Likewise, prisoners taken in war were blinded as a sign of slavery, and this was done particularly to kings and officers of the defeated army, as a sign of revenge and enslavement. For the same reason, Shimshon was blinded by the Philistines (Shoftim 16:21), and this is apparently also the meaning of the words of Nachash the Ammonite to the men of Yavesh Gil'ad: By this condition I will make a covenant with you: if you all put out your right eye (Shmuel I 11:2), as if to say, In order that you will be slaves and prisoners of war to me. For the same reason, King Tzidkiyahu was blinded by Nevukhadnetzar (Melakhim II 28:7), and this is also the meaning of the words of Datan and Aviram to Moshe, Will you put out the eyes of those men? As if to say, Are we considered in your eyes as slaves, prisoners of war, that you will exert your power over us and to do us whatever you wish, to drag us wherever you decide? This arrogance on the part of the enslavers seems to have lasted until much later times, explaining even Herod's blinding of Bava ben Buta (Bava Batra 4a).  http://vbm-torah.org/archive/intparsha70/18-70mishpatim.htm
My old boss used to swear by that book and also Getting To Yes. You know how often he got to yes? Never. Never ever. These sorts of things only work when both parties are there in good faith, that even though the parties don't agree, they're both are interested in resolving the situation. When you're dealing with somebody whose attitude is "my way or the highway" you can build rapport with them until the cows come home, you'll still never get anywhere.

If you like odd mysteries, I'd like to recommend Claire DeWitt and the City of the Dead by Sara Gran   It's not a perfect book. The mystery is actually the weakest part of it and the main character, Claire DeWitt, can be a little off-putting, but the whole thing is so unusual, mystical, thought-provoking, richly evocative of post-Katrina New Orleans and even occasionally laugh-out-loud funny, that I thought I'd give it a rec.  It's vaguely reminiscent of The Boy Detective Fails by Joe Meno, so I'm going to give that a mention too.  http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9231999-claire-dewitt-and-the-city-of-the-dead  http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/102504.The_Boy_Detective_Fails

Have you read two unrelated books around the same time that had something surprising in common?   Maybe the question doesn't really make sense, but I couldn't figure out how to phrase it better. Lately I feel like I've been reading two books around the same time that have nothing to do with each other but funnily have similar aspects or elements.  For example, Friday I read Where'd You Go, Bernadette by Maria Semple, which is a modern-day domestic dramady set in Seattle, and Saturday I finished The Abominable by Dan Simmons, which is a historical drama/thriller largely set in England and Mount Everest. But both books have a connection to Antarctica.   I didn't read these two books together on purpose, in fact I didn't know that Antarctica figured into Where'd You Go, Bernadette -- I took it out from the library without even reading the book jacket.   Has this happened to you?
