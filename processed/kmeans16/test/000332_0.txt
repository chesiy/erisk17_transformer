* Xbox One * PST, California * 34 Hunter, Warlock, Titan * PvP mainly, but I am also a master swordbearer and help with holding relics and things like that. Would like a team to go flawless with in trials * Mic: Yes (13 y/o girl here, not may people like my voice. I can go mute if you want) * GT: Moreos * [Here is my BNet profile](https://www.bungie.net/en/Profile/254/7272607), I have been getting into PvP a lot recently, especially Trials. I am looking for people to play with in PvP (I play all game modes) and/or teamates for ToO. Shoot me a message saying you're from Reddit, and we can play anytime :)
It's good, very bloody lol.  They eventually leave the farm, imho it gets a lot better once they do that   It's a good show, but you aren't really missing out. It's like, I would recommend it but there's other shows I would tell you to watch first.  Archer, Under the Dome  [Can't Feel My Face - The Weeknd](https://youtu.be/dqt8Z1k0oWQ), [Actual Cannibal Shia LeBouf]( https://youtu.be/o0u4M6vppCI)
Thanks!
Yes, I'll be on from around 3:45 to 7:30 tomorrow.
[XB1] Swordbearer/Relic Holder for hire!   NM or HM, I'm good at both. Shoot me a message my GT is Jade Sueta. Can guarantee a kill.
Yes.
Thank you for caring, it really means a lot. My step mom is getting gradually better, she buys me Apple cider, and snacks for school. I really think I can make it just a few more months. I AM talking to people about it. You, my mom, I even call my brother in San Francisco from time to time just to vent. Again, thank you.
Wow I never knew that!
What is your favorite color?
That's great. Naturevideo games. Get out and explore.   It seems like everyone I meet that has a mic just wants to point a gun at my head and make me join the crew. I would rather get shot a million times than join a crew with those douches. But I'm sure sometime I'll find a good crew and some friends. Thanks for taking the time to write all this out, I hope you don't get eaten by a bear, and I'm on mobile so sorry if I made a bunch of spelling errors. Farewell, pleasant internet friend.
Cool. If there's ever an opportunity to have more fun, I will always take it. Thanks, I was gonna see if any of my friends had gta5, and now I can't wait to get back to my xbox and level up some more :D. Do you have xbox by any chance?
Not that it matters or anything, but I'm a girl:)
I just added you
Yaaaay i love them!
I have never watched it, but have been planning to. On school days, I wake up at six, walk to school, walk home, do homework, go to soccer, come home, eat dinner, shower , then go night night and repeat. Since I'm on break or on the weekends I visit my moms house the most I can, come home Sunday, go to sleep, play xbox, back to school. Consoles are only allowed on the weekends
Gt: Jade Sueta. Im on tomorrow
