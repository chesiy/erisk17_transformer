Coffee in Las Vegas   I'm moving to Las Vegas next week and I'm afraid there won't be any good coffee shops/roasters there. I've previously lived in very coffee-friendly cities, SF and LA, so I might be a little bit spoiled.   http://sprudge.com/jackpot-big-cash-payout-for-finca-las-vegas.html  This article is over 2 years old and I'm pretty sure there hasn't been any progress. Anyone have any suggestions or am I shit out of luck for the next 3 years??
awesome, totally looking forward to kickstarting this!
yeah! science bitch!

Made a post with the exact same title a day ago, didn't get any karma (Okay face)  http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/ptgyx/dat_ass/

I saw the same thing happen, except it was an average guy running full speed on the treadmill. It was very early in the morning so the gym was relatively empty. He slipped, and the treadmill shot him straight back, his towel flying into his face. Dazed and confused, he looked around to see if anyone saw. I did, but he didn't realize so he tried to get back on, without realizing that the treadmill was still on full speed. He slipped again, fell on his knees and got shit backwards into the stationary bikes. Probably one of the funniest things I've seen at the gym.

I remember playing Final Fantasy VII on PS but I could never finish the game because my parents were too cheap to buy me a memory card so I would have to start over or leave the game running every single time. True story.

No, unfortunately they only lasted a year. I remembered these in middle school and how I begged my mom to buy them though. Here's the link:  http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1913612_1913610_1913561,00.html
Who ranks up there as your worst Giants' signings ever?   Who else would like to see up here? I definitely cannot stand Tejada this year. I know it is way too early to DFA him and experts would bash this move as a bad way of running a franchise. But at what point would you think 'hmm, this guy's season isn't going to turn around'? He is bad on offense, bad on defense (he seems worse at short than 3B), and is a constant letdown with runners in scoring position. At $6 million for this one year, I would say he ranks as one of the worst in franchise history. Off the top of my head, the only other horrible signing I remember would be Alfonzo. Thoughts? Discuss.
