Scientists trace an ancient connection between native tribes in the Amazon and Australian Aborigines: We have overwhelming evidence of two founding populations in the Americas.
Yep. The ones with a nice, predictable "twist" at the end immediately arouse my skepticism. This one, if it is is fake, is an incredibly unique and chilling story that doesn't give off the "spooky movie" vibe. I can't believe it didn't get more upvotes.
I've recently realized that "why is there something rather than nothing?" is actually the *easy* question of fundamental ontogeny. While scientists and philosophers don't have an exact answer yet, it is obvious that somehow "nothingness" is unstable/impossible, as seen in Quantum Physics.  My own personal preference is for the theory is that formal logic is necessarily true, but also contradictory if it doesn't have a final referent to something that's not a logical statement (that is, a material object or something like it rather than an abstraction like a rule of logic.) This creates a need for a "necessary object."  So if what was called the Ultimate Question is really the easy question, then what's the hard question? It has to be why *this particular* something, rather than any of the other possibilities that might have served as adequate necessary objects.  Even if we live as part of a "multiverse," this doesn't solve the problem, as there can be only a finite number of universes, or else all the logical contradictions of Actual Infinities would arise.  What does any of this have to do with consciousness? Not too much, if we define consciousness in terms of awareness, qualia, etc. But if we re-frame consciousness as being primarily about *choice*, with those other qualities emerging later as consequences, then I think we're on to something.
The Coming Age of the Mile-High Tower: "Even a single Manhattan block could accommodate a 2,500-foot tower. A superblock  say, the one where Madison Square Garden now sits  could support something much bigger than that."
New Age convention in town?
That subreddit sucks, actually. It's 90% "HEY GUYZ I JUS HAD MY FIRST LUCD DREAM XDDDDD"  Plus weird taboos. There was a whole discussion about chakras and and the third eye in which even some of the mods participated, but so much as mention shared dreams or dream characters having their own personalities outside of your subconscious, and it gets deleted immediately. I fail to see how one topic is any more or less New Agey than the other.
His story feeds in to the "became great with no formal training or higher education" myth that people (especially Americans) love. Except that in his case it was actually partially true. Combined with the whole "paranormal" element to his story as I mentioned above, I think this is what makes him a popular favorite more than any "exoticization."
If all you're able to show is that the average female athlete gets 10% more scholarship money than the average male athlete, I hardly think that's an injustice worthy of such outrage. Yes it should be equal not 10% more for women but that's no reason to get rid of Title IX.  You should read your own link: Schools are in compliance with Title IX if they meet *any* of the three prongs, whereas you are arguing as if they have to meet *all* of them.  Also an interesting tidbit in the article: Title IX has been used, though rarely, to increase the number of male sports or to give more funding to male sports as in the Kentucky case.   No they don't. Further the NFL does not do that at all; you're referring to a particular source of revenue that is shared among them; it's not the case for ALL revenue.  Nor is it for college athletics under Title IX. The salaries of the football coaches alone often equal the entire budget for female sports.   I'm not as equally productive as you. Paying me like I am doesn't prove that.  No, but nor are women's sports "paid" equally to men's. Only the *opportunities for participation* (proportionate to interest) must be funded equally. Like I said at some schools the football team alone is more than half the budget. If Title IX really meant an equal division of revenue, that would be illegal.
We probably don't agree much on politics I'm guessing, but you make some very good points about the counter-productivity of *means-tested* benefits, ones the article and the comments on the NYT site also touch on, namely:  1.) Child care + cost of car + commuting would cost more than many of these low-wage jobs pay.   2.) "Job lock" syndrome where taking a low-paying job makes employers in your former industry far less likely to hire you, and also severely cuts down on your time to search for a job (witness the one guy who was fired for asking for a single day off to care for his dying mother.), and, if you get fired again, the fact that you had a low-wage job even for one day can reduce or even eliminate your unemployment benefits (I know this is true in Michigan.)  3.) "Abuse" of the welfare system by people making phony disability claims. The fact that SDI is welfare for white people is an open secret in Washington. There are counties in West Virgina and Kentucky where almost half of households get the majority of their income from SDI. You never hear the GOP screaming about cutting SDI, and for good reason, it's their most loyal voters who are on it. I know a woman who gets physically disgusted whenever someone so much as mentions Obama, and yet has been on SDI since 9/11 for "psychological trauma" from the event (she did work in New York, but not in the immediate vicinity of the Twin Towers). She uses her income in a so-far futile attempt to launch a singing career.  My solution would be to have a *universal* Basic Income and a *universal* health program and child care, this removing the economic dis-incentive to work that many of these men face, rather than just slashing these programs which will probably only increase the social destruction.  Fat chance of that happening in the current political environment, but one can dream.
But you can't then argue that the public is getting screwed when they can purchase for the same price.  Yes, the public still is screwed because the price is higher than it should be. My (saved) dollar that I earned through actual economic activity can't earn its natural rate of interest as a result. It's called [Financial Repression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_repression).
Only the first mortgage purchases can be argued to be this, but I've seen no evidence to back your position  That's why I said "who knows what" quality. I have my suspicions but due to lack of transparency in these financial instruments we will probably never know.   They traded an interest bearing dollar for an interest bearing reserve.  They traded a bond with a fixed payment structure for a demand deposit. These are not the same thing even if they both bear interest. You can't argue they have "equal value" when the "value" on one side of the transaction can be arbitrarily determined by the Fed's authority.
It's gotten some negative reviews (including on this sub), but I found [Eyes of the Mothman](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fmkz_RrQxU) to be quite good (age restricted sign-in required.)
If OBE's represent physically real phenomena, they should be relatively easy to test. Just put some random objects in a locked room and have someone who is out-of-body float over and take a look at them. Very simple and very scientific. Monroe claimed to have a technology that could reliably produce OBE's.  However, he seemed far more interested in cataloging scads of "other realms" and altered states which he numbered like Focus 1-100 and encounters with alien beings that were completely unverifiable. It is interesting stuff and might very well represent real *inner* experiences (that is, I don't think Monroe was just making stuff up - he was a wealthy man before starting his paranormal research), but he was not a proper scientist.
He would also know how to spell Colombia
What does the skeptic community think about all the claims of radical new technologies that have been making the rounds recently? I'm thinking specifically of the D-Wave Quantum Computer and the E-Cat/Hot-Cat LENR reactors.   I realize this is a very broad question, but I've seen some pretty out-there claims being accepted uncritically by the media recently. Of course, tech breakthroughs do happen from time to time, so I'm not convinced these devices are scams either. I would like to know what a group of people inclined to be skeptical about extraordinary claims thinks about this issue.
The Illusion of the Gifted Child
New data reveals that the Universe is lopsided on a vast scale. What can this mean? It could mean dark energy is changing over time, or that were seeing some pattern imprinted on the Universe from before the Big Bang. No one really knows yet.
I was thinking this myself yesterday. I heard a documentary on in the background with a female narrator and I just knew it was early 80's without even seeing the video quality or hearing much about the subject matter. Turns out it was 1981.   My completely unscientific theory is there was some leftover "hippie" intonation that sort of merged with the "polite secretary" but was then pushed out by the "valley girl" and the "local news announcer" sometime in the mid-80's. I fondly wish for the return of that old female accent but I'm not too hopeful. In fact the default female public-speaking voice seems to have become even harsher and more aloof-sounding in recent years, especially on radio commercials.
I'm not sure, but it wouldn't surprise me. It seemed the obvious "next step" in his analysis, the fascinating thing might be to investigate why he never got there (ideology? a "scholarly" rather than a "critical" approach to mythology? maybe he was trapped in the myth himself?)  I've read some criticism of Campbell that claimed he was proto-Fascist for reducing all of human culture to the struggle of the Hero, I think that's going too far, but it could be that he was too wedded to his idea of the Monomyth to see the dialectical possibility in the Hero breaking out of it.
Is that exactly how the problem was stated to you? Because I can't make much sense out of it. It looks like a Combinatorial problem, those sometimes have special cases for n=1.
Interesting links, I will check them out. I'd heard of the first idea but not the second.   I am not an expert in these fields, but my opinion is not just "empty statements," as it is informed by and resembles that of some people who are experts. If I'm going to expend the time conversing with you I do expect some civility on your part.
The new age, pseudo spiritualism that is often saddled on it.  Do you distinguish that from traditional belief in the Siddhis, or is it all superstitious accretion to you?  I'm ambivalent - some mediators I respect have claimed supernatural experiences, but I can't bring myself to totally buy it. It's easy to enter into a dreamlike state when you're in meditation. I've yet to see anyone levitate, in other words, and that Discovery Channel "documentary" doesn't count.
would be a strong indication that a people migrated in from that neighbor.  *Some* people, yes, but not necessarily a large number that would change the genetic character of a population. Material cultures have been known to spread in pre-history without corresponding changes in the physical characteristics of a population. Interestingly, there are sometimes small numbers of distinct "foreigner" burials - probably remains of the merchants or outcasts who spread the material culture. I'm not sure if this is the case in Japan or not. I know this phenomenon is documented in prehistoric Britain and elsewhere in Europe.  The culture you're thinking of is the Jomon. Studies I've seen have said that modern Japanese ancestors are anywhere from 10-40% Jomon, with the remainder being Korean in origin.
From what I understand, you can get it and be overwhelmed by the pleasure and snap out of it. This happened to me a few times, it wasn't a "freak out," but certainly a sense of "whoah, too much!" In my mind it's closely related  to Lacan's concept of *joissance* (overwhelming or "surplus" pleasure.) You have to "enlarge" your mind before you can handle it.
Interesting question. I may take heat for this, but there are a lot of similarities between Hitler's expansion towards the East and the genocide of the Native Americans in the US. Indeed Hitler thought of the two as similar and used that to morally justify his invasions. See the book *The Wages of Destruction* for a good discussion of this.  Science in Nazi Germany was highly politicized. Anyone who didn't get on the mythical "Aryan" bandwagon was sacked or worse. In a scenario where Hitler "won" the war - not necessarily conquer the world, just survive as a regime into the 1950's or 60's, I don't see this really changing.  Most people who have thought through "Alternate Histories" about a postwar Nazi regime see the main threat coming from even more radical Nazis - the pagan/mystical SS clashing with the more Christian "preserve traditional German values" crowd. There was a great book a while back, can't remember the title, that was set during a Nazi "Cultural Revolution" during the 60's where radical ultra-Aryan students "assaulted the party" for its conservatism under the direction of a new Fuhrer who took over after Hitler's death.  In short, no, I think the Nazi ideology was too extreme to ever moderate like the American "manifest destiny" ideology eventually did. Instead it would probably have turned inward on itself and collapsed in a series of purges and crazy attempts to resurrect Atlantis (Thule) or genetically engineer Aryan supermen or some such craziness.
Thanks for the reply. I understood the first paragraph but kind of lost you in the second. I've been through Analysis but it's been a while. Maybe time to dust off the old notes...
The Loneliness of the Guyanas
Because as any high school politics student knows, political alignments are not on a line (they're more on a grid, with x and y coordinates, etc.)   I'm more of a "horseshoe" guy. I think that grid is Libertarian propaganda: "Wow, look, there's a party that believes in *both* types of freedom!"   Right and left are labels given by American propagandists in the McCarthy era.  No, they come from where the factions sat in the French National Assembly after the Revolution.  His mistake was making his country a socialist dictatorship (communism), rather than a socialist republic.  I don't think he had a choice once he seized power. The majority of the Russian people in 1917 were rural and religious. They would not have voted for Bolshevism if given the chance. A Tolstoy-style religious socialism might have had a better shot.
The school system can fail kids without repercussions if needed. The budget isn't set according to how many students graduate.   This is key. In the US there is tremendous pressure on teachers to pass everyone because funding and ratings are based on "on-time" graduation rates.
[Here is one story](http://www.wwaytv3.com/2011/09/01/one-dead-another-custody-after-overnight-shooting-rocky-point). You can find plenty more searching police registers and medical journals.   There was a case in a town near ours of a guy high on "bath salts" who tunneled into his neighbor's basement trying to kill him because he thought the guy was having sex with his wife. He had been a longtime marijuana user with no criminal record beyond possession and no history of mental illness.  Part of the problem with "bath salts" is they can be many different chemicals - you don't know what you're getting. I agree with a previous poster who said if marijuana was legal none of this would be happening, because most often this stuff is advertized as "legal pot" and sold in skate shops, head shops, etc. which pot users frequent.
Dante's Inferno (short version)
The Irrational Optimist: The many fans of the "Rational Optimist" might not know that the bestseller praising unregulated capitalism and attacking "parasite" government was written by a bailed-out banker. Oh, and it's also filled with errors and misstatements.
