I wish I knew how these were put in there, but it looks like it's more commonly [done] (http://imgur.com/7oKqdcL) .
According to jihadist groups "Al-Nusra Dzhabhat" was shot down near the settlement of Arafah in the mountain massif of Jabal Akrad:  This UAV is easily recognizable as the "Aileron-3CB" produced by "ENIKS." And this drone reportedly fell on the territory controlled by the government troops in the area known for last year's battles town Kessab : Fragments of such UAVs Ukrainians were presented as "downed Russian 'heads -10 ''
Ukrainian battalion soldiers "Donbass" managed to pull out from the territory controlled by the militia forces in Shirokino - BMP-2, lined with a few months ago.  "On the left side there is the flag of" New Russia "and a couple of not very significant holes. Because of damage: torn beaten track and optics. The engine, transmission, gun, fire control - all in working order. Even ammunition available.
This isn't the first time this has happened, I like his response where he said we'll help you via going forward, isn't that the same old story?

Maximum jail sentence for rioting in Baltimore is... life, according to these state guidelines http://t.co/gLoO79JvRv [PDF]
500 Guard troops in Baltimore; 1,500 more on the way
I confirm this, I had that plan located at the bottom of the page, 5gb, I think 100 min cap, but you can use Google Voice, if your out of minutes. Was a great plan, and then I switched to the 2 for $100 on Tmobile. I would seriously spend more if I didn't have unlimited. I think it's a nice gimmick for them to say, you only pay what you use, well that would be a lot of dinero.
Interesting, thanks.
I would like to see what Belichick and Co prioritize to avoid the so called Bubble? In years past they have traded down and that has paid dividends, but with the Patriots getting older, maybe he takes a chance on a high salary player but I doubt it as we have seen with Welker and other players looking for large contracts.
It's almost become like a machine, follow the Zebra and hang on, granted if your not in shape you won't last. I think it's neat though, there so many different ways to win. Example, in basketball they created Hack a Shaq which would prove positive for the opposition in regaining possession without giving up time and points.
Yep thanks for your advice, no one mentioned litigation. We are provided with a ABA therapist already, private insurance so we do get collaborate and have things to work on at home, just want it to carry into the classroom, except there is so much pushback. Thanks for the education, you must be well versed in special education laws...

Great write-up, I can see his military values carried over into coaching, his interest in the intangibles of a player is what puts him over other coaces, he's going against the grain.
