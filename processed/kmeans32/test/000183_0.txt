Hey guys so I tried something different and recorded this entirely from the alternate cockpit angle to give a different sense of speed, also if anyone is keen on the track/weather settings they are as follows:  Munnar (Forward) Time: 18:30x15 or 30 Weather: Dynamic

Lol mate you have to be joking. AoU was nowhere near as bad as you remember it. Yeah that scene where he walks up to an old John Deere tractor they don't even sell anymore which is contextually located in it's natural habitat, A FARM, combined with his character making a snarky pun... Or that 2 second shot of Quicksilver grabbing Adidas shoes out of his closet? Your examples suck and the fact that you tried to say that the product placement in AoU wasn't as bad as Transformers shows why no one has taken your opinion seriously.   Take your [pill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4YwLlB9daM) and rethink your argument.
For clothing you could always have a look at [ACRONYM](http://www.acrnm.com/). They are expensive however, but from doing some light forum browsing, the quality seems to be worth the price.
Most MCU one's are in my opinion. The best marvel property posters are the ones FOX made for The Wolverine. Check out:  [Poster 1](http://www.thewolverinemovie.com/reveal/assets/images/fb-share.jpg)  [Poster 2](http://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/the-wolverine-poster-silver-samurai.jpg)  [Poster 3](http://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/the-wolverine-poster-yukio.jpg)  [Poster 4](http://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/Jean_Grey_The_Wolverine_poster_2.jpg)  [Poster 5](http://whysoblu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/the-wolverine-viper-poster1-610x906.jpg)   EDIT: Yes i realise that wolverine isn't MCU
This is what I believe as well, makes sense as GG are going to focus on their new game and potentially turn it into a franchise, hope it's great as they are a very talented group, who have unfortunately been relegated to making Killzone titles since the PS3 launched. With the writer of Fallout NV, I do have high hopes for the story of Horizon.
Damn haha, well here in Sydney it's a different story it's speed camera central. Just this morning I was driving through a road close to the city which had two red light speed cameras one set of lights apart.
Personally I am rooting for the P1. Ever since I played Need for Speed II all those years back, the Mclaren F1 has and still is my favourite super car ever made and the P1 reminded me of the F1 just in it's sheer ridiculousness. My other pick would be the 918 since that car is pushing the hybrid technology forward the most out of the 3 also I feel that it looks a ton better than the La Ferrari.   La Ferrari is the last one for me since I always feel that Ferrari are always up themselves in terms of how they present their brand. Don't get me wrong they make great cars however how the way they present themselves to motor journalists and car enthusiasts, just turns me off them. I know I didn't really analyse from a technical POV which would come first, this is just who I want to come first.
Ah yes I am glad I wasn't the only one who got a cyberpunk vibe from the music. The film looks really interesting as well, although I heard it did pretty bad in festivals it will be cool to see what the film is about at least. If anything it will look good and have a killer soundtrack!  EDIT: The [Symmetry Remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2Rk-pLgtYE) is also awesome.
I find Driveclub pretty relaxing, just go on a time trial with it on fast time lapse and drive a point to point. Not trying to beat a fast time but just driving how you want.
Funnily enough I saw the first two films in HFR and the last one in regular 24FPS and I think I would have preferred to see this one in 48 since there's a lot more action happening in the film. I did notice some specific parts where the scene appeared to be jittery, especially during the long panning shots of landscapes. In your comment regarding the actors looking superimposed, I felt that they still looked superimposed in 24, I think this to do with the overly digital look of the film which is just a big step backwards when compared to the LOTR trilogy. Personally though I think Battle of Five Armies serves to be the one that benefits from the 48 fps since there's not much downtime during the film.
So uhh you gonna tell us where you bought that?
Personally I think the character is fine the way he is since the clone wars expanded upon Boba in a sufficient enough manner that would lead him into becoming a big bounty hunter. The studio would never let him have his face covered for the whole film, so that idea is out of the question. Also it would severely limit the actors ability to portray his full range of performances.

I'm pretty sure its because he was fucking sienna millers character, I think that's the idea since he managed to get out of the drug game unscathed but was undone by something as trivial as sleeping with someone else's girl.
According to Hans Zimmer they are actually working on releasing the track for free. Here's the [source](http://hans-zimmer.com/index.php?rub=disco id=1256) which I got from the [Nolan Fans forum](http://www.nolanfans.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=43 t=12452 start=1200) if you scroll down you can see where they discuss it.
Yeah I am really hoping they put private lobbies in soon, I just want to race my friends only, not these muppets who spin you out in the corners.
I see, thanks guys.
This game. Where do I begin? Deus Ex:HR was probably my GOTY for 2011 and while I understand that it had its flaws, the gameplay, level design and music all came together beautifully. It is one of the games where I feel that the sequel may be near perfect if they do it right and learn from the mistakes of HR (boss fights, providing equal xp no matter your playstyle and an overhaul of the graphics). The art style of this game is amazing, the gold and yellow hues of the cyberpunk renaissance (as they call it) exude that overly lit up, light polluting world of the future. If anyone is interested here are some screen shots I had taken that further reinforce how awesome the art style simply is.

Hmm the trailer points it out to be fairly generic but then again so did Edge of Tomorrow. I'm hoping that it's actually a really smart/cool sci fi film and the trailer is just aiming to get as many people into theatres as possible.
Man this actually looks badass! The shooting looks awesome.
Damn haha I had no idea!
This one's easy!  [Moby-God Moving Over The Face of Waters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3IXg8t8Ybs)  Used in the ending scene for Heat (1995).
I did Day 3 of the Framing Frame for the first time with 3 buddies on very hard difficulty (stealth) and it took so many fucking tries to get it right. That stage I feel really depends on the placement of the items and layout of cameras. Although doing it stealth and getting all the gold is worth the effort as it nets a nice $590k. It can mentally break you though.
I didn't mean to undersell her. To be honest I've only seen her in maybe 2 films, Chicago and Down with Love haha.
Yeah I have the game running on a 5.1 Surround mix and it's pretty abysmal, however if you run it through headphones it's a lot better.
Hah here in Sydney if you look under 25 they will ask you for ID. I never get asked though and I am 22, the beard helps haha
I actually think this would fit Ridley Scott perfectly, combined with a good screenplay of course *cough Prometheius cough*. If the film follows the first game and is set in the 12 century I feel that he could absolutely nail the look and feel of the setting as well as the sci fi elements. For reference I think people should check out the directors cut for Kingdom of Heaven as it is set roughly in the same time period as AC1 and gives a good vision for what he could achieve.
If they do it I hope they make it as unique as the [Tron Legacy Disney Castle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBN-Iolxa1o) was!
Sony have already said that the price of the PS4 was not finalized until E3, and that they were prepared to sell it for less than they are in order to undercut the Xbox One, which was their ultimate goal from the start. When Microsoft announced their higher-than-expected pricing, Sony execs breathed a sigh of relief. This was all discussed numerous times in a wide variety of interviews with several Sony execs. The prices were not known to anyone outside of these two companies until the announcements were made.    I don't think Respawn chose to make it for the Xbox One as many developers with Respawn have stated that they are upset that PS4 owners won't be able to experience the game since they want it to reach as many households as possible. It was a very corporate decision to keep it to the Xbox One.
Did anyone here see the original cut for the Oldboy (2013) remake?   I have heard that the majority of the film was cut down and it's easy to tell after viewing the film so I was wondering if anyone here had managed to see the full length version at any press screenings etc? If so did it hold up to the original film?
For those who don't know the original [Alien trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjLamj-b0I8) is what the Prometheus trailer was based off.
