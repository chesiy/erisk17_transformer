Oh. Well, then I guess you have no choice but to put them like in your screenshots. (And I disagree with the idea to hide "competing" effects, because not only would it be confusing but what if the effects are of different strength? E.g. their power might fade out over time.)  I think the solution is to simplify the symbols. They "look too good", they are too fancy. They should be as simple as symbols used in traffic signs, and they shouldn't use more than one color. Ideally, all colors would be the same, but I guess that adding a fitting color to the effect (stronger = green, weaker = red, ...) does make sense.
So, you don't like feminism and hence like Islam. That is so wonderfully honest, it makes me smile.  As for the rest: I value truth above all. You don't. It wouldn't make sense to discuss with you, since the discussion would itself be about what's true, and you already decided that you don't quite care about that. I pity you.
It's also intuitive for people who have seen various phases of the Moon many times. The association of a sphere comes up. The brain does derive shapes and distances via a lot of other factors *automatically* (Not a process requiring immediate consciousness / thinking.), and similar things would apply to Earth: How far can you look from *this* mountain? Ok, now what do you see from *that* mountain, thousands of kilometers away? etc.  Someone who infers that the Earth is a "sphere" might just have a very strong Occam's Razor aspect in their mind, something we all have, it's part of our base functionality. "First, assume that the other similar thing is indeed the same thing with changed properties." Applies e.g. to the coexistence of beings.
Well, the reason I wrote this wasn't just to point out the obvious mistake - I also hadn't seen the comment in question yet because it is ... *somewhere*. The two comments I objected to, however, knew precisely what they were talking about. Thanks for the link.
I am God and will kill you.
GOD FUCKING DAMNED, now I typed all this shit but can't post it because the link has been removed. So, I'll just put it here. I am fucking ANGRY now. Someone has to suffer for this.  ----  The world will *certainly* be a much better place without religion, because religion does the opposite of what science does, in two ways:  1) Instead of using the method of doubt to find greater levels of certainty, it uses the method of faith to assign levels of certainty to claims that don't deserve it.  2) Instead of bringing the truth about the people's environment to them and thus increasing survivability and quality of life, they give fantasies the same value as actual facts and, well, basically allow people to live a life in a fantasy world: Many people sharing the same fantasy and claiming that it is actually true "makes it real" via the omnipresent people who believe *that* it is real. The brain who decided to unreasonably believe, no matter what, can conveniently confuse this quasi-manifestation of its truth-value with *actual* manifestation. "Might makes right." and "Might makes reality." to some degree.  If religion would go away, the most potent agent for helping people to confuse reality and fantasy  and the most potent promoter of unreason would go away. It would finally be *possible* - because the *opposition of BILLIONS* would be absent - to establish a kingdom of truth. Where presenting fiction as facts (aka LYING) would be much more stigmatized as it is today. Today, if you really look at it, people distort the truth 100 times a day.  When was the last time you realized that all stores that show you prices like 3.99 instead of 4 are *lying* to you for the purpose of making more money?  Intentionally distorting the truth is lying. Intentional informational deception is lying. In a world with a much higher overall truth-level, the presence of a lie would be much more resented than it is in this fantasy-infested cesspool that I did not choose to have to dwell in. It's an emergence / threshold thing. With a higher truth level, introducing lies would be rejected a lot more.  But why truth at all? Well, do you want to touch the hot plate? No. That's a very coarse example for why you'd prefer to know the truth, but if I'd have to list all smaller examples, I'd have to type for centuries, so you have to extrapolate. The more fine-grained the presence of truth about the world is in our minds, the better our lives and coexistence will be.
*Yesterday* morning, the N24 news station had a report about two guys regularly visiting a demented (or somesuch) senior citizen and bullying (emotionally torturing and such) him.  Afterwards, they had some also senior-citizen-ish psychologist or expert or whatever he was tell us the reasons. From memory: "One reason is probably violence done to them as children. Another reason is the playing of violent video games."  I thought they were fucking shitting me.
Evolution is so screamingly logical, those who don't get its implications either just haven't thought enough about it, or they wouldn't be able to produce a proper result even with enough thought.  A being that builds itself based on a plan. Then it self-replicates, but in an environment (Universe.) that is always stormy on the nuclear level. Hence the result is often changed because the plan was altered. If the outcome was viable, now we have *two* such fronts on which new beings are drafted. All this over many millions of years all over the planet even on many (spatially) vertical levels, which is a bit overlooked by the deniers ... If anything, we'd need evidence *against* evolution, not at all evidence *for* it.
It's just a useless statement, at least phrased like this. There was surely a meaningful idea behind it, but the sentence doesn't quite transport it.
What if the truth is that the universe is heaven-in-the-making, and that there is indeed no afterlife, but once the project is done, people will live forever, and those who lived before participated in completing the project. If you knew that this is true, would this give you enough of a sense of purpose? If not, why not? (If not, I think that would basically be selfishness, but that's just the only guess I can come up with.)
damn our US
Depends on the wrapper approach. I've used launch4j myself (Damn, when will they leave SourceForge behind already?) and have read its manual and such somewhat, but that's a while ago. I'm pretty sure it said that the jar isn't unpacked temporarily, but this could mean that they just have some trick to start it as a file from RAM. They could, of course, run a Java program themselves that uses the jar as a plugin, so to speak. Classloader and all that. In this case, I am convinced that signing would not be required or helpful. (And can jar files be signed at all?)  In any case: I have seen "Unsigned! Hurr!" warnings by Windows regarding EXEs but can't remember ever having seen any regarding jars.
Well, billions (e.g. 90 from Germany) have been given to Greece in the last few years. The earlier Greece wisens and mans up, the less the country will further deteriorate, the earlier the payback can begin. Our leaders have to answer to us for the money they gave away, at least I would hope so. It's more than 1000 per head!
Ye, some other guy explained it in this subthread. But to me, it's a plothole. It doesn't have to be a "paradox". It's (Would be.) just completely against how the characters should behave, how a sane person would act.  For example, here's something from the *terrible* movie that Taken 3 is. Not really bad spoilers, because one key event is early in the movie, and this whole thing I describe is not just asinine, it's also quite unimportant. And the movie is shit, as I said. So: [Dad puts a laced drink in a place where he knows his daughter would find it, with a note saying "drink me right away" or somesuch. She does so and goes to school. In class, she asks if she is excused because she feels nauseous. Goes to the girl's rest room (Apparently the only one the school has. Well, maybe it was just the clearly closest one.) and is surprised to meet dad in the last cabin. He tells her that he laced the drink and that he has a counter-agent for her so that she feels less shitty. She drinks it, then they exchange expressions of affection. He asks her if all is well and tells her to continue in the way she did so far. So, why did he kinda *poison* his daughter just to get her into that booth? Instead of just telling her to *fake* feeling ill? For no remotely justifying reason. Well, she surprisingly tells him something of value, but he couldn't expect that. On his way out, by the way, he pulls the school's fire alarm, having everyone flee in panic and destroying public and the pupil's property in the tens of thousands of dollars. Oh, did I mention that his wife, actual mother of this very daughter, had been murdered earlier in the movie? What an opportunity to poison the daughter to have some father daughter time on the toilet.](#spoiler)  No paradox, just completely failed writing. But if you don't call at least one of the things I described a plothole, then I can only back away slowly.
(too convoluted to explain)  I hope you get well soon.
You are right and wrong at the same time, and I completely disagree with your vote score. This post is worth discussing.  For the longest time I have suspected the same thing, but lately I have come to appreciate the strong emotional push that is supplied by beautifully crafted and painted game realities.  It's true that the more empty the page, the more room is there for your imagination. Undeniable hard proof of this: Books. Playing a game that e.g. doesn't use much (or any) textures has a stronger otherworldly feel to it than even the most alien but well-textured game, because the latter still says "Natural reality." while the former is by all standards unnatural. Hence the emotions evoked are different and possibly stronger ones. On the other hand, the voice with which the game expresses how its reality works, what cause effect network is at play, is much quieter in less graphically developed games, so the part in your imagination where these meanings gather aren't bombarded with strong statements, there is just insinuation going on, triggering you to fill the gaps yourself. A very extreme example of graphically primitive games in which I personally was able to experience rich emotional content: (free PC implementation of) Mercenary etc. - http://mercenarysite.free.fr/mddclone.htm  Contrary to the above which I thought about often in recent years with better graphics, I have learned to see the benefits of those: If we're just talking landscape (grass etc.), for example, then this is a topic where the imagination of the majority might have made very similar choices except with weaker strength in comparison to what the fully shaped and textured world causes in their heads. *Other* areas of the game could be less explicit, so the player's imagination could be more playful and active, building on the strong emotional fundament of the landscape. But if a game is more elaborate, it usually is so in most of its areas, incl. the texts being spoken by proper actors, so the described scenario happens rarely, or if so, the areas where the player can fill in imagination are few, and maybe this causes them to be less triggered to fill anything in in the first place.  In a way, the difference is really between reading a book and watching a movie. Both have their advantages over the other, and the book guys could certainly call the movie guys lazy and their experience less rich. What their experience otherwise probably is, though is *more intense*.  One thing that's unquestionably objectively true about better modeled and painted game worlds: They contain a lesser *percentage* of interactive objects. Prime example: Doors. Nowadays, it has become *normal* that when you first play a game, you more or less consciously go through the process of learning which style of doors is intended to be purely decorative and which style is interactive (aka gameplay-relevant). Doors are only an example. Just play Deus Ex: Human Revolution and wonder about the interesting decorative but completely not interactive objects placed everywhere. It's like standing in front of a candy store's window as a kid with no money.  It's of course understandable that this is so, but it *is* a negative. Experienced Desktop Publishingers (like me :P) who learn e.g. about layout and typography know that the brain, when in a new "room" (e.g. in a new game), tries to find patterns, and there's a lot of subconscious stuff going on, one that Typographers know needs to be considered even if the person doesn't ever know consciously what it was that made a certain advertisement less attractive to them (e.g. wrong letter spacing, ill-chosen white space on the page, too many fonts, too long text lines).  With this in mind: Realize that if a game world communicates "most of the stuff here is only decorative, and it is now *your work* to distinguish between interactive objects and pure fluff", it breaks the fourth wall, burdens the player unnecessarily, and makes the world unrealistic. Compare that to a less designed world like the procedurally generated ones in Minecraft: Every object you see counts. Most are unimportant because there are so many of them, and there are so many types you personally might not care about (sandstones, flowers, ...), but nothing is facade, everything is real. A dirt block isn't just there to tell a story, it is a block of dirt, and every single one works as your intuition expects it should: The world is real.  I had more on our pattern recognition and the value you see when knowing that every object is somewhat real, that there is no fluff, but I can't concentrate at work right now.
As a theist but fervent religion-hater, I would say "See? It doesn't make any sense!", but people are making a mistake all the time when they make assumptions about God, so that's what I focus on:  "Omnipotence" has, for the longest time (Centuries.) been accepted to refer to "only that which is logically possible". If we assume this kind of omnipotence, then we must submit to the realization that we don't know the true situation God was in when he decided for Creation, we don't even know the true situation right now. So, "why would God ..." and "why didn't he" can't be answered. We can have interesting speculative discussions, but the fact is that we can not find a meaningful answer which we henceforth work with.
Unhelpful rant: It's as stupid as many other websites (though possibly good at what it does, so don't take this as useful critique). Case in point: The front page didn't show me an example of what the site does, so I scrolled to the top and saw the logo "minds alpha". Clicked on it. Was lead to the very same page. When THE GODDAMN EVERLIVING **FUCK** did this shit become the norm, that a page has a big fucking link that leads *to itself*?  Maybe more useful: It's currently slow as fuck. The search. The example blog page I clicked in the search result. Slow bloated shit.
I wouldn't assume that you're a lost cause in this regard. Even if it has been like this for a long time, there is hope that one day your engine starts, and you'll be on a rollercoaster like everybody else (probably partly pretends to be).  Imho you should just be patient and wait. Or maybe you could use some meditation techniques. One I like is to just watch your own mind's actions while trying to fall asleep in the evening. It prolongs the process, but it also has a lot of clean-up effects in the long run.
In general, I would kind of agree, but not only am I not prescribing behavioral changes (It's only an announcement.), but I have the perfect reason for having been mistaken again and again about the actual time when *it will go down*.  The reason is the effective conspiracy of mankind against me. Those who actually *want* to understand will be able to grasp my elaborate explanations in case those are required, but those who are looking for pointers that say "Yep. He's wrong." will find those, definitely. It's in the nature of my being: I grant every and all wishes! Why, you think, *is* the world in such a shitty state? Hence one of the concepts I came up with to keep me afloat is: "The only thing wrong about me is you."
Could you link that? Because you must have misread me, or I had to regard some special circumstances. I would tell everyone ever that I am God all day long, but that's obviously a bad idea. The agenda I have has priority, so I do wear masks. It's all love (The purest. You have no idea.), so a lie is not a crime. But I rather think you misread or are misremembering. In short: I did not just create the universe, but I am "also" God, just in case it was lost.
It's a GTA5 post. OP points out how shitty the wanted-system is and keeps quoting definition file snippets for examples and solutions. Peasant stands in awe.  EDIT: I think "peasantry free" is the right flair, since this guy basically expresses ascension.

"George Clooney Movies - Bu..." This video is no longer available due to a copyright claim by Universal Pictures (ZEFR).   Sorry about that.
A not-true-to-the-novels "Harry Potter - The Beginning", where he discovers his magical nature all on his own, without any interference from the magical society, without living with the idiotic foster family, and the movie ends with Hagrid appearing before Harry without saying a word, credits roll   To get a feel for how this should go, think of the situation in the zoo where Harry accidentally makes the glass of the boa constrictor cage disappear.  http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone CTRL+f "zoo"  The movie/story would just depict part of HP's young life without a distinct story arc behind it, the focus would instead be on what the title says: Situations, and human emotions (kind of the opposite of Hollywoods usual way of dealing with a superhero discovering their powers, which usually rather is like "Umm, ok, I can shoot webs. What's for breakfast?").

A [deleted] post should not have the write-a-comment box. How often have I written something only to throw it away because the post doesn't allow to save the comment!   A reply to comments that are already there works, and hence the reply links should stay. But the main commenting box should go.  Example:  http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1j9bad/what_does_it_take_to_make_an_indie_game/  I searched before posting and saw Raldi's statement in [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/bhpkz/can_we_stop_deleted_posts_from_showing_up_in_the/) thread that such posts are not to show up in the first place and that they'll fix that bug. *That was three years ago.*  Also, what if the post is not yet deleted while it's in the list, but when I click it to see the comments it is?  The only solution is to make the commenting box disappear in those posts.
TERRARIA HUMANUM EST. Just in case that pun  hasn't been made yet, here it is. Maybe it becomes  a slogan or something. (That is all.)   It's a play on [errare humanum est](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/errare%20humanum%20est) - to err is human.
Awesome idea: Want to make a game in Minecraft  and need a variable storing a value, to display that  value to the player, to limit this value from going  too low or too high? All-in-one solution: Pistons  moving a row of glass/nonglass blocks.   **EDIT** I made a quick mock-up of what I mean: **[screenshots](http://i.imgur.com/IgxzJ.jpg)** - It can of course be inverted: Glass being "no value" and some other block (e.g. glowstone, lapis, wool) being the "value" block.  ...  Imagine you look at a flat Minecraft smoothstone wall. There's a few glass blocks from the left to the right, but not to the far right: The rest is, say, cobblestone. Behind the glass (and invisible behind the cobble) is glowstone for effect.  This is your value display. But it's also the stored value itself! Because you can "measure" if position X has currently glass (Doesn't conduct redstone.) or a non-transparent block (Does conduct redstone.)  Also, you can measure if the displayed value currently exceeds an arbitrary X and let an appropriate effect happen (e.g. un-hide a sign saying: "Dude. Too hot, ok?")  The value is increased or decreased by a piston system. The simplest version moves a straight row of 12 blocks (The maximum a piston can move.), so you can display a value of 0 to 6, but you can also go lower by placing obsidian, which pistons can not move. And you can also, somehow, increase the range by some complex measures, but how long a bar graph on the wall do you want to show.  This is a very simple method which solves the following problems:  * You don't have to build a multi-bit register for storing the variable.  * You don't have to build an adder/subtracter.  * You don't have to take care that the variable doesn't exceed its max or min value.  * You don't have to build something that displays the variable value to the player.  **With this idea and the "hide signs behind blocks and only show them when appropriate", which are very simple and very effective, we should soon see quite a few *games within Minecraft*.**
