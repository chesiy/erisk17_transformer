I'd do a lot of the same things I'd do with a duck, it being a fatty bird. The last time I cooked through an entire duck I cooked the following:  Rendered Duck Fat (to make anything you'd need fat in--eggs, biscuits, etc) Duck Confit (shred off the bone + add to whatever--you can even make nuggets :) or a shepards pie style dish ) Pate Broth

Thank you! My fridge could use some more Sounders swag though
It's delicious! I have to admit... The only sujuk I've had is the one I've made at home.   The jist of it is it's a basic beef blend with red wine, garlic, paprika, etc but I think the flavor you're referring to is fenugreek! It's super yummy and is that X factor is sausages usually.
the cookies are not a lie

I am looking for two Saturday tickets! I have Friday tickets, but I am a HUGE conner and would be super bummed to only go one day. I unfortunately lived 3000 miles away when I initially bought my ticket on a hunch I'd be back East by now...  Get me two Saturday tickets and I can throw you some swag I have leftover from my days working at Marvel. Or a carrot cake. Or some nice beer--your choice!
yes please!
he ate 4 sooooooooooooo
