Anytime. Honestly I rarely comment on these at all. You have no reason to have low confidence. Just diet at a surplus, hit the gym, and then jaws hit the floor. You have great style too. You a natural redhead?
To clarify, the first pic compared to last pic is your progress? And what weight did you start at? Plus, what are your goals?  If so, and your goal of to get big and cut, yes, it's bad progress. Really bad. You may have defined out a bit, but you need to get significantly bigger so bulking is a must. It seems you don't have the diet in order at all. You need to eat at a large caloric surplus to gain weight and it doesn't look like you have been doing that. Simply just working out doesn't cut it, diet is just as vital as training. So I think you just need to her serious about your diet.
That was fucking hilarious
I agree that his economic stance is just horrendous - but I really don't think Paul has a good chance at winning, and my ONLY reason for thinking that is because he'll be running under the republican ticket. The republican party has done a well and thorough job of making themselves look even worse than the democrats, which is his downfall.   They control congress so it's not out of question. However the dems seem to be the sexier party nowadays. It's unfortunate honestly, because Rand, Justin Amash, and Thomas Massie are very good Republicans. Bernie is the only Dem I see that is making waves with integrity. Hillary will win the primary, she'll go against bush and a battle of legacy will ensue, Hillary will win. Or against Walker and Hillary will still win because he is just a run of the mill republican and the country won't vote for that.  Well, a candidate needs funds to get the message out there. Many times have otherwise good candidates been outspent by horrible candidates that take tons of money.
Holy shit.
It's unfortunate, and isn't an indicator. But that was the thought process back in the day, and reverence to god *does* generally help build good men as a foundation for quality character, I think that's the main thought process.   I straight up told them I wasn't sure about religion or god, they told me that's fine you're young. 9 times out of 10 they will find an excuse to pass you as long as you aren't callus about it. They know it's kind of a stupid rule, but religion is integral to scouting.
It got a more intense and out of hand then it should have and I apologize about that. I told him at the beginning of the night if we were going to discuss it, it should be done later in a private party. Won't happen again when we play. But to be fair, it was egged on a bit at the beginning.
The face he's making is punchable. But other than that he looks like a normal dude. Everyone can make punchable faces
Awesome. Thanks man. I'll take this into account.
I shoulda put the /s. But we really aren't that obese. We aren't even in the top 10, or 20, or even 30 most obese countries in the world.
That was great. To add, maybe ONI isn't the bad guy in these situations or even halo 5. Think, they might have done some horrible things. But what are they doing now that they haven't been doing before? Generally, for what they believe, is the greater good. Now we have something intentionally stirring up chaos and the biggest scandal in human history.   It seems that someone or something may be trying to weaken humanity as a whole by causing dissent within the ranks of the UNSC, and stirring more people towards the innie cause then ever before. All while the Covenant is reforming under Jul for the sole purpose of destroying humanity. Now we have a flood return? So then the question remains, who is behind all of this?  Absolute. Fucking. ***CHAOS***
This is absolutely amazing. It's super dark. As a listener, you don't know what to believe. Do you believe chief had a reason? Or that he went off the chain and derailed legitimate peace talks? Is chief a hero or a legitimate traitor? Even as listeners now, we have no idea. Before, we were sure chief had his reasons.   It looks at the spartan program and ONI from a different light. We see how people view the chief and the political climate of humanity. Locke finally has justification for his mission. Humanity will be thrust into chaos, and will be pushed to the brink of destruction once more.
Because it'll probably suck. Sorry :/
I must say though. I quite enjoyed the movie.
Pretty. Keep the dark hair, goes great with your eyes. But going to need more pics in a different pose. 7.5/10
And super cool shit that's otherwise rare and hard to do.  Like this.
Yup. Honestly, that game is the shit. It's current competitive settings (MLG V7) are probably the best iteration out of any halo. The custom games community is flourishing because of how customizable forge and games are, the campaign and customization options are great. Plus the file browser makes it easy to find maps, games, and other community creations.   It had so much potential if it had only launched with better maps, and the TU settings.
Id vote for you.
That was absolutely incredible. After reading the lines from H3 terminals, it just screams the old plan of "humans were forerunners".  So to sum this up a bit more. Humanity is facing:   - Rebellion and dissent within its military and outer colonies  - Flood's possible return. And in heavy numbers  - Jul and Halsey (whom are both hellbent on revenge) have the Janus key and every piece of forerunner tech.   - plus, a fuckton of Promethean knights at their disposal and the manipulative covie religion is on the rise.   - John is AWOL at a time that is arguably **more threatening then the human covie war**. Humanities greatest hero abandoned them when they needed him most.
That's amazing.
Bro. You forgot to label that weird space in between the phone pillow/awkward blanket, and SO. Looks like a good 1 to 2 feet gap there
So this is no longer a debate on the logical legitimacy of him as a GOP candidate. And is now about his political views, opinions, and philosophies. As such we'd be debating and advocating certain policies and the reasoning behind why something should or should not happen.  As much as I could debate and refute everything you're saying, I simply have no time or interest in getting into a long drawn out and useless internet debate about fiscal matters and other opposing viewpoints.
Lmao.
You're definitely not ugly.
Redheads. Yes.
GOD DAMIT. I didn't really want her involved.   Edit: Damn. I got negged to shit. They killed her off in halo 4 in an epic way. It would be cheap to bring her back and make the whole reason chief went AWOL, and by extension Locke's mission about cortana. So we're going to spend  that whole campaign hunting chief or playing as chief......   for cortana. Come on. That's so cheap and predictable
At least that was black and white. Shoot the big blargy aliens. It was an epic struggle.   But if the UNSC and humanity are flung into a legitimate civil war, the floods possible return, Halsey/Jul with the Janus Key, and covie religion making a comeback. I'd say that's pretty bad. But I doubt it'll happen
- HCS is rising and the competitive scene is beginning to rise again - Lore has been handled wonderfully with books, comics, and merch. - Halo is gaining more content creators, YouTubers, and fan sites. Compared to the dying of Reach and 4 - Halo 5 is looking extremely promising so far. From a story perspective and MP - MCC is functional, 343 is working around the clock to bring the next TU. - no longer is this sub and every halo forum filled with anti 343 circle jerk. We are seeing discussion, awesome clips and more.   Halo isn't dad. We just have to accept that halo isn't the top dog mainstream game anymore. And work to be a friendly community newcomers want to be apart of.
I could remove myself the situation, but it wouldn't make logical sense to do so. My issue isn't with paying taxes altogether, it's when the government spends it on stupid shit that detriments the nation. I shouldn't have to move to a third world country to avoid paying the money the government uses to blow billions of dollars.   What he is saying is like saying: "if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear"
Feels.
Spartan Ops return in halo 5?   I'd personally love it. If they actually continued it and did various seasons, 343 could cover many aspects of the universe such as playing as an ODST or marine, Human - forerunner war. They could even go back and make a mission based around ghosts of onyx or any other book.   Imagine playing Sgt Johnson during the battle of harvest. It would be fucking awesome. The whole episodic campaign thing is a great idea if they made it more campaign like, less firefighty, and 25 episodes per season. Probably a long shot but they could contract episodes to saber and cutscenes to blur.   343 pls
