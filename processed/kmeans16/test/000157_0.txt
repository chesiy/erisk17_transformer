There are very many things in this world that never should have happened. But yet they did, and here we are.
No, that is not a bad thing. It is the general discussion of the matter that will bring out everything that needs to be considered to do it right. As you have pointed out, if we tilt the scales without providing the environment for and skills that will allow people to break into entrepreneurial endeavors, then we will have a catastrophe as you pointed out.  So your points and concerns are actually very well founded and important sir/madam.
There is no where in the world that says this is what financial aid should be. You describe the status quo, which is broken. For a civilized country, a well educated citizenry is the only way to remain civilized. This is the primary role/function of any state. It is the very reason for its existence!  edit: primary 'rule' - primary role/function
You're not entitled to making or fabricating hypothetical interpretations where there are facts. According to the accounts Joseph owned his own shop. So hinting that he 'could have been employed by someone else' is just making things up. But you can maintain your opinion, you are free to have them. Just pointing out that it is wrong.
Yay!
This is humbling to read. Sometimes you come across stories and experiences that remind you of just how little you 'know' about life. Thank you for sharing.  Things like this will be helpful to know as a parent raising a female child. Not so much to protect but to be of some sensible support and compass through it all.
Been there. Understand and appreciate your being candid. My initial comment was a FTFY. Well, one way of looking at it is that we both agree the current 'trend' is broken since, in a healthy society, we should be appalled by any acts of cruelty and senseless violence towards any living creature.  That the media pushes this or that idea is one thing. This however, is reddit. "We" shape the conversation as it should be.

Genetics and interracial offspring
Well, is have to kill you first. But then, the next guy would also require proof. And since you no longer have a physical body with which to communicate, you can't tell him otherwise. For me it makes more sense since it explains much of the suffering that happens in the world. The way I see it, you have 3 choices: 1. Complete randomness. Which actually doesn't exist since everything has some mathematical it logical prices. 2. The Christian version of a God, who acts arbitrarily. See ops post. 3. Or some well defined laws that govern everything. Including the cycle of human existence which includes birth, death, and rebirth. Having to pay for every single act that you put out.
Because, you know, since they lied about how they murdered him in cold blood, they couldn't possibly be lying about that. You only get one lie pet incident, right?
Pope calls for end to fossil fuels
Or put your money where your mouth is and stop feeding the beast. Each day we read about corporate practices we don't like and still consume, directly or indirectly, and invest in the these same corporations. Why?
Sounds wonderful. I rejoice with you friend. Now, don't mess it up :)
Nigeria Steps Up Aid for Rescued Captives. Please help too.
Here is a thought: Nothing in my post here indicated or alluded to anything of 'sexual' intercourse, which is purely a physical affair. It is only hear on earth, on this material plane where sexual intercourse is to be found. It is also on this plane that you will find sexual organs for reproduction. This can not be difficult to understand. So, once again, if you understand that there is no occurrence of this on other parts of creation, then it is logical to conclude that differences arising from activity related to physical activity will not exist either. This does not contradict anything of what I have said. It does however, highlight the need for me to state explicitly that I am referring here to spiritual activity. It is in the nature of this spiritual activity that certain physical changes occur. That is, if a person of female gender distorts herself, then this will have damages that will eventually manifest in some later physical part that renders the person useless both spiritually and physically. Which is an ejection mechanism in creation that you can clearly observe everywhere if you look for it.
