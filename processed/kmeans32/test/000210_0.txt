His last interview. RIP https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zRFnw4jOU
This video is satire.
Power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts...absolutely.  Centralized power leads to absolute power.
Even Harvard business review thinks the conspiracy to turn reddit in a venture capital cash cow is a stupid idea.
Yep.  "Learned helplessness" is not something the average uses of reddit is good at. F the gatekeepers. Have you seen the new "content policy".
TIL that the new reddit CEO is going to get rid off free speech and it's "dark side" to make this website a safe space for corporate advertisers.

I have invented a new method to treat my reoccurring MRSA superbug infections and I am giving away idea patent-free.

/u/ProtoDong I contacted the moderators from /r/conspiracy about your rude language and trolling behavior. I don't want your posts deleted. I just requested that you and your trolling buddies leave me alone. Go back to /r/technology. This is the conspiracy subreddit. So leave me alone. Ok. Buddy. From proud Veteran.
I think you are wrong but even if you are correct. I don't care. It is call empathy. When the law become lawless you must break it. I don't  care about your fear tactics. Go troll some place else. Quit pretending  you care about me. If I go too jail so be it. If you want to have an intelligent coversation of why I am wrong I am all ears. Name calling doesn't prove you know what you are talking about.
My naval education background from 2.5 years of electronics schools which are all MIT based and taught by lockheed Martin instructors gave me an educational backround which helped me come up with idea. Plus I am a strange nerd. On my spare time, I read peer reviewed scientific papers on all subjects. It's fun.Proud Veteran. Have a problem with it. Your problem.
On my youtube channel there is my half-finished patent-free mrsa infection prototype medicial machine. I have spent over $2,000 of my own money building it. I am giving idea away patent and compensation free. I do not work for any company but rather understand the pain this flesh eating disease brings. It's called empathy folks. Something some of the nasty people on r/technology don't understand. If you don't agree with me downvote me.
Maybe.
Give me a minute. I will provide links. Also my friend is a retired microbiologist. I have a youtube video where he comments on my mrsa treatment idea
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca6x4QbpoM This will answer your questions.

The common assumption is that man domesticated wolf's not that man and wolf affected each others evolution.  We would not even be the same form most likely if it wasn't for dogs and wolfs. Some even go so far as to think that wolf domesticated man not vise versa. I would not go this far. I think we domesticated each other.
Thanks for input. I am going to try to cut down my coffee to a couple of cups a day and drink more water. This is not going to be easy but I hope this help because kidney stones are aweful.
He is currently died but his words live on. RIP.
My dogs are littermates so they are real protective of each other and me at the dog park. Crazy little guys. They have the small dog napoleon complex.
I used a combination treatment of 400nm blue spectrum light from a hydroponic grow bulb, a topicial mixture of bezethonium cloride and epson salt, and alternation hot and cold. Each of these ideas have some known medicial benefit and are covered in peer reviewed scientific papers. My idea was to combine all three and get the 400nm blue spectrum light from a 1000 watt hydroponic grow bulb. Treated my last three MRSA infections  this way.
Dark triad personality people think normal emotionally healthy people are fools. What they don't realize is that they are the ones who are emotionally defective not humanity.  Sure the dark trial is better than average with logic but the universe is not governed solely by linear cause and effect logic. The emotion of love transcends logic.
Good response. I should have made question with out serious.  I think maybe our universe it connected to a black hole of parent universe. Not sure. Just crazy idea
Language is flawed.
Good one.

Many people say " I don't do anything wrong so why should I care". There was a film about east germany when it was communist. In the movie, one of the local party bosses had the hots for the wife of one of the films characters . He told the secret service to spy on him to find some "dirt" on him so he could lock him up and have his way with his wife. He couldn't find anything so he used the private information of his phone conversations to frame him.  " Power corrupts" and " absolute power corrupts absolutely ". So get a warrent unless you want to live in a police state. If you don't think this couldn't happen in the United States your fooling yourself. Would you like all your phone calls keep in a central database where even your local sheriff could listen to them. This is where this is heading in the future if not stopped.
