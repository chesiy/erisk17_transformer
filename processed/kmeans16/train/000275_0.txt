I just bought a pair of white color size medium about a half hour ago, maybe its just certain size/color combinations that are sold out.
Saw this in the store a couple months back
A little back information: my Dad and Grandma were notorious for playing pranks on each other when they'd visit each other, putting stuff on each other's face while they slept, my dad hid a full bag of trash in her car when she went on a trip back home, etc. Well it was Christmas in like '97-'98(I was about 9) and we had received a package from Grandma and were supposed to open it on Christmas Eve. We open it to see a bunch of what look like gourmet chocolates, so we all enjoy the evening and each the chocolates without anyone noticing. We get a call from our family who lives near my Grandma and they're just laughing it up and barking throughout the entire conversation, come to find out that she ate all the actual chcolates and dipped dog food bits in chocolate and repackaged the box. Come to find out, apparently chocolate covered dog food isn't that bad tasting.

This one was the only one we had a hard time with because he had such a good personality and we got attached but the others haven't been bad. We've fostered probably 10 now.
Thanks, appreciate it
