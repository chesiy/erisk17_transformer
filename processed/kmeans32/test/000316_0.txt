Cocaine is a helluva drug

This is a perfect depiction of the united states under the GOP threat. Class warfare, abysmal treatment of those who do the fucking work. I'm past the point for having pity for the stupid fucks who vote GOP. Now I consider them part of the threat.
Yep. It's my fucking empty bag you just told me to put there, slower cousin of Siri. :P
4-Year-Old Fatally shoots self with unsecured gun
Car window shattered Sunday on I-25 in Weld County
Really, if someone attacks him politically I'd be baffled as to why; he was a fairly well-rounded guy and had pretty much something that everyone could admire, IMO.
The fact that this guy shot each person twice makes me think this is a "2A" nutter making a statement. Also, seems the two shot were almost exactly a month apart. Trying out my nancy drew hat, hoping they find him before the next one. My brother takes the exit where the girl was shot almost nightly for work, and living with this gun terrorism is unacceptable. Either stop the nutters from getting weapons or stop everyone, we don't need to be taken out like target practice as we take our kids to school and go to work.
There's a strange self-flagellation in America where people almost gag-reflex statements about why things can't be nicer / better / more effective here like other places. Fuck that shit. If you can't see a better future, go work on your imagination. Don't poison the environment with blanket denial based on pessimism. I'm all for input based in fact, but if you just come to say vague negatives for why berries specific suggestions aren't for us, g'wan now.
A woman had a bullet in her neck, the third of 7 shattered window incidents. Have you got a source that this is not bullets? Do share if so. Otherwise all accounts point to an ammosexual.

Gun control: The gun control that works: no guns
A man who declined to be identified told a Reuters photographer that a teenaged girl in a nightgown came to his house, running barefoot through a snowy wooded area and crying that her parents had been shot. They called police and law enforcement officials found her parents dead at their home.  Authorities said they later discovered five other people dead and a wounded woman in three other houses. The woman, who is expected to recover, gave them information about the shooter, Texas County Sheriff James Sigman said.  Four of the victims were identified as Garold Aldridge, 52, his wife Julie Aldridge, 47, Harold Aldridge, 50, and his wife Janell Aldridge, 48.  Authorities would not identify the other victims, but the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that they were Carey Shriver and his wife Valirea Shriver, and Carey's father Darrell Shriver. Darrell's wife Martha was wounded but survived, the paper said.

That picture reads like something out of a trailer park or an open carry Texas rally. Teabillies are the same all over the world!
Same here. I thought of my own child when he accidentally spills something and says "Sorry mom, I spilled my drink"...and how this kid said "I'm sorry, Mom. I shot Corbin."   The adults surrounding those two boys failed them both. I hope the five year old gets massive support and counseling, but I fear that's not something you ever get over. God damnit.
Panic buttons coming to Texas House after open carry confrontation
Fairly sure the three older siblings who witnessed it will end up cluing him in. All four kids witnessed the shooting. From the articles I've read it sounds like there are guns everywhere in this family. Hoping law enforcement at the very least removes the guns from the home, since they clearly put the children at risk.
It's abhorrent. As a parent in the US, I am uncomfortable sending my child anywhere without a drastic change to our lack of gun regulation. We lose an average of 82 citizens a day to gun violence.   [Each year, more than 30,000 Americans die in gun suicides, homicides, and unintentional shootings as a result of the ready availability, and accessibility, of specific classes of firearms. Gun violence is more than a crime issue; it is a broad-based public health crisis of which crime is merely the most recognized aspect.](http://www.vpc.org/aboutvpc.htm)

Three-year-old Colorado girl shot by 5-year-old boy wielding mothers boyfriends handgun
Yes, and what if the entrance was surrounded by anti-gun protestors yelling at you to reconsider your decision, for fear someone might die, and holding huge posters with dead people killed by bullets?
As we saw in the Santa Barbara massacre, the parents tried to warn cops but they needed access to his home. Now, a law is being passed so that concern IS the justifiable cause. This may help.   I always hear that people don't want laws because law abiding citizens follow them and criminals don't. However, if we make selling a handgun without a background check illegal, all that does is put the good guys on notice to run background checks to ensure they aren't selling to a bad guy - which happens! Felons buy guns without background checks right now. One way or another we need that to end. If a GGWAG is selling in a private transaction and runs a background check and the buyer is a felon, the GGWAG has just potentially saved lives. I'll never get why someone who is supposedly a good guy gun owner would be against that.

Denver shooting leaves two men critical, woman injured
No, it doesn't matter if we know the name of the shooter. What matters is that he was known to be totally unbalanced and disturbed, yet was able to legally buy a fuckload of guns and ammo, and then keep those even when cops checked on him after tips that he was going to go off. What the actual fuck? Stop letting crazy people buy and own guns. Period.
