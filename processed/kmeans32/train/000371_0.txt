What tea will you be drinking?
My mother bought a poster of it from the British Library which is now framed.  I believe it is the same as the one on sale at the Bodleian's own shop: http://www.bodleianshop.co.uk/catalogsearch/result/?q=Tolkein+poster. It's a good reproduction if it's the same one - though I can't be 100% because the dark border isn't visible in the one in my home. It could have been cut off though.
weren't enough Anglo-Saxons to completely dominate the native gene pool  This article goes into more detail:   * ['Myths of British ancestry' by Stephen Oppenheimer in *Prospect* magazine](http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/features/mythsofbritishancestry)  But **the English still derive most of their current gene pool from the same early Basque source as the Irish, Welsh and Scots**. These figures are at odds with the modern perceptions of Celtic and Anglo-Saxon ethnicity based on more recent invasions. There were many later invasions, as well as less violent immigrations, and each left a genetic signal, but no individual event contributed much more than 5 per cent to our modern genetic mix.  More data for those interested can be found here:  * ['The Fine-Scale Genetic Structure of the British Population' - the results of a 20 year study, published in *Nature*](http://www.nature.com/articles/nature14230.epdf?referrer_access_token=wKgXQpHeV9hW7vEu63f_AdRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0MiE0_B2kFTYAb64eH_EPxJeiJzg7Mfl6MEBC6p_EUzUubrkOhRuO_XsZgBdONzb7JHIJr0qWq47bqvybwXlZOl6rT8e6_ZLRFU5Y1Usu-VzWwuPgZJTD4dXKpUe-mYsGEs0ilrxQAsV2B2ul0r6xu3s_FYkniPrbpBXUL0BRfdVSTwUmzwczIBMq4BOd92qWIbb9YOg3Tcn-l4GUTiaSbT tracking_referrer=www.theguardian.com).  * ['Genetic history of the British and the Irish' entry on the Eupedia European genetics site](http://www.eupedia.com/genetics/britain_ireland_dna.shtml).  * ['Genetics and the Anglo-Saxon Invasion' essay by Erik Grigg of the University of Manchester](http://www.academia.edu/2607635/Genetics_and_the_Anglo-Saxon_Invasion).

'We use the words other animals or non-human animals in our language to acknowledge that humans are animals too; a fact often ignored by those who benefit from exploiting other animals. We share more with other animals than most of us realise or would admit.' - The Vegan Society   Extracted from the following factsheet from the Vegan Society: https://www.vegansociety.com/sites/default/files/CompassionForAnimals.pdf
Well it was made from the regions here I think http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/was/wealth-in-great-britain-wave-3/2010-2012/report--chapter-2--total-wealth.html#tab-Household-total-wealth-by-key-household-characteristics  So Wales was only included as one region so it was shrunk rather than having its dimensions distorted.

Thank you very much. I gave those a read. I've also just come across *Fools and Jesters in Literature, Art, and History A Bio-Bibliographical Sourcebook* edited by Vicki K. Janik which looks like it should be a very informative read. I'll give Christopher Moore's *Fool* a look too.
That site is terrible for pop-ups, I grant you. I watched the whole of *Samsara* with a hellacious, heavy metal soundtrack in the background. I thought it was part of the film. It was just the music from an unnoticed pop-up in a different tab.  I hope you manage to see it. Perhaps try again or using a different device if you can.
At least 44 Conservative candidates in the 130 seats that will decide the election have either worked for banks and other finance companies or accepted political donations from them.   Quoted from [Sunday Times article '1 in 3 Tories in key seats has links to banks.'](http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/article1503047.ece)  Rehosted at Pastebin here: http://pastebin.com/epbFZBFn
Thank you very much. That makes a lot of sense. Yes it was chewy and meat-like. I had a hunch they were made of wheat gluten - that's why I was keen to try making it myself because I had bought a pack of vital wheat gluten when making a recipe calling for seitan. I was just perplexed that the only results I got when searching 'Jai Yun' was for a restaurant in San Francisco.   What would you say are the main difficulties in trying to cook it oneself?
I've just received the following email from someone at Coursera  Thanks for contacting us and for your patience while we investigate your issue!  I can confirm that Buddhist Meditation and the Modern World will start on June 15th 2015. We sincerely apologize if the change in course dates caused any disruption to your schedule. We thank you in advance for your understanding, and we look forward to having you join us again in June 2015!  Best,  Eddie  I was going to respond with a similar wise-crack on non-attachment but you've beaten me to it. A chance for me to practise noble silence then.
So your 11pm figure was a bit off, wasn't it? On balance and in the round I think the changes would be a very sensible thing.   Look at the charts at the bottom of this page to see how many more hours of sun the changes would provide: http://www.lighterlater.org/benefits.html.  The UK isn't nearly as blessed as Portugal is in these matters.
Well...   (BTW, we should all be alarmed by anyone wishing to do away with the human rights act. ['The Human Rights Act - What's Not To Love?'](http://emilypondblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/the-human-rights-act-what-s-not-to-love2.png))
[Think what you like about his policies, his was my favourite ever episode of Desert Island Discs that I have listened to.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00xgs41) I thought he came across as a man of principle and passion , yet moreover, humanity and decency.
Thank you.

Very well said.
I googled a name at random off that CID document. He still upheld his testimony in an interview in 2010.   More convincingly, the book *Torture and Democracy* by Darius Rejali contains the following passage in the Appendix - 'A Note on Sources for American Torture during the Vietnam War':  Furthermore, during the 2004 presidential campaign, conservative groups put a great deal of energy into finding anyone who would discredit the Winter Soldier investigations. If, as Lewy insists, there were veterans who were outraged that someone used their name falsely to make claims of atrocities in Vietnam, this was the time for them to have come forward. But by the end of fall 2004, only one soldier came forward, Steven J. Pitkin.^62 If Pitkins account is true, it does not fit the allegations in the NIS file. Pitkin does not state someone impersonated him at Winter Soldier; rather he retracts the account he offered there. So where were the several soldiers whose were so outrageously impersonated at Winter Soldier? And where was the African American who had received help from the Nation of Islam in preparing his testimony?   There are also troubling questions about the Pitkin affidavit. Pitkin apparently filed his affidavit twice. His first affidavit was filed on August 31, 2004, and it was immediately contested. Another veteran, Scott Camil, filed his own affidavit on September 11, 2004, pointing to falsehoods in the Pitkin affidavit.^63 Pitkin subsequently filed a new affidavit on September 15, 2004. This new affidavit was surprising in its own right since his close friend from the 1970S, Nancy Miller Saunders, believed he was dead.^64 At any rate, Pitkins new affidavit states that he falsely described incidents of rape, brutality, atrocities and racism at the urging of presidential candidate John Kerry.^65

This can't just sound a little fishy to me.  Yes. You are not alone.
You like animals. (And I thought this before I even saw your username) You are sexually adventurous.   edit: went on your profile to see if I was right about the latter and discovered that I think I was spot on with the former.

Does it? Also, saying how I 'differentiate video games from other forms of entertainment' wouldn't be required to make a valid and sound argument that video games are a waste of time.
I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and presume you're a troll.
a) The science seems to state that video games do have a negative effect - http://www.psychology.iastate.edu/faculty/caa/abstracts/2010-2014/10ASISBSRS.pdf. Read that and see if you then disagree.   b) Other things being bad does not mean that video games are good.  c) I think you missed some of the subtlety of my original explicatory comment. I said that any good engendered by games is nullified by the pallid tone in which they cast 'reality'. Perhaps you'd like to tell me more about Spec Ops. My prejudices are telling me that, going on the first two words alone, the game is not one made by a devotee of Francis of Assisi or the Lord Buddha! Please disabuse me.
You truly don't see this?  Yes. It might help you to understand where I'm coming from if I told you that I'm beyond Good and Evil inasmuch as I think instead in regards to that which is *kusala* and *akusala* or 'skillful' and 'unskillful'. The idea that some people know more and are wiser than others is non-negotiable and incontrovertible to my mind.  Relevant:   "Abandon what is unskillful, monks. It is possible to abandon what is unskillful. If it were not possible to abandon what is unskillful, I would not say to you, 'Abandon what is unskillful.' But because it is possible to abandon what is unskillful, I say to you, 'Abandon what is unskillful.' If this abandoning of what is unskillful were conducive to harm and pain, I would not say to you, 'Abandon what is unskillful.' But because this abandoning of what is unskillful is conducive to benefit and pleasure, I say to you, 'Abandon what is unskillful.'  "Develop what is skillful, monks. It is possible to develop what is skillful. If it were not possible to develop what is skillful, I would not say to you, 'Develop what is skillful.' But because it is possible to develop what is skillful, I say to you, 'Develop what is skillful.' If this development of what is skillful were conducive to harm and pain, I would not say to you, 'Develop what is skillful.' But because this development of what is skillful is conducive to benefit and pleasure, I say to you, 'Develop what is skillful.'"
