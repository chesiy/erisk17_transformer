Mechanism discovered for snake fungal disease with near 100% mortality rate; findings could eventually help protect endangered species
It would be interesting to know, though, if there enough homology of brain structure and function that common language strategies are likely to emerge, even if language wasn't part of the ancestral state.  Even if bird and human communication systems are an example of convergent evolution, understanding more about birdsong and how it evolved can still reveal a lot about how evolution shapes communication systems, and the general principles of how those systems arise.
Here is what the authors of the original study say: "Many studies have found structural alterations in various subcortical brain regions in MDD. To date, volumetric differences have not always been consistent and are poorly replicated for some regions; moreover, sample sizes are often small, limiting the power to detect subtle brain differences."  This study was a meta-analysis that re-examined the data from many other studies, to try to draw broader conclusions about what regions of the brain are structurally altered in depression.  They also say: "Clearly, there is a continued need for longitudinal studies tracking hippocampal volume changes over the disease course, to further elucidate whether hippocampal abnormalities result from prolonged duration of chronic stress (that is, scarring), represent a vulnerability factor for MDD, or both."  In other words, this quote from the beginning of the linked press article is just completely wrong: "Brain damage is caused by persistent depression rather than being a predisposing factor for it, researchers have finally concluded after decades of unconfirmed hypothesising."  I don't know why they quote the coauthor Hickie in a way that contradicts the published research, or why they misspell "hypothesizing," but it seems like a case of poor journalism.
I think a tattoo is plenty noticeable, but as you note, information can change.  Phone numbers, but also your medical needs or history could eventually change; you might want someone other than your parents as an emergency contact, etc.
I think Dirk Gently is fantastic, and I've never heard of Last Chance to See!  I'm excited to go find it now.
In addition to what /u/skgoa said, both types of information transmittal that you described occur in the nervous system.  The action potential fired by a neuron is stereotyped, always the same, but some sensory neurons do represent the magnitude of a stimulus (such as pressure) by increasing their frequency of firing, as you describe in your question. If I'm remembering my basic neuroscience correctly, in many cases this happens on a log scale--e.g. a stimulus 10x stronger would induce 2x increase in firing rate.  In addition, dedicated neurons and neuronal circuits detect specific types of stimuli.  Light pressure would be detected by pressure sensory neurons in the skin; heavy pressure might also activate pain neurons, and the resulting subjective experience would be painful pressure.

This is a really complex task; we are still in the process of learning what functions proteins perform, what genes code for those proteins, how variations in gene sequence and other DNA sequence affect gene expression and protein function, etc.  However, this is something that forensic scientists, geneticists, and others have been working on in humans and a few other animals, with some success: http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22129613.600-genetic-mugshot-recreates-faces-from-nothing-but-dna.html#.VZMA8kZdq2U  In agricultural research, researchers are also working on predicting certain traits of interest from DNA sequence alone, such as milk production in cows, yield or stress tolerance in crop plants, etc.   Adding a bit of specificity after checking my facts.  Right now for humans, we can predict skin tone pretty well, and a few other traits with some accuracy (hair and eye color, hair texture, height, facial structure as above) but far from perfectly. As I said above, these areas are actively improving.  Reference: "Forensic DNA Phenotyping: Predicting human appearance from crime scene material for investigative purposes."  So, right now, probably not for most organisms, or sort of for humans.  In the future (10-20 years) probably much better, at least for humans and organisms "of interest".
Fair point, I have not.  Briefly stated, my issue with ASOIAF (I actually read all the books so far, in a really over the top attempt to give them a fair shake and understand why my BF likes them) is not the violence per se, although I know this is the issue for many who dislike them.  It's that although the plot is exciting and full of cliff-hangers, I just don't get the sense of a lot of thought or meaning behind them.  No genuine reflection on human nature, philosophy, or the way the world works.  If characters die, it shouldn't be as a "gotcha" at the reader.  If a despicable character suddenly shows a more empathetic side, it should feel genuine, not like a plot twist for the sake of surprise.  This might be unfair to Martin, it's just my subjective experience.  Are his short stories substantially different in style?  If it's just that novel-writing or sudden mega-fame changed his writing a lot, I'd be interested to give them a shot just for the heck of it.
In general, yup, that is the theory.  The idea is that there's a sort of "natural selection" for synapses in the brain--connections that are used often are maintained, and those that are not used often will eventually weaken and disappear.  This is even more true in developing brains, but even in adult brains, new possible connections are continually being formed, and then either discarded or retained depending on how active they are.
"Done because we are too meny"
This RadioLab segment talks about what the original form of life was probably like: a big collective swamp of semi-living, self-reproducing chemicals.  https://www.wnyc.org/radio/#/ondemand/91602  Edit to add a little more detail: researchers are still trying to understand exactly how the transition from non-living to living happened, or even exactly how to define non-living and living in that transitional period.

Animals probably don't know consciously whether another animal is an herbivore or a carnivore.  Also, they probably don't have reason to.  It might often be true that herbivores are good targets for predation, it's not universally true (eg, porcupines.)  Carnivores do probably either learn (as individuals) or evolve (as a population) to prefer animals that are easier prey, as well as those that provide them with the nutrients they need the most: "Do wild carnivores forage for prey or for nutrients?: Evidence for nutrient-specific foraging in vertebrate predators." http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25767065
An alternative to drug-sniffing dogs: Honey bees can be trained to detect pure heroin
In theory, and in a very simplistic way, yes; supporting the life of the most important pollinating bees would contribute to more efficient pollination of crops (assuming that one was focusing on the right species in the right geographical regions, close enough to where crops are grown, etc.)  In practice, there are two major points.  One is that none of these bees are honey bees, Apis mellifera, the type of bee that most people imagine raising and maintaining.  For the purpose of the research done in this paper, honey bees were excluded because many of them are not "wild", and the researchers wanted to focus exclusively on wild bees.  Almost all of the species they looked at are not typically reared by humans, and none are "domesticated" to the extent that bees are.  Additionally, the majority of bee species in the world, and many examined in this research, are not "social," that is, they do not live in colonies.  They are solitary.  That doesn't really matter to answer your question, I am just too much of a nerd not to share!  If you are interested in supporting bee populations though, there are lots of ways to do that less directly, including protecting whatever parts of the environment specific types of bees live in, planting bee-friendly plants to ensure that they have season-long access to food (instead of having no food whenever local crops are not in bloom), etc.
