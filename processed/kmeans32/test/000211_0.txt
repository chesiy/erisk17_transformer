Sandra Bland dashcam arrest video released
Omg, I interviewed with these guys too! I don't think it's a pyramid scheme necessarily, but it is shady. The person I spent a day with actually laid out the strategy, but I forgot the parent company name.
Israel has repeatedly stated that they hold Hamas, as the purported governing body of Gaza, responsible for all attacks that originate from the territory. As you can see from the year after the war (September through May, at least) you can see that Hamas can indeed control when rockets are being fired or not, even if they are not directly participating.  The point is that there was an effective 19-month ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, which Israel broke, leading to a war in which 67 Israelis died.  Unless of course you hold the easily defensible position that the kidnapping of the three teens by Hamas operatives was in itself an attack by Hamas, thus breaking the ceasefire themselves.  Or the previous opinion, that since Hamas controls the Gaza Strip, every rocket fired is in itself a violation of the ceasefire, whether Hamas does it themselves or not.   [Especially when the text of the ceasefire in 2012 states plainly that rockets attacks from **all Palestinian factions**, will cease.](http://www.jpost.com/Defense/Text-of-Israel-Hamas-cease-fire-agreement)
Thanks! Here's my list from before, revised with the patch updates:  **Important:**  * Fix fall damage! Make it less, automatic roll, etc. Maybe a potion. We should be able to jump from heights like in the Witcher 1 intro video. * ~~More key bindings, fix some of the ones available. For example, right now sheath and dive can only use the same button if you keep the default.~~ FIXED, STILL NEEDS WORK. The biggest issue is the hardcoded bindings while in the menu * ~~Swimming Controls~~ FIXED, TESTED * Horse Controls (ex. doesnt stop randomly, reliably navigate around objects, automatic jumping over low barriers) SOMEWHAT FIXED * **Storage**: Please give innkeepers stashes like in the two previous games, or maybe a 'Travelers Storage chest' at all inns so we don't have to talk to someone to access our stuff. There are many options for this, but I would like to have all the types of witcher armor and swords available somewhere, though not necessarily on me. Maybe Roach should be a storage chest? * More options, especially for potions and bombs, in the quick access wheel, like this: http://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/374d3l/anyone_else_wish_they_had_something_like_this/[3]. This isn't necessarily the answer, but applying oils, switching bombs, and drinking potions is cumbersome right now. It would be alleviated somewhat with extra tabs (see below), but not entirely.  **Combat:**  * Jump while in combat * It seems that if the sword is out, all other items deal ~ as much damage. Is this intentional?  * Larger axis of rotation when aiming crossbow and bombs. There's a small limit right now, and sometimes I can't shoot high enough to hit flying monsters. *  ~~Auto sheathing swords sometimes happens while still in combat but a little far away, or an archer is targeting and you can't parry because you didn't close yet.~~ FIXED * Option to manually turn on and off combat mode.  **Economy:**  * Merchants need a buy back feature at the price it was sold at. Maybe this should be in a different tab so that the sold items don't clog up the main screen. * The buy/sell ratio should be more equalized. Right now it is a little ridiculous for both gameplay and immersion. * There is very little coin in the beginning of the game, and lot once you hit level 12 or so.   * Food and alcohol prices are extremely high.  **HUD:**  * Adjustable minimap size * Slower and larger combat and item log * A toggle button * Smaller size possible~~ * Being able to move it to the actual edge of the screen (adjustable settings don't get it quite there)~~ FIXED * An option for a compass/clock without the minimap  **Map:**  * Zooming out more * Quest filtering/switching on map; maybe have the option show all quests in grey, and clicking on a marker makes it the active quest. * Multiple quests shown * Option to show a map of the inside area of a cave on the large map screen * Custom notes * Icons for merchants, blacksmiths, and armorers dont disappear when they unload * The world map is hard to scroll with a gamepad, the cursor sticks very aggressively to icons.  **Crafting and Alchemy:**  * Monster mutagens could be disassembled/be used for regular upgrades * *A sort function in the crafting window, perhaps by item level or damage/armor so that we don't have to look through everything to find the best one.* **A filter menu was added, a sort function would be even better.** * NEW: Ingredients and alcohol should be listed as already owned when in the inventory * Mutagen bug: Need to reapply them every load in character page to get the base bonus * Tabs in the dismantling menu * The collapsible menus should not reset. * Choosing whether or not to replenish potions and bombs when meditating; and/or choosing to refill potions without meditating. * ~~Hide feature for already crafted potions; on the same note, don't replace the old recipe with the enhanced one.~~ DONE! * Crafting should also have a item is already owned notification when confirming so you don't make something twice * When dismantling items, show how much of the components I already own and how much they are worth. How am I supposed to make a decision between dismantling and selling if I don't know if a component is rare or valuable? * Highlight new recipes * Allow us to auto-buy missing materials from the vendor if he stocks them, or double clicking on the material from the crafting screen to craft it.  Now you have to look at the material missing, look for it in between a huge list then look what do you need to craft it and search again. * Possibly remaking a piece of equipment to rise its level to your own  **Quests:**   * Have active quest appear in the quest menu when opened, and save the drop down state. * Make the flavor text of quests and glossary entries more friendly when they update. * Easy searching of completed quests.  **Inventory:**  * New tab for Books, Letters, and Notes * Books and scrolls should have an additional tooltip line indicating read/unread * Books and letters should have the option to be read when picked up/looted, instead of having to find it in the inventory * New tab for food or potions/oils/decoctions * Different tabs for crafting  amp; alchemy * A sort function with multiple options (weight, price, quality, level req., name, etc.). Or more minimally, don't sort them by pickup time, because this creates a lot of clutter, especially in the usable items tab. (Potions mixed in with decoctions, etc.) In addition, have mutagens autosort under the rest of the alchemy ingredients by color; right now they're mixed in with the rest in a random order. * A tab for Gwent cards in the inventory  * When buying from a merchant or looting, items should have a line in their info popup that states either "Owned: (#)" or "Unowned" * There is a lot of dead space on the screen. Either expand the grids or use it in another way? * **Maybe**: A list option instead of a grid system  **Other/Controversial/Inane:**  * Better navigation of menus (e.g. quick exit) * Option to turn subtitles off for English/chosen language but keep them for the other languages in game in order to understand them. * More higher level quests * Better leveling -- doing all the side quests leaves you way over leveled * Better trophies * Fix item weight (feline armor set should not weigh more than griffen!) * More things to do, people to talk to after the main story * Rewards that correlate to quest level. My blade of the bits was level 15 because that's when I started the quest, even though I ended it at level 19 or so. My masterwork sword was outclassed by the time I got it. * Assign a hotkey for reapplying current oil * Being able to loot under your feet. You currently have to move a little. * Option to reduce the frequency of background music playing.  * FOV slider * Fist fights should not immediately start on a cutscene ending. There isn't enough time to react. * An expanded glossary: Herb locations/descriptions, cities/factions/locations, etc. * ~~The drop rate for some alchemy substances is low for rare monsters, like a golem heart or ekkimarra hide. Can we get either the monster to appear more often, a higher drop rate, or special alchemy merchants to sell these for high prices?~~ FIXED. Still need to find my golem heart though * More gradient speeds * Cloaks and hoods would look really cool * Camera zoom in and out, if possible. * Ability to pause cutscenes. * Meditating should save the game.  **Extra Requests: (Ignore this):**  * Romance DLC * Allow Geralt to imbibe more alcohol. * Ability to give money to beggars
Weird, I'll look out for it. They do have a thread for bug reports on the cdpr forums, you should probably post it over there.
CDPR: Since you're reading this...   Awesome job guys! I've barely got to Skellige and I'm 80+ hours into the game already. IMO, this should go into the list as one of the best games of all time.   However, there are a bunch of things that people have found to be annoying about the gameplay, which, if fixed, would make the game even more enjoyable. Since you guys don't have the time to be reading every post, a lot of these probably slipped past you. So I took the time to compile all of the complaints/proposed fixes I saw and made them into a list. Here they are!  **Important:**  * Fix fall damage! Make it less, automatic roll, etc. Maybe a potion. We should be able to jump from heights like in the Witcher 1 intro video. * More key bindings, fix some of the ones available.

We really appreciate all your hard work!   Non CDPR people: Add your own in the comments. Maybe CDPR will hear you too. ;)  Edit: Edited  Edit 2: Since I'm not going to bother responding to every person, I have a few points:  1. These are suggestions I have seen people have that I thought made sense or seen other people agree with. Yes, some are frivolous, but I purposely did put not graphics or bugs/glitches here. Would you prefer this or a bunch of people continuing to make the same complaints over and over? This is deliberately a positive list of things to make the game better; if you have an objection to something on the list, say it! Writing that 80% of this is crap helps no one and only makes the entire discussion acrimonious.  2. Yes, these are minor improvements, only because the Witcher 3 is already such a great game. No, CDPR is not obligated to do anything. However, since they said they are reading this forum, why not bring issues to their attention? Lot's of good suggestions are buried.   3. Sheesh people, stop freaking out about the list idea. It was a suggestion I saw a couple of times that I saw other people agree to. Thanks for making your objections known, CDPR probably won't do it.   4. For the people who made more suggestions, thanks! I added some of them in.
I made a mod list!   I was searching for mods and getting really annoyed but Nexus' UI. Since NMM doesn't work yet for the Witcher 3 (I think), I couldn't keep track of which mods I downloaded, if they updated, etc. It was also hard to compare several mods of the same type.  [So, I made a list!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zStz8eChga1xHsntz2qKyBgK_BCy9_S-Pvnx4DfKRYk/edit#gid=0)   Right now it's minimal -- I only included the link, name and author. In the first tab, I also broke them up into different categories to make them easier to sort. Maybe later the community can do something like Skyrim Gems, though I don't think the modding community will get quite that big since the Witcher is a more focused game.  If you want to help edit, shoot me a PM and I'll add you.  Enjoy!  Edit: If you're looking, upvote this so other people can see it too!
Paid mods are coming, whether we like it or not. We must be ready for them.   [Link to original /r/skyrimmods post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/343ym0/paid_mods_are_coming_whether_we_like_it_or_not/) ods and other "industry practices" to allow this. I'm new to the modding community, which means I only started playing Morrowind a year ago and Skyrim over the last six months. But like people have been saying a lot, recent events have inspired me to give back. As I have next to no money and not enough time to learn to mod extensively (even though I played around with it a bit in Morrowind), I was thinking about what's going to happen in the future. I realized two things:  1. Paid mods are coming, no matter how much we protest. The Valve press release was pretty clear about that.  2. Next time around, there won't be a community uproar at nearly the same scale. The Skyrim modding community is the biggest we have, another one won't be established by the time the next game is released. We can't stop the hundreds of thousands from buying the next Bethseda game, even if it is announced with paid mods.   Since we can't stop paid mods arriving, I think the best solution is to preemptively speak as a community to Valve and Bethesda about what we *do* want. Reading around the forums, I've noticed most people don't have a problem with paid mods **in theory**, as long as several key conditions are met. However, the implementation this time around was abysmal and we all realized nothing but slow (or not so slow) decline of mods would come from it.   So I have a radical idea. I think we should compile a list of the many sins that were committed, the problems they would cause, and improvements that would need to occur next time. We can present these to Valve/Bethesda as demands for the community to reluctantly support, or at least not condemn, paid mods. By conditioning our support on several key demands, we can make sure Valve sets up a marketplace that does not set off the disastrous effects we fear. Both parties would benefit: Since we can't stop paid mods, we could turn them into something which will have neutral or maybe even beneficial effects. Bethesda won't get the inevitable PR hit next time around, which is fresh in their minds right now and so holds the most power.  I've started small list below, and I think it would be great for the community to put together a comprehensive list and make it as official as possible. Hopefully this will be an opportunity to bring us together after the recent bitterness.  Here's my start, from what I've seen people saying.   Issues:  1. The way the marketplace was set up encouraged crap shovelware micro transactions over good mods. 2. There is no good way to test a mod and return it if it doesn't work. 3. There is no way to make sure that the modder will continue supporting the mod through main game updates and other mod changes.  4. Mods use one another assets all the time, which makes monetizing them a legal quagmire. In addtion, relying on modders and the community to police stolen assets in unworkable. 5. The paltry 25% the modders got was absolutely ridiculous. 6. The secrecy of the implementation runs counter to how the modding community functions. 7. Most of us using mods don't use the Workshop because of its limited functionality, meaning we can't access the mods posted like SkyUI 5.0.  (To see longer arguments for above points, go to [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/343jtf/your_voices_were_heard/cqr1041) by /u/xaliber_skyrim   Solutions:   **Quality**  /u/DiamondMind: A paid mod being on the marketplace means that the developer has endorsed it as unofficial DLC for the game and guarantee it. This legitimizes the cut they take and gives them a stake to supervise which mods have their name attached.   /u/DavidJCobb: All mods must have a seven day return policy, no questions asked and no consequences.  /u/BullZEye22: Mods should gather a certain amount of approval before they can be sold.  /u/fadingsignal: Behind the scenes, there should be a partially dedicated faster-response support team for mod authors. If a mod is having trouble because the Steam downloader is screwing it up, or there is abuse or stolen assets being used, someone who is a verified author should have a slightly elevated support level, so they can in turn better support their customers who purchase their mods.  **User convenience**  /u/DavidJCobb: Load order managers and mod managers are essential to using mods while keeping one's game stable, but Skyrim doesn't natively support these tools, and the average Steam user won't know much about them. This is quite possibly the largest barrier to modding. Bethesda must develop their own analogues to LOOT and MO/NMM, and integrate these directly into the PC versions of FO4 and TES6.  Authors should be permitted to upload full archives, rather than a BSA/ESP pairing (the current limitation), but the uploading of loose files should be discouraged, and some sort of warning should be indicated to the user in the Steam Workshop's UI.  /u/DiamondMind: Do not tie downloads into the workshop; allow them to be used like Nexus files. That way, Bethesda and other developers do not need to create their own tool and force us all to use it.   /u/fadingsignal: Fix the Steam Downloader to be actually useful.  **Compensation**  For Paid Mods:  Modders need to get at least 50% of the sale. Valve and the publisher can work out how to split the other 50% on their own. There are more than enough differences between mods and other "industry practices" to allow this.  /u/fadingsignal: Option to set the minimum price to $0   For Unpaid Mods:  /u/NeuroticNyx: A donation button for unpaid mods on the Steam Workshop. No profit form Bethesda can be made from this, as it is not endorsed.  /u/MaryMudpie: A system of Pay-What-You-Want for all mods. (Probably not going to happen.)  /u/EggheadDash: A pop for a donation once the game is closed, with Yes/Remind me Later/No options.  **Compatibility patches**  Modders should be permitted to create compatibility patches between mods even when one of the mods is paid, so long as the compatibility patches don't use any resources from any of the original mods (including the paid one(s)) without their authors' permissions. Users should not be permitted to sell compatibility patches; they should remain free. This should rather neatly solve the community's concerns about the interoperability of paid mods; if a paid mod is good enough, I guarantee you that some industrious user will build a patch to make it work.   **Limitations on sale**  /u/DavidJCobb Mod authors should not be permitted to sell bugfixes for base game content, official DLC, or any other mods. These must be free. Obviously this policy must be worded in such a manner as to permit a mod author to continue selling a mod even if they must later release a bugfix for it; yet to forbid that author from releasing the bugfix itself as a separate paid product.  /u/DiamondMind: UI and other "fixes," not just bugs, should also never be sold.  Perhaps there should also be a lower limit on the content sold so that microtransactions like adding a sword aren't allowed.  **Theft**  If a mod author's resources are stolen and used in a paid mod, that author should be able to report that to Valve and have it acted on promptly. The thief's revenue should be transferred to the original author; or, if the author doesn't have payment details registered with Steam, the full amount should be held in escrow indefinitely, without a time limit, until it can be transferred to the original author.  In particular, we need assurances that Valve will pay attention to content that was originally uploaded to other sites, or at least to the more notable ones, when investigating theft reports. The full details of their policies regarding theft should be made public.  **Transparency**  Speak to us every step of the way, and release a prototype version first that we can check for issues.   This is of course unfinished, and there a lot more problems to address. Comment and I'll add it to the list!
That's an understandable concern. Good on you for discussing it calmly, and rationally.  That's why I didn't post about this over the last few days. Now that everyone's emotions have calmed down somewhat, we can get something positive done.  My concerns are the inverse image of yours: if we decide that something along the lines of SkyUI shouldn't be permitted for sale, whatever logic we use to justify that can inevitably be used for just about any other game mechanic. If the community thinks that TES6's combat design is horribly lacking, will it suddenly push to deprive combat modders of their right to sell? Would that be fair to those modders?  Yes, there would need to be some clear definitions of what is allowed and prohibited. But I would rather err on the sign of overly restrictive than loose because otherwise it can get out of hand. If I had my way, I would want to restrict paid mods to ones like falskaar only (large DLC/expansion style mods), but I don't think that is going to happen for a variety of reasons.
I don't think he was. He had only one hand on it (standard protocol in case someone tries to grab it) and his hand wasn't on the trigger. Maybe he should have pointed down? Yeah, maybe. But it's such a weird thing to get upset over...
You're missing the fact that Palestinians in the West Bank in Gaza aren't robots controlled by outside forces, nor are they slaves to their baser natures. In addition, the rise of Hamas is much, much more complicated than that. in short, they were not forced into anything but rebelled against the PLO when Arafat "renounced" violence at the Oslo Accords. Even now, if there were non-violent protests in the West Bank, as well as other demonstrations that show the Palestinian people are ready for peace, the Israeli electorate would vote in a left wing government to negotiate it.
This is because Judaism/Jews predate the modern separation between religion and ethnicity. The best way to think about Judaism is that it is a set of laws for a tribe, the Jewish people. The tribe got dispersed and carried their rules with them. You are part of the tribe if you were born into it by its rules, or you gain nationality by becoming a citizen - in modern times, convert.  Does that make sense?   Now for your other points:      They still are Jewish. Someone can be Jewish, no practicing, or even having rejected the religion and their family lineage is not traced back to eastern Europe, or it's a weak connection which normally wouldn't be used to identify race. It doesn't make sense.   First, Jews trace lineage back to the expulsion from Israel, not to eastern Europe. Only a subset of Jews, Ashkenazim, are from Eastern Europe.  Second, the connection isn't so much used to identify race as your national/tribal affiliation. Think of it like this: Once you gain American citizenship, all your children are American citizens no matter where they are born. All their children, your grandchildren, are American even if they never enter America. Now just have the extra step that it must be your mother, not any American, and you've got a rough equivalency.  I just don't get how if I marry a jewish girl who's father is a north African Jew, mother is christian Caucasian. We get married and ignore all religion. Our kids would be Jewish?  See the nationality explanation above. The only difference is that for your kids to be American you have to register their birth an the embassy, but for Judaism is automatic. (Minor point: She would not be Jewish by traditional Jewish laws, so many Jews would not think she was Jewish and therefore her children would not be either.)  What is your thoughts on people saying something negative towards Israel as, 'Those Israeli...?'  It's as good (bad) as any other prejudice is. The problem is that many people say this to cover up anti-Semitism, and you only have to prod an inch for it to come out. It makes Jews assume that its not said with good intentions.
It has no significance because it is the central claim that is being disputed.   Others : Jesus is not God!  You: But what about healing others, mastering nature, forgiving sins and raising from the dead? [This shows he is God!]  Others: Many other prophets healed others, mastered nature, said God forgave sins and raised from the dead. These do not make Jesus unique.   You: But Jesus forgave sins of people directly, showing he is God!  Others: That is the claim that the NT is making, and is tautological. For Jesus to forgive sins, he must be God. The only proof we have of this, even through the NT itself, is Jesus saying so. Claiming to forgive sins does not make Jesus unique.  Make sense?  He also is reported to have said others after will do these and much greater things (JN 14:12) so not being unique isn't the significant qualifier.  Ok, then why did you say that these acts are ignored? And even so, we're talking about people **before,** not after.
Funny thing, it actually is a Jewish fast day today. It is one of six on the Jewish calendar, including yom Kippur. You clicked on a shitpost and learned something new today! Comment if you want to know more. :)
First gaming pc for a budget of $650. What do you think?   This is my build. This forum has helped me a lot over the past few weeks, so I'm going to ask one last time before I commit. I am NOT overclocking right now, but I'm leaving it open as option for the future. The parts are all bought, and currently unopened and returnable. Can I change anything to make it better?

Did I do anything majorly wrong? Anything I should change? I did want to get it around $600, I tried to get the best possible deals, and I'm satisfied with this build and its price. Thanks for all your help!
Haven't heard of it before now, and i'm a FE fan. thanks!
I haven't had any pride for years!  I'm new at this, and I'm going for a relatively cheap build. What are the advantages of getting a new case?
I do not, personally, try to live my life in order to "fit in" with Christian society.  He didn't say that, just that it was originally founded to fit in more with Christian society, which is pretty much indisputable. Reform has changed quite a lot in the past 150 years.  In addition, you are kind of are admitting it. You are just using "modern" instead of Christian, but it has the same connotation: the mitzvot, as enumerated by the rabbis, are not something you want to totally incorporate into your life. That's fine, but it is not the same thing as Judaism was before.
A 50 year ceasefire does not mean "Openly at war" still. You sound like one of the idiots that thinks North Korea and America are suddenly just going to start shooting each other at the drop of a hat.  Do you not follow the news? That border, though quiet, has been seen a number of attacks since the last ceasefire. Israel can and will bomb Syria at the drop of a hat if it feels threatened, like transfers of long range missiles to Hezbollah.  Israel helping ISIS and other rebel groups though this conflict by bombing SAA bases has just further destabilized this conflict,   Israel has only bombed in two situations: In the case of a threat like above, or if any fire lands on Israel's side of the border. If they were bombing bases like America, you would hear about it.
No, it is clear it is not about the dead, because then "for the dead" would be written at the end of the verse, not in the middle.   And if we consider the origin of this command, it serves as a way to distinguish ourselves from Canaanites.  The whole point is that Orthodoxy's view of the laws are they are in effect forever, no matter what the origin is.  Where is it written that a new may not eat a cheeseburger?  "Do not cook a kid in its mother's milk" is interpreted as "do not cook meat and milk together."
SPECIAL SMASH IS BAAAACK!!
Jesus was, after all, an unlearned Jew  Wait, I thought it was claimed he was a rabbi?  I don't find the argument that they're pulling things out of context to pull the wool over those unfamiliar with the prophecies convincing.  I wouldn't find it convincing either, except for the preponderance of evidence. I don't see any other way there are so many seemingly deliberate mistakes.  looking at the context of those verses and finding it ambiguous whether or not it is referring to the messiah.   Do you want to discuss one or more you find particularly strong or noteworthy? It's why I made the rebuttal in the first place.
I understand you're getting swamped. :P I don't have much to offer you that other people here can't top. But if you want eternal friendship, all the internet hugs, or just someone to chat with, I'm your guy. :) I'll also smash with you whenever you want! I've been playing smash since the N64 days, and though I was never I super competitive player I always loved playing, whether I got my ass kicked or not.   A PM with a code would be eternally appreciated, but if not, you have a blast playing it early!
yet the reality we found out after the fact was that is worked less tahn 10% of the time.  And Israelis', who were the ones who were supposedly protected by it, knew during the conflict that it wasn't working. Just like they know now the Iron Dome is working.  you gotta open your mind and ears.  Fine, point me to the best. Your argument currently comes down to "wake up sheeple!"
That was the argument as to why not develop it in the first place. But the vast majority of the cost was paid in development and now it is working extremely well and people feel much safer, so no. It is actually a kind of celebrity.
From a previous point of mine about why Isaiah 53 is clearly about Israel:  Isaiah 53 is very clearly talking about the Children of Israel, though it is obscured by the way Christians separated the chapters. If you look at 52: 13-15 (which is the same section that starts with chapter 50), you can see that the prophet introduces a "servant" in third person. 13 says that the servant will be exalted, 14 that (in past tense) "marred beyond man is his appearance," 15 that (in future tense) how kings and nations will react.  Then, in 53:1, the narrative shifts to the perspective of those kings and nations, who are talking about the servant after he has risen and exalted. In the past, "he had not form," "he was despised," etc. But now "He has grown," "he might see offspring," etc. Then in the second half of verse 11 the narrative shift back to prophet, who describes the servant a bit more.  Now how is it possible that, during the time the prophet was speaking, Jesus was already marred, and that nations were appalled (did this ever happen?). Only in the future will the nations say "As one who hid his face from us, he was despised, we held him to no account." Did they ever say this about Jesus? On the other hand, (the house of) Israel fulfills all of this! In context with chapters 52 and 54, if one is a believer, one could see the prophecy be fulfilled today. If you read the entire section, chapter 53 is actually the pivot between a mourning Israel/Jerusalem and a joyous one, it makes sense why Israel would be referred as a "suffering servant" here.
Alright, I see  , but no assur. I also see no discussion on what a single person can or should do. I also see that a Katan does suffice for the tenth, unlike kedusah, meaning this is on a lower level. (Actually, I think I might have misinterpreted this--it's unclear whether these are laws for just kaddish or also brachu, kedusha, etc.) From my limited knowledge is seems totally fine to say the words of the kaddish by yourself, but it does not yotzei you.  Maybe the Aruch Hashulchan discusses it, but I can't look right now.
Oh, not a full takeover, but a limited one just near the border. The "I keep bombing you as long as you shoot rockets" and "I will keep the blockade until you get rid of the rockets" are pretty strong cards in my opinion.
Nope.  [It can be concluded that the use of human shields requires an intentional co-location of military objectives and civilians or persons hors de combat with the specific intent of trying to prevent the targeting of those military objectives.](http://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v1_cha_chapter32_rule97)
Wow, great rebuttal. I'm impressed.
Yet they didnt do it last time they had chance, nor ever before.  When was this time? They've only attacked sporadically from tunnels after it was clear that the IDF is going to destroy them so Hamas won't be able to use them in the future.   The tunnels were stupidly not taken as a big danger by the government until now. If one attack happened from a tunnel and casualties resulted, Israel would immediately invade Gaza and destroy them. They could only be used once/in one military operation.  They dont need 10 people kidnapped, they can get the equal attention by a single guy or a couple.  No, they need as much people killed and kidnapped as possible, for popularity, money, and exchanges.
Unfortunately, there will be no journalists in the area because it's an active military zone and ground fighting. No confirmation from other completely unbiased sources will have to wait.
