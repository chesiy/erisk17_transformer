I can only answer this question as a handsome, well-mannered moose-riding Mountie Canadian.  The 4th of July is the day 'Murica had a huge tea party in Boston right after Christopher Columbus docked, bringing nice blankets for all the aboriginal people. His boat accidentally hit something, sending oil barrels ablaze, which is how they invented fireworks. Then, a bunch of dudes in red coats came in with spiky guns to try and help clean up the mess, but were attacked by bald eagles, led by Abraham Lincoln and John Handcock. Eventually, they wrote a few story ideas on a napkin, but Handcock sneezed in it, so they glued on a few extra napkin amendments to fix the paragraphs that got smudged by his nose-sludge. And THAT, my friend, is 'MURICA DAY.
It's always good to know a curse word or two in every language, though I find throwing my fists in the air, stomping my feet, and screaming "RAWWRR!!" to be pretty universal.
I am *always* terrified to post my stories because I don't know whether they'll be a huge flop, or successful  but I can't say it's because I doubt my work. There are so many factors behind why a story -even a good one- can fail on NoSleep, that I just put my heart into it and hope it gets traction.  That said, I do have a file folder of scrapped ideas and half-written stories. I think that's normal. You can't always spew out pure writing gold.  If I can be so bold as to offer a bit of advice  maybe you should try printing your story out and revising it on-paper? I personally find that my brain works a lot better that way, and I can catch where the story loses its flow with a lot more ease.  Aside from that, all I can tell you is: post. Post as much as you want. What's the worst that can happen? Your story won't gain traction. That's OK, you can try again with the next one.
I hope to feature a reading of this story on my YouTube channel :D  Ooooh, that'd be awesome. :)
Why waste time on old stories when you've got a slew of new skills and experiences at your disposal and you could just create something new?  For the same reason we renovate homes instead of building new ones: it creates jobs which, in turn, helps the economy grow. DO YOU HATE THE ECONOMY, KNEEOD?!  No, no wait. That definitely doesn't make sense. Let me try again.  Because  it keeps away the termites? Yeah. That's the reason. Termites. Let's keep them away.  (I can see the benefit of wanting to rework a story. Sometimes, you love the idea, but hate how it was applied, and want another kick at the can. I'd be inclined to go back and fix some of my stories if/when I release an anthology. 'Cause the formatting on some of my earlier ones makes my eyes bleed. And some of them weren't up to par. And termites. TERMITES EVERYWHERE.)
I think you're cool! :D
Hey, don't put yourself down like that. You're a couple of reasonably-sized birds in a human suit.
I had a ton of weird stuff happen to me in a house I used to live in. I once GENUINELY believed a burglar broke in, only to investigate and find the house empty. The place was creepy from the get-go, what with the previous tenants having left overnight without telling anyone, and the poems of suicide written in crayon in what ended up being my room. I mean, this sounds like some kind of horror movie BS, but I'm being dead serious. I'd see figures sometimes, too. And I don't mean small apparitions caught in the corner of my vision. I mean full-blown figures, while I was 100% concious, and that I could follow into other rooms before they disappeared.   It wasn't even that old of a house. Maybe 35-45 years old when we rented it.   My theory was either a brain tumor, or some kind of electromagnetic field seriously messing with my head, 'cause my parents and sister never saw anything. My friends; however, said they could 'feel' things---even before I ever mentioned weird stuff going down.
Well, fiddlesticks and fudgesicles!
Thank you! :)
Craig's a trustworthy fellow connected to a real website. He contacted me back in December for the same reason. Not sure why your emails aren't getting through: I had no trouble communicating with him back then. If/when you manage to get through, he'll send you a consent form to fill out.  I know they have a huge backlog of stories to adapt, so once that step is done, it might take a while before you see anything on their website. Either way, I assure you they're perfectly legitimate.  Just like /u/notsohornyowl said, they sometimes team up with The NoSleep podcast.
HECK YEAH!
Someone told me they were a fan. That totally made my day. But I have to say, pretty much any comment I receive makes me really happy.
First offouch.  Doesn't matter how it happened, though. I'm making you my honorary brother. We people-with-crooked-fingers have to stick together!
...xD
Sadly, I have no idea what this is. When ya'll posted about it a few weeks ago, I tried to find the original post explaining it, but failed. Then food distracted me.
