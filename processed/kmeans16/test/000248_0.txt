My superhero universe is heavily influenced by DC comics and Marvel as well as Hellblazer for the supernatural side. I've got metahumans, mutants, aliens and magic users in every corner of the universe, and that's not counting the Powers of Olympus and Asgard. The superheroes of the universe are similar to the ones on the show Powers, being celebrities and public figures. Sidekicks are seen as a formality, and villains and heroes are seemingly obliged to have young people as either proxies or companions in adventures. I also have a 'Savage Land' expy known as 'The Island', a place where super strong and animal powered villains are housed.  My fantasy world is similar to Discworld, with the ridiculous magic system and crazy characters. The theme of 'the hero has the flu, the janitor or intern's gotta save the world' is a major theme. I've also sprinkled in a dash of Lemoney Snicket's narration and trademark dark humor.   My Science Fiction universe is similar to Korra era Avatar, with a class of humans and Vetari (blue skinned humanoid aliens) with elemental powers.  The technology and style is inspired by Borderlands, with a rustic yet futuristic flare, as is the megacorperations rule over various systems. The protagonist's ability was inspired by DC comic's hero Firestorm.
New webseries idea- Urban Fantasy   Hey Redditors,  I'm thinking about working on an urban fantasy series this summer, to get some ideas off my chest. The plot is about a college Freshman who discovers that he can see the supernatural around him. He's like a 'muggle best friend' of a werewolf and ghost, who go out and battle monsters in human form. It's still in the rough stages, but this is where y'all come in. You guys can throw out ideas and suggestions for the series.   Edit- Sorry, I was going through my notes and the protagonist is going to become the next Grim Reaper, sorry I missed that.
(Prompt) Would anyone mind helping develop superpowers, ideas for types of monster slayers and monsters for my fantasy world?   Hey Redditors,   I've begun working on a story set in a fantasy world where magic and magical creatures have been (explosively) introduced in a wave of altering particles. Some people begin to develop magic abilities in a manner similar to superpowers in the wake of this explosion and the influx of creatures means that monster slaying has become a profession. (edit) Before the explosion, there were some people with the ability to transform into an animal at will. This ability isn't magical in nature, and no one really knows how people can do this. The shape shifters (known as 'Wulders' by normal people) are now in direct competion as heroes and adventurers as Powered people begin to rise.
So you'd be a double robot?
Shapeshifters in the 14th century.   Hey Redditors! Just started writing a new story set in a new setting. It's set in a alternative version of 14 century Europe, where America is being colonized. Some people are born with a gift- the ability to become one animal at will. However, they keep their ability hidden due to the Inquisition happening at the time. Dinosaurs are also alive in this universe, and are used as beasts of burden and pets, (yes, T-Rexes can be sweet pookies too). That's all I have for now, please feel free to ask questions!
Thanks!
Characters in a book I'm writing   Hey Redditors,  I've been working on a book for the better part of a year now, and i wanted to show off the main characters and get some feedback regarding them. The basic plot is that death has stopped working and the five protagonists have to find out why before the world ends.  I've started to work on a few adventuring interns as the protagonists, I'd like to see what you guys would think about them.  Carter, a mage who is terrible with magic. While he can use basic fire and polymorph spells, he can't do much else and is useless in a physical fight.  Nate is a borderline sociopathic kleptomaniac rouge. It is heavily implied that his childhood was not normal, and through out the book, his nonchalant reactions towards death, assassins and arson reveal that he was raised by an assassin. Nate is also hypersexual, not having any qualms against sleeping with anyone or anything. In combat he uses a crossbow and throwing knives that he isn't very good at throwing. He sucks at hand to hand and relies on trickery and dirty tactics to win.  Daniel- I know he's a young swordsman, but I need help for him in terms of personailty and quirks  Kara is a young woman who is raised by dwarves. As a result, she is capable of defending herself in hand to hand combat and is the only party member who is able to hold off multiple opponents single handily. However, while she is a badass, Kara isn't very good in social situations and due to the dwarven tradition of judo throwing people as a way of saying 'hello', this leads to some really awkward situations.  Felix is the grim reaper's teenaged and amnesiac apprentice. He is the voice of reason in the cast and tries his best to guide the them in the right direction. As the apprentice of Death, he is capable of teleporting and entering the realm of the dead. Despite the fact that he wears a skull mask, he's a nice guy.
Interesting! Very Tarzanish!
Pantaria has a lot of weird creatures, but the most popular are Dungeon Dogs. They resemble Yorkies, but can assume the form of any inanimate object. They tend to favor the forms of treasure chests,giant keys and statues, ensnaring and devouring adventurers who find try and take them.  Like Discworld's Luggage, the species has a stomach that apparently has no end, allowing the creature to swallow creatures and objects of any size. Magizoologists have confirmed that it's 'Really cool' and after sending an intern in, they confirmed that 'it's probably dangerous.'    However, they can be tamed and several generations have been bred to be adorable house pets in various colors like orange, blue, red and pink. They tend to bond with one person in particular and will fiercely defend them to the death. They also do well with children as their morphable bodies allow Dungeon Dogs to withstand rigorous play.   The species also enjoys adventuring with their masters, accompanying them into dungeons or even other dimensions. When at home, they tend to take the form of common house hold objects or sometimes other species of animals, albeit with the Dungeon Dog's true coloring.
Hey Zoey, I understand how rough things are. My parents and I, all the way across the world in Texas are praying for you! And rember, you're not alone. You have the Yognauts behind you!
Happy birthday Simon!
Yogscast Megaman bosses   Hey Yognauts! If the Yogscast were to be in a Mega-Man styled game, what would each of their stages, enemies and boss abilities be?
Dang dude, nice! I love how Hatfilms are just three harpies. I have an image of them sitting on a rock and throwing shit at sailors. I wish someone would draw a picture of the 'Demi-Yogs' on a ship like the Argonauts.
No, just for fun! :)
"You want hope?!" I shouted up at the gods on their seats of power. Zeus, on his platinum throne, scowled at me, but a gentle nudging from Odin beside him made him sit up straighter. The one eyed god, resembling Brian Blessed, gave me a fatherly smile and nodded encouragingly.  "I don't see what gives you, as gods, the right to destroy humanity! You, of all the beings in reality, should not exist! You have toyed with humans, manipulated them and slept with them. Civilizations have risen and fallen due to you lot, and you know what I say to that?" I shouted, turning in a full circle at the pantheon surrounding me, like an arena. I caught the glimpses of gods from the story books my mom read to me as a kid.  The Jackal headed Anubis was gnawing on a grotty bone and casting glances at gods around him and growling. The amazingly hot Aphrodite was curling her hair into little ringlets. She paused to look down at me and blow a kiss in my direction. Thor was putting Hemsworth to shame, his Viking armor straining to contain his muscles. Loki was looking down at me, his thin face scared with snake venom and age. His immortality wasn't doing him any favors. His sad eyes, webbed with cataracts, told me everything, just like what the Oracle had said. The eyes would decide everything. "I think before you point fingers at humanity, you look at yourselves!" I shouted. Zeus's face twisted into a snarl.  "Foolish boy! You dare compare us to your kind?!" He rose up from his throne, the air smelling of ozone.  "I should fry you where you stand!" He howled. I felt like bolting, but stood my ground.  "Go ahead sparky. Because to me, your not the god of lighting. Your just an angry guy with superpowers." Zeus howled and pointed a finger at me firing a bolt of lighting. The gods in the audience screamed in horror, but I closed by eyes and focused on the bolt. I heard a sizzle and opened my eyes. A circle of ash surrounded me, but I was unharmed.  "By Cronos...." Zeus gasped, a look of pure shock on his face.  I smirked. "You see, gods and humans are symbiotic in nature. I don't believe that Zeus's power over lighting is real. So it isn't. Well, it was, but I believed that it didn't effect me." I adjusted my Roman toga and tried to ignore my shaking knees. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Athena wink at me knowingly. That gave me the courage to finish. "So, considering that I just kicked Zeus in the butt and lived to tell about it. And I just confirmed that you need my kind to stay on this side of reality. So, who votes for keeping humanity around?" ------------- "You performed well Chris Topher." Athena said, placing a hand on my shoulder. I was back outside my English class, at my university. I was back in my old clothes and I've never been happier to be wearing sweatpants and a 'Yogscast' t-shirt. Time was still stopped as before, everything frozen in place.  I turned to face the goddess, who was wearing her ceremonial armor. Her long dirty blonde hair cascaded down her back and shoulders like a caramel waterfall. Her face was beautiful in a strangely down to earth way, like underneath the armor and power, she was a normal woman.   "Thank you my-" I began, but Athena shook her head and smiled. "No brave one, I come to thank YOU. You restored hope that humanity is worth saving. You showed us that humans are stronger than even the king of the gods. And I have this-" A leather corded necklace appeared in her hand. In the center was a small silver bead in the shape of an owl. "For my new champion." I took it and held it in my hand. "My lady- I mean Athena, are you-" She put her fingers to my lips and 'shushed' me.  "Be silent, my brave one." Before time started up again, she thrust something into my hand before vanishing. I opened my fist to find a slip of paper, on witch was written, 'Project Argonauts 2'  --------------------- Hermes grinned when he saw Athena return.  "Well, how did it go?" he asked, with the excitement of a school boy at Christmas. "It went well." Athena said, ignoring the messenger god. But Hermes wasn't there. He was already running off on his way around Olympus like a flash. Athena entered her private quarters and gazed at herself in the mirror. Then she paused. She swore she saw something out of the corner of her eye- Something hard slammed into the back of her head, throwing her face first into the marble mirror stand. Through the haze of pain and blood clouding her face, she saw a man with cloudy, milky eyes and scars across his face, standing over her with a bloodstained vase.  "Excuse me sweetheart, I'm going to need your identity for a while, alright?" he said, as his face and clothes morphed into an exact copy of hers.  "Well, look that that, I've got my own duds!" he crowed, before shattering the vase against the floor and picking up and shard. The Fake Athena grabbed Athena's hair and pulled back sharply, exposing her neck.   "Now, let's get rid of some evidence!"
