I call it cultural tourism. They enjoy hardcore music but can't imagine the source of some of the pain and anger that produces these songs they can merely induldge in recreationally.   GFK and the rest of the Wu are some of the most certified guys in the history of musical entertainment...we're talking FBI files and all of that.   And for AB to even think the SLIGHTEST degree of disrespect would go un-noticed lets us know that we've gotten to a point where people think they can disrespect LEGENDS in the game
I have a masters degree and about to start school for a professional degree.  This is reddit...not my work office.  So yea, i'll talk to you anyway I please while you type away in your freshman dorm.  This culture is bigger than what some disrespectful out of touch home-body has to think  Go bump that Iggy and share it with Fantano

I believe it's similar to the situation in Russia. Putin too intelligent and worldly to be as personally religious and homophobic as his policies and statements reflect, but the Russian people are something like 80% orthodox and not too fond of the gays, and he's ultimately culpable to their opinions.    if you saw the last season of House of Cards, the russian leader kinda reminds me of what you're implying.
Amazing
LOL. Hell no.  For all we know, they probably reached out
At what point is the white community going to address systemic white supremacy actively planning and targeting minority communities?   It never ends.  We have racist cops participating in Klan meetings, we have racist cops shooting at paper targets of black youth for practice, we have websites dedicated to white supremacy and subreddits that condone violence and economic oppression against people of color, and we have a media that refuses to even use the word "terrorism" or use unbiased reporting when it comes to issues addressing overt acts of vengeance against people of color  As a person of color...its tiring to have to defend yourself against all of these barrages on your character, your community and your desire to just be treated as normal.   We've fought for every war. We've participated in every level of government. We've clawed for respect and justice.  So when will the white community speak out about whats going on in their community?
Snowden did not take any files with him to Russia. As a teacher of Chinese counterintelligence, he knows how to keep his data safe. Neither the Chinese nor the Russians stole his data, nor did they "break the encryption", this entire story is utter nonsense and transparently so to anybody with a modicum of crypto experience.  Thats a nice cover-up to avoid the fact that they really had no tight clamp on the data that they claimed to   So Greenwald says "my files are safe"...and it turns out they're not.  So where does this leave us?
I don't agree because you're not offering any immediate practical solutions instead of holding out for ambiguous, non-specific pie in the sky bullshit.   This sounds like a great fiction story...but this doesn't help us RIGHT NOW.  So no, keep that "border-less world" crap to yourself. Its not even relevant...and its insulting you could be that naive to even try to use that as a talking point.
I DO understand it.  But i'm asking if its really and truly a good idea.  Theres a lot of people in the US who I absolutely think don't either appreciate what it takes to run a nation like the US or has the balls to be assertive enough to lean on other nations in large geopolitical matters.  I partly worry that the average person is either uneducated or simply...too nice and thus, naive.
Good point. We need more density IN ADDITION to commuter lines.   Turning ATL into Boston/DC-light isn't a bad thing  We don't need a damn train to lovejoy. We need lines to west midtown, to EAV, to VAHI, collier, etc.   We do. The Original plan was to go to Griffin
This is precisely what the problem was with Charles C Johnson.  I have no problem with having contemptible people on the show. none.  HOWEVER..Joe needs to do a better job of pushing back if he's going to have outright bad people on his show. If he doesn't, then he stands out as someone who looks like they're condoning it.
It DID however put one suspect on probation for trying to go to a terrorist training camp 5 years ago.  You can't arrest someone with pre-crime e.g. "you're going to jail because we think you'll try and kill infidels 5 years from now"

You know whats funny? Obama could NEVER be as remotely corrupt in his personal life as any one who ever challenged him politically during an election   We can argue that he has had some questionable policies and decisions, but his personal life is pretty much as clean as you can ever ask a politician's to be.  I mean, if Obama had ever done so much as taken an extra candy bar, he'd be on the front page and barred from running for POTUS.   Its just weird seeing the Clintons back in the ring knowing how much dirt they have on themselves.
