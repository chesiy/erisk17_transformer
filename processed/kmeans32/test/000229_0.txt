Frag, your sarcasm is quite hilarious, but you're missing my point, and inventing another. I didn't say anything about the game needing to be "happy fun time." I understand that there will be bandits. It's the fact that the zombies are completely unimportant to these guys. In a real *zombie* apocalypse, yes, there would be bandits, and people battling each other, but they'd have to account for the zombies. How is this not obvious?
After watching every season of gossip girl it makes me think that if we were born with a trust fund we would have grown up differently, and choose different paths then we are on now.  That said, someone said something about college. I can hardly afford it now. I would never have to worry about tuition again, and i would just learn. Then use that knowledge for society.   At least that's what i say. I don't know what i would do of i *actually* had money.
Of course man! I'm going through some tough things with a girl myself and it makes me feel great to know I'm not alone. We all suffer in some way or another, but if we stick together we can get through these things. I'm growing used to relationships being the way they are, but I look at the many people who have great, lasting marriages rather than those who are single or are divorced.  The darker side may look more prominent but at least there is a bright side.
Greatest success of my life
Differential Equations help needed, finding level set and t-intervals that define y(t). I don't understand what it's asking very well.
I have a very cheap wooden desk I built. I need an idea for a table top. And ideas?   The table top is made of plywood. [This is basically what it looks like with dimensions.](http://i.imgur.com/A2MRi.jpg) The plywood is sanded enough to be smooth, but I need something smooth enough that I can write on a piece of paper on it. Any good ideas? I was thinking something like tiles, but the tiles would have to be big so the grout isn't in the way. Lighter would be nice, but not necessary. Any ideas would be great! I can take pictures of the actual desk if need be.
Thanks for the reply. She replies with "why?" every time I tell her. Though it's painful that she won't say it back (I swear she was going to, she basically said she loved me in different words [I love everything about you, etc.]) it's something that she needs to hear, and it's the truth. I feel it, and if it takes the rest of my life to show her she is loved, it'll be a life well spent to me. I think OP, though it may be hard, needs to look at the other side and see that if someone is in love with you, truly nothing can get in the way of that.
I'm the one saying "I love you," and i don't plan on stopping. Call me foolish... That's what love is I guess
Sounds more like you just have a poor sense of humor, which is quite the tragedy. If I'm easily amused that's fine, I'd rather that than the opposite.
Rest in peace in peace? Did I miss a joke?
Not a hacker report, but I'm curious if this is what happened.   While in a populated (16 or so) room, one of my buddies got shot from the tree lines, while my other friend and I were looting a small room. We closed the doors and sat and waited, planning our escape. We do not usually kill. My buddy is a hero and I'm making my way up there.   We didn't want to engage, we just wanted to flee. Before we open the back door to leave, we hear, "Hello? Is anyone in there?" in an eerie voice. Buddy takes a knee watching the back door with a Mk.48 and I prone watching the front with an AK-74. As soon as I see him open the door I unloaded my entire mag into his head, which was perfectly lined up with my crosshairs. He runs into the room, I reload while my friend fires the Mk.48 into his chest. As he is running back out I unload on him as he says, "Okay, I'll close your door, sorry."  Friend calls out, "Hacker, back out!" So we both Alt+F4. I know you guys don't like that, but we're not losing our survivors to a hacker. Is it most likely that this guy was a hacker since he would not die with that much lead in him? I don't really know how to identify them.
The "I want the AC130 to be removed so you should downvote me" thread.   I'm not one to complain about Battlefield often, but the AC130 is a serious problem. Don't comment if your not going to be constructive.   "YOUR A STUPID FAGGOT NOOB."    or "LEARN 2 PLAY" comments are unnecessary.  The gunship is way too powerful. The splash damage is too high. It kills people inside buildings without completely obliterating the buildings. It respawns practically immediately after it is shot down. It requires at least two Stinger carriers to effectively bring it down before it annihilates your whole team, with the explosives perk. Then you need a support gunner to fill you up as soon as you're out. That takes three men out of the battle. And it can kill you when you spawn in deployment.  It needs to be either A) Nerfed to hell, B) Completely removed from the game, or C) only allowed on certain maps/game modes with a much lower spawn frequency.  Downvote me if you have to, but I want opinions.
I truly appreciate this reply. It is advice I will not take lightly. I might take you up on the offer to message you as well. Your last sentence really does hit home. I appreciate you giving me the opportunity to see into the mind of someone who is going through this, since she won't allow it.
I didn't know you could hold them all in Diamond! I have Diamond, so I might go catch 1000 pidgeys. That would be a good solution. I own at least one of every generation aside from Gen 1 where I own them all. As soon as BW2 come out, that might satiate our desire to play, but honestly none of the games compare to HG/SS in my opinion. It might just be my nostalgia playing tricks on me though.
Hah, I know how that is... I want to do that, but my friend and I usually do this really nerdy thing where we both start over at the same time and, while taking our time, we move along the routes at the same pace. Which means we can't start over at different times. I'm honestly tempted to just buy another copy at this point! haha
All of the advice is definitely helping. She has been working since 8:00 this morning though so I haven't been able to contact her. She was going to get off late Sunday and our plans were just to have me stay over at her place. We made these plans last night after she changed like this. It was only last Sunday when she was over, smiling, and we were perfectly fine. And she doesn't lie well, so I would know if she was hiding something. Is changing that fast common? And is there a possibility she'll have a mood swing back to happiness?
I laughed when I don't feel like being happy. haha, thanks korn!
Thanks man! I'm new to the game, so it's nice to know this kind of thing!
Definitely will. Thanks blue!
That was my assumption. I was also curious as to how small the layers would get as we reach similar levels to where we are now. Like for instance, we use computers to run machines that build computers. Rebuilding the computers without the machines, in order to run the machines, would be another layer we probably couldn't circumvent.
If a tree falls into a gif after being a video for 2 hours, does its repost make a sound?
So I wanted to ask someone why they featured a post on r/srs, but realized after posting it that I can only have downvotes or double downvotes instead of downvotes or upvotes respectively. Am I just sleep deprived or is that actually how the subreddit works?
You're actually quite wrong. I was a server, and my wage was $2.15 an hour, but if I didn't make at least minimum wage they *did not* make up the difference.  And if you think washing dishes or cooking food is more difficult than being a server you are dead wrong. Serving is one of the hardest jobs. You can't really know how truly awful it is until you've been a server. I would work 12 hour days without enough time for a break or lunch, constantly on my feet moving throughout the restaurant serving six or more tables at any given time. When it gets that busy, people get irate because they don't get served in time. The servers' job is not only to carry plates. You have to keep a lot of people happy, keep their drinks filled, check to make sure they have everything they need at basically any given moment during their meal.  You're absolutely insane if you think servers get paid too much. Please, *try* to be a server for a month and you'll completely change your mind.
Yeah, I'm on ps3 and it cuts out for me nearly every game. It's literally game breaking for me. I heard a *rumor* that it would be extremely difficult to fix, however I doubt it's true. We just have to keep on playing until DICE gives us something
Longest headshot or longest headshot on a chopper pilot?
Was this a parody/joke they were doing for the class? Or were they serious?
To all current or future Subway employees:  *Coat* the bread rolls in herbs, don't just dip one side in, they're so much better that way.  Proof to about 13", they shrink when they bake.  Always wipe excess cheese off the baking forms, it'll save *literally* hours of cleaning later  Last, bake them so that they're light brown, still visibly green from the herbs, and the cheese isn't burnt. You all suck at this part a lot and the bread tastes awful because of it.  I was a Sandwich Artist at Subway, and I put the art in artist.
Oh ok, forgot that variable. Thanks for making it known
I never really play hardcore. Idk why. It's not like it's too difficult, it's just less fun for me. You enjoy it more?
Any special "Oh God I'm going to die!" Moments?   I would like to hear any of your more unusual moments where your first reaction drenched you in the fear that you would soon meet your demise, but your valorous Battlefieldian mindset brought you through to victory. Here's mine:  Today I was capturing point Bravo on Caspian Border, when a large tree on the C side of the capture point was knocked down somehow. The tree pinned my soldier so I could run around between the branches, but I was trapped within them until it disappeared. In all of my long hours since the game released in October, this has never happened to me. Meanwhile, through the brush, I witnessed a jeep with two men drive up, and a third soft target following close behind. I quickly threw on my big boy pants, locked and loaded, and screamed my war cry as I fired on the jeep's driver first, killing him, then his gunner, with a few (probably lucky) shots. The third man discovered my hideout but I used my prison to my advantage, using the branches as a shield, successfully luring him one way so that I could shoot him in the back and rain victorious, just prior to the tree vanishing. I successfully held Bravo while hiding in what I had assumed would be my grave, and now I want to hear your stories. Anything is fine, but preferably the strange.
Bet she is looking in the right places.
Need some quick advice as a noob.   I've been playing as a monk, but never playing alone. Fighting everything is easy. Now that I'm trying to play a bit of the game solo, it's not as easy. I started a new character as a barbarian, and while it is easy, I'm still afraid I'm not doing it right. My only question is, how do I fight a boss where it's 1v1, when I have to get up close and hammer him? Do I just have to rely on healing potions? I'm about level 9 and getting close to fighting the skeleton king. Any advice would be great!
