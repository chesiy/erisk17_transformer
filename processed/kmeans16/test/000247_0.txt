If you take out factory farming, the numbers change considerably. Just because the most popular method for producing meat is harmful doesn't mean they all are. Here is a detailed article going into depth on why pasture grazing is needed. Pasture grazing creates critical habitat for many species.  The reason these cruel factory farms exist is because they are efficient. Yes, there may be more diversity when allowing cattle to graze on uncultivated grasslands, but it comes at a far larger cost of land, and [higher greenhouse gas emissions](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2535638/):  Adding the carbon debt resulting from the additional cleared land required by the two-thirds less efficient grass finishing process (26.6 million acres  10,400 lb/acre/year, or 276.6 billion lb/year) results in the organic system totaling 770 billion lb of CO2-equivalent GHG emissions; or 58% higher than the conventional systems total of 487.5 billion lb.
I think this is one more important step to getting people to change their eating habits. People are aware of the terrible cruelty to animals that happens on these farms. People are increasingly becoming aware of the large environmental impact of raising animals for food (not just in terms of global warming but they also require a lot of water and produce a lot of waste, far more than we could ever appropriately use as fertilizer, which leads to runoff, pollution of drinking water, and dead zones). People know that there are many healthier and often more affordable alternatives to animal products available. People are increasingly worried about antibiotic resistant bacteria and other health hazards created by factory farms. Adding this outbreak will only hasten the shift toward alternatives.  Per capita meat consumption in the US is down by about 10% since 2007. People do care about the huge negative consequences of animal agriculture, and within the next 10-20 years we will see some substantial progress.
Like a dairy cow, a pig uses its tail not only to shoo away insects but also to communicate. Like dogs, pigs wag their tails when they are happy, twitch them when they are nervous, let them drop straight down when they are sick. They may stick them straight out behind them when they are frightened or alarmed.

Falafel with Avocado Cream   Tahini Mayo   [Final Result](http://i.imgur.com/wIuxb6p.jpg)  **Ingredients**  * 1 can chickpeas, reserving a small handful for the avocado cream (you can cook dried ones as well) * 3 cloves garlic * 1 small onion * 2 teaspoons ground cumin * A BIG bunch of both fresh parsley and coriander * Salt and pepper * 2 Tablespoons olive oil * 3/4 cup chickpea flour (sometimes called gram flour) * Burger buns and fresh tomato for serving  **For the avocado cream and tahini mayo**  * 1 avocado * A small handful chickpeas left from can * A bunch of fresh parsley * 1 garlic clove * 2 tablespoons tahini * The juice of one lemon * 2 tablespoons water  **Directions**  Throw your chickpeas, peeled garlic, onion, cumin and salt and pepper into a food processor and pulse until roughly blended. Youll need to scrape down the sides. Now add in the fresh herbs, oil and flour and blend until you have a nice thick texture, but it will still be fairly moist. Place into a bowl and if you need, add a little more flour to help the mixture bind as you form them into the patties. Make them small or big as you prefer. In a flat frying pan, heat about half an inch of oil over medium to high and add in your burgers. Cook for about 4 -5 minutes on both sides and once they are on their second turn, press them gently to make them flatter if you need. They should turn a nice dark, golden brown and smell divine!  For the avocado cream, simply add to your processor the avocado (without skin of course!), the remaining chickpeas, parsley and 1 garlic clove and blend until smooth. For the tahini mayo, drop the two tablespoons of tahini into a small bowl with the lemon juice and water and whisk with folk until you have a creamy consistency.  Toast the bun, add the burger, then the avocado, then a slice of tomato and finish with the oozy, lovely tahini mayo!
Male chickens do not lay eggs, and the males of the egg laying variety do not grow fast enough to be worth raising for meat either. These chickens are commonly ground up alive [as can be seen in this short video clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huVJDWaKrxM) or explained in more detail [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN0g13kMk6s). Some other places may simply throw the birds into large trash bags to suffocate.  The hens themselves frequently live in terrible conditions even in facilities that try to advertise themselves as being more humane. [Here are pictures of free-range, cage-free, and organic egg laying operations](http://imgur.com/a/fp7C0). Even on the nicest farms though, the hens' egg production begins to drop off after a couple years of age and they will be sent to slaughter. There is no economic way to let these animals live out their entire lives. [Here is a picture showing how old various animals usually are when slaughtered](http://i.imgur.com/LLyM10R.jpg).
I see an important role for both within the animal rights movement. People are more charitable when talking to someone face to face that they can see and identify with. We can pick up on social cues that may not be available online and better tailor our responses to people.  Online we have the advantage of being able to cite sources, and have our comments or posts seen by a much wider audience. [Here is a link that I posted the day I left on my trip](http://imgur.com/nsFUwJ1). It has been viewed 3.1 million times. I could never reach that many people in person, but online I have been able to post share several items a month that get over a million views. These images can't replace a full conversation with someone, but they have absolutely succeeded in starting many conversations and giving many people a slight nudge in the direction of veganism.   If I was choosing which area I think we can make a larger impact with the same amount of effort, I would say online activism, if done well, is a better use of most people's efforts at this time.
I enjoyed the taste of meat, but I wasn't okay with the things that were being done to animals in order for traditional meats to be produced. Things that taste like meat, but don't cause harm to animals are a win-win!
You went from a bad justification to a terrible justification. It is not okay to pay people to abuse animals and slaughter them just because you enjoy it. You need to take into account both your enjoyment as well as the harm your actions cause to others in order to make an ethical decision.  The food chain is not an ethical theory (and you won't be any more likely to get eaten by other animals if you choose to eat less meat).   There is no reason to say reactionary nonsense just because you don't like what /u/The_Same_Sun was saying.
/r/summerscavengerhunt  This year's competition just started today and runs through the end of August. Anyone can join. It is a ton of fun!
That doesn't look anything like [the picture you shared yesterday](http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/107/a/1/shaquille_oatmeal_by_edflores1-d3e6ibw.png).
[Here's a pro-GMO vegan Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/VeganGMO)
Every major dietary organization in the world has published statements saying appropriately planned vegan diets are healthy for all stages of life. Anyone who rejects that is radically outside of the overwhelming scientific consensus.  **[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**   It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.  **[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**   A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.  **[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**   With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.  **[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**   A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.  **[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**   Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.  **[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**   Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.  **[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**   Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians, these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.  **[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**    A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.  **[The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada](http://www.heartandstroke.com/site/c.ikIQLcMWJtE/b.3484249/k.2F6C/Healthy_living__Vegetarian_diets.htm)**   Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can provide all the nutrients you need at any age, as well as some additional health benefits.

The Life You Can Save, and the other effective altruism work of yours that I have seen, seem to focus predominately on mitigating terrible cases of human suffering, which is undoubtedly an important cause. However, it seems quite likely that each of us can do much more with the same amount of resources to mitigate animal suffering. A good deal of your other work has addressed the issue of speciesism and the importance of animal rights in living an ethical life, but the work on effective altruism within the animal rights movement (for example the work done by [Animal Charity Evaluators](http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/recommendations/top-charities/)) seems to be more of an afterthought. Why have you chosen to focus much more specifically on humans in your recent work?
Of course the legislature should only pass laws if there is a good reason for them. That isn't what this amendment is going to ensure. It will instead provide a basis for large agricultural interests to legally challenge laws they don't like in court. You wouldn't only need to convince a majority of legislators and the governor to pass a law, you also need to prove it to a judge, and if he or she sides with you then another judge on appeal. At the same time laws that favor big ag without good public reason will go unchallenged, and those that only hurt smaller farms that cannot afford the legal costs will go unchallenged too. This is an amendment designed to enshrine big business interests in the state's constitution.
