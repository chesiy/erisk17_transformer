I was there last year too, spent 2 weeks in a hospital. Unfortunately I hadn't started smoking regularly yet so I can't imagine how great that first hit must have felt... keep your chin up! I'm always here if you need someone to talk to or anything Like that :)
it was actually my information she was giving out... this is so good to hear. oh my god. (at least I think, a while back I got into an argument on tumblr with a SJW and they started giving out my info and it lead to a whole thing, police and everything)
She's also just made a movie, which came out yesterday called Camp Takota :)
If I only I didn't have so much shit to wrap :(
