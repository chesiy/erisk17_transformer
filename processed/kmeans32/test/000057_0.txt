Well, I guess it is time. Hello gray friend!
Thank you very much for your input. I am just beginning my project so I am just trying to collect some raw data at this point. Later on down the road would you and some of your classmates be willing to fill out a questionnaire at some point? It probably wouldn't be for awhile.  I think the key for both fields to work together is to find common ground and to learn more about the other field. I think too often naturopaths are labeled as not using evidence and allopaths are labeled as pill pushers too busy for their patients. Common ground is easy, we both want what is best for patients. As for the later, what is a good resource for learning about evidence of naturopathy? I have read a little bit on UpToDate and we did have a lecture about natural remedies in my pharmacology class.     *Edit*: Do you know of other good forums/resources where I could talk with other naturopaths and patients?

More than likely not. There would be a lot more blood because the explosion would have to go through a lot of body parts and vessels which all would have been pushed into the air. Plus there is a lot of connective tissue around the intestines so they would look clumpier.   Source: have dissected people

No recess reference here? Dang. This is obviously swing kid all grown up.
I'm sorry to hear that. That sounds excruciatingly painful. Was it an LFT? That is a common liver test that can be indicative of gallbladder problems. Have they talked about having the dumb thing removed?
Hahahaha, this happened to me! Also I had a hot ultra sound nurse examine me... That was awkward.
I always knew it as just 'telephone'. Is that irony?
Not sure why you are being down voted, Mallory Weis tears are a probable diagnosis. Although I think they occur with more severe initial vomiting such as alcoholism.

/u/DMRage, It seems you have found yourself in the Vikings Bridgewater circlejerk! Welcome my friend! Here we believe... no... we know Teddy will be the greatest Viking since Leif Erikson (hinga dinga durrrga). All posts denying our bridge over troubled water will be mercilessly down voted by delirious Vikings fans who have nothing to do but root against the Packers, and scan all forums for talks of how great Teddy is. So grab a Grainbelt, serve yourself some luttefisk, and get ready to put what little hope you have for football enjoyment into the T man himself. Because we just can't take another dissapointment.

Reddit has changed. The top comment of an article was almost always the counter argument to the link. This would allow the reader to get a full perspective on the topic. Now it is usually occupied with circle jerking reinforcement (i.e, all the anti-Muslim posts over the last 36 hours).  I am not taking either side on this issue, I am just disappointed I had to scroll this far down for a counter argument.  Inb4 "le noob month old reddit account talks about the good ol days hue hue hue", I deleted my old account because it had an offensive connotation.

Did they run that double move for this throw?
Samesies with you guys. Bears are my least favorite, because Cutler.

Thanks for the reply. Wow that is an awful, terrible rule. I feel bad for the Packers. What is the reasoning behind that?
No stream access, what was the play and rule that ruled it a safety?
WARNING: Do not click with mobile. There was a very persistent pop-up and I had to clear my browser history to make it stop. It was mildly annoying.
Haha, that was what I was hoping for. It would be a warning sign to anyone who knew some anatomy that it was all bull.
Good simulations to practice with?   Hey all, anyone know of a good simulator to practice with? Something that has a patient presentation and you need to gather history, perform an exam, give meds and the simulation will respond accordingly?
Sorry to butt in, but this is obvious.
Subtle. I like it.
