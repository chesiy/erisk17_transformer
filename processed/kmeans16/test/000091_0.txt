if you replace each pair with its new number value (frequency) you get:  462746274614 461546272 4615227 4614462719 19275 461546271927 46141915 19275 4631927 4615463 461446274627 4614192746 19275 46144614 4615463 4614192746 46141915 4614462719 19275 4615461446 461546271927 46151914 461546272 4614462719 461546154627 4615227 4614192746 461519274627 191 19275
Since OP said looking at frequency is a good idea, I looked at how many times each pair was repeated.  A0 = 46 A1 = 27  B0 = 19 B1 = 15  C0 = 2 C1 = 14  D0 = 2 D1 = 3  E0 = 5 E1 = 0  F0 = 0 F1 = 1  idk maybe this means something

I love this track! I've been working on it a bit and I think I have some lyrics that could work, but it would really help if you sent me some lyrical ideas. I really hope I get to record over this track, it's honestly so good.

[High School Global Perspectives] Need some opinions and perspectives about Syrian Refugees for project?   What is your perspective on whether or not the U.S Foreign Aid towards the Syrian refugees has been sufficient? (Opinions on Obama and Syrian Refugees)   For a school project (iGCSE GP), I need to get a range of opinions.-so I thought Reddit would be a good place to come to. What are your opinions on how The US and/or other countries have handled the issue and Syria and how they have/should have dealt with the issue of refugees? Also feel free to add any information on the topic too. If you don't mind, I would appreciate of you stated your culture/home country since I need to show I have opinions from a variety of backgrounds. Thank you so much :)
You should've deleted everything dude. And boy am I glad I didn't comment on the last two posts. Call the police is all I have to say. Good luck OP.
