r/books, do your reading preferences ever change?   For example, I've gone from preferring to read in silence to enjoying reading the most when I have some background music or noise playing.
If you like Star Wars, you gotta read the thrawn trilogy. The story is easy to get sucked into, and in my opinion, Grand Admiral Thrawn is sooo much better and more terrifying of a villain than the emperor or lord vader.
When hot coffee or tea is at the perfect temperature that lets you sip your drink without burning your tongue.
When you think "oh, man..." instead of "oh, man!" when you seem him/her.
Do not trust a person who buys unfrosted poptarts.
An ellipsis... Is not always necessary
Girls with boyish haircuts. The last girl I dated had bleach blonde hair cut to angsty-teenage-boy, and goddamn, she made me harder than a tank made of wolverine's bones.
Wow, your response definitely brings an important perspective to the conversation. If the following is too personal to answer, please feel free to not respond: what is it like having people look down at you for following orders that you couldn't break? It's easy enough to say what is the right or wrong thing to do when you're thousands of miles away from the conflict, but I cannot imagine what it's like having to face those delimas during a battle situation.
My basement. During the day, I just see it as the lower part of my house. But at night, it may as well be the opening to the worst circle of hell!
When people think I'm a slacker just because I smoke weed. I'm not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but I finished my first year of college with all A's - albeit a few were A minuses - and have always worked hard to stay on top of my life's various workloads like job tasks, household chores, and responding promptly to both professional and casual messages. Bonus exasperation points if the person who is lecturing me is a person with poor work ethic but thinks s/he is superior because s/he doesn't smoke.
That technique works wonders in r/news and r/worldnews as well.
To be fair, I've known plenty of guys who have made a tinder account for the same reason. But I do agree that their are some super shitty people on those apps. Congrats on finding your SO by the way!
I think that viewing this situation in an empathetic manner is key. We should be empathetic for op who is a person who happens to be a guy; it's unfortunate that he was labeled as a rapist/sexual predator/etc. simply because he was walking in the same direction as a person who is a woman was walking. We should also be empathetic for the person who is a woman, however, because her feeling threatened by such a little thing is also unfortunate. While I am in no way condoning her being rude afterwards - wrongly accusing someone as being something as heinous as a sexual predator is not something that should just be brushed off and ignored because such a title carries significant social and legal repercussions for the person receiving the title - the fact that we live in a world where such caution needs to be taken shows that a problem of how we as a society handle sexual assault - both in terms of the treatment of the victims of the crime and the people who are wrongfully accused of committing or planning to commit such inhuman acts - does exist. In my perfect world, people who are women would not have to always feel fearful of being the victims of rape/sexual assualt/etc and people who are men would not have to live in fear of having their benign actions being viewed as lecherous motives.
I read your title in Captain Price's voice.
The cat and the fat sack?
What are your favorite games to play while high?   I enjoy twin stick shooters such as Super Stardust HD.
I'm high and feel as if I'm seeing 3D for the first time in my life.
Aww, thanks!
Thank you!
Damn, number 19 should be out breaking hearts, not fighting wars.
I appreciate your enthusiasm and support, but I think you should be careful about making broad, sweeping statements about either gender. Both genders have experienced hardship and unfairness. And while the individuals in our situations were acting rudely, they do not portray the definitive character of their gender; they were simply being jerks.
I appreciate your politeness and helpfulness!

Nice! How would i do that?
To me, magnanimous has a kind of rugged beauty like that of a handsome mountain man or grizzled soldier.

This place is in Bozeman, but I do love Missoula!
That is the first time I've heard of that sensation! It does sound more enjoyable than the spins, though.
Who is your favorite marvel villian? Why is he or she your favorite?
Have you ever experienced an 11? I appreciated the picture!
