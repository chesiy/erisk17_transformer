[FREE] Cat Simulator, upgraded graphics   Hey! Offering to check out this free app. We've been working on polishing this game's graphics because realistic cats are the key to success; that's the latest version.

What's your star-crossed favorite meal (aka delicious food you only tasted once or twice and can't find/recreate now)?   Because I'm pining for takoyaki again.
WTRW you want a story about several generations of the same family?   Searching for something along the lines of Zola's "Rougon-Macquart" or Galsworthy's "Forsyte Saga". It doesn't have to be a book series though, a solitary novel works just as well.

Good advice! The only thing, I find it rather awkward to start conversations by simply marching up and introducing myself. Making some comment/observation about the situation we're both in (it's cold, the queue barely moves, the coffee is great here) and going from there works better for me. If the conversation doesn't run into the ground after a couple of lines, slipping the introduction in somehwhere along the way is easy enough.
