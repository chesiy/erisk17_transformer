I'll make a vid tomorrow night when I get back to the countryside.  Here's some love from Sweden in the meanwhile.  [ABBA](https://youtu.be/uP0sC_s5EfE)  I'm pretty sure that when media gets that the next president of the united states (touch wood) have mentioned Sweden as well as other Scandinavian countries as models for healthcare and education it's gonna flood our news.  We are mighty proud of our healthcare system. And we love to hear the praise of it.
I'm sorry. That was a good comment you linked to. I didn't go that far back as to more than a *month back in time* But I still didn't see a post from you in this sub, and the few ones I saw on the subject of Bernie were strangely familiarly formulated not discussing any policy of his. Just broad key words like socialism, anti globalism, stagnated economy. Etc, etc.   I didn't accuse you in that sense. It's just there has been A LOT of fresh accounts coming here trying to cool things down. And when you didn't answer my question if you think Bernie has got enough name recognition but instead talked about how neutral you are  I began suspecting something was wrong. And I waited a good while before I said something about it.   I just thought that everyone agreed what Bernie's main concern is, is a certain other runner's name recognition that Bernie really lack. And found it weird you didn't think so.   Not everyone needs to be a vocal supporter. I don't think that.   I'm sorry if I offended you. I hope we can put our "pitchforks"  down and be civil. You seem like a good guy that stand up for what you believe. And hopefully we can end this discussion here on good terms because I really don't have time to do this anymore.
I'm watching it now. Yeah. It's like he cares. Feels weird.  Europe too huh? :)  edit: Don't forget to post the video directly here on this sub so that it can get some well deserved attention.
Vrlden kommer inte att hlla om det ska fungera s fr all evighet. Den kommer iallafall inte vara en vrld jag vill leva i om den fortstter i samma riktning.. Men misstrsta inte. Alla generationer har kmpat mot ngot som verkat helt overvinnerligt. Om det s var kvinnlig rstrtt, rtten att lska vilken person man vill oavsett kn, svartas frihet eller frmgenhetsklyftan s har det alltid funnits folk som sttt upp fr det som varit rtt. Ofta mot alla odds. Med mngder av mnniskor som psttt att de aldrig kommer lyckas. Men de som sttt upp fr rttvisan har vunnit till slut. Efter att mnga har kmpat sig snder och samman har vrlden till slut blivit en bttre plats.  Att stta sig ner och tjura r inte rtt instllning. Inte heller att frga hur det ska gras. Problem r till fr att lsas. Och det kan vi inte gra p Reddit. Vi mste tala om detta med mnniskor. Det mste bli ett mne som ligger p folks tunga och vill gra sig hrt.  **Detta r min sikt**
I'm just quoting those who mindlessly agree on something. If they really do think it is bullshit why not explain why they think that way? If I'm mission your point. Please do elaborate. I would like to understand you. And sorry if my english is bad. It's my second language.
Conspiracy. I smell conspiracy.
I have a bit of homemade tinfoil. Noone believes me, but I'm fairly certain there is something to it, but maybe not what I think. Anyway.   Bran climbed the walls of Winterfell so many times that he knew every rock.   He has gotten better and better at warging Hodor. It will culminate with Bran somehow warging/influencing Ser Duncan the Tall. Thick as a **castle wall**  My theory is rooted in Bran's nagging about wanting to be a knight, people telling him he can't ever be. But Dunk was never knighted!  And a line from The Sworn Sword. when Dunk defies his sworn lord and sends the poor villagers home, practically saving their lives. "It was if some god had put the words in my mouth. Not the warrior".
I find let's plays without narrating a bit pointless. But I understand, it's hard to find something to talk about and I think Scott Manley got it right with the "New me" and "Old me". That way you can put voiceover where you blabber about pointless things, say something stupid. Or such :)  Also, fastforward your launches. I get tired by just watching my own, again and again! ^^  Anpther tip is to do a better description. List your mods and stuff and do a short summery of what the episode is all about.   Otherwise I really liked the video and the creations.
Took me about 12 hours to manage the same. But I had a dude guiding me when I needed some help. Congratulations on your accomplishment!   The amazing feeling you felt when you landed will happen again, and again and again. That's the beauty of this game!
I'd like it if he got decent with his left hand. But we all know where our hopes end up..  (insert witty quote here)
Maybe! You'll have to wait and see.
Because Baelish says "I know, I know" in a certain way. Could be nothing though, but I made the thread because there are bound to be others I have missed, and someone has certainly picked one or two up.
(spoilers all) Book references in the show!   A lot of cool characters are cut from the books, but I think the writers plant references and homages to characters they had to leave out. My find is the scene when Tyrion and Littlefinger are talking about rewarding Podrick Payne in S03E03  This caught my attention.  T: "did fuck her once."  B: "I know."  T: "But we don't."  B: "I know"  Baelish changed his voice in a way that made me think it was a reference to Patchface. I don't know if it is something everyone noticed but I was pretty astonished!
With the growing tension in the realm and concidering the incident at Duskendale 276AC. I Lord Burk Cinder of House Cinder wishes to swear fealty to you, Lord Sheridan. The new Lord of the Vale. My ancestors have lived in these mountains since the Dawn Age. And we wish you to consider us some of your most loyal bannermen,  The King has not been seen leaving the Red Keep for 4 years. Stange tales are being told about his mental health. We must stand together to face the times to come.   **The Vale must prevail!**
Considering this post is at the top of Reddit, and it is such a valid request, I would see it as a terrible sign if CA doesn't take the advice and release a demo of some sort.   **They won't get a preorder from me if they don't release a preview! And I know friends who feel the same.**  They aren't very careful with their reputation.
I had a complete ship with batteries and solar panels, but when it didn't work the first time I made a new save file in sandbox to see if it was a technology problem. Didn't put that much effort into the test rocket.   The speed was probably due to "limit to terminal velocity".  Added stuff electrical stuff, and changed the turn shape a little.  New picture shows altitude at 62 000 km. past the node at 75 000 and now descending. Still not working. :(  http://imgur.com/GbtAZlt
