Being self employed has its perks sometimes ...
I have my base set up similar to the linked screenie in smuttyinkspot's post, maybe with defenses more closely together, and more mines on the sides to discourage flanking. The weakness in this kind of base design is always the flanks, as once you get past the front defenses towards the production buildings at the back, it's game over basically. The advantage is that attackers are overwhelmed the minute they set foot on the beach, so they have to spend a lot of GBE destroying defenses before they land.  I leveled up the HQ and then upgraded the shock launcher as a priority, as its relatively large coverage wreaks havoc with attackers with this kind of denser base design.  To defend against warriors, you might want to upgrade the flamethrowers and have them closer to your HQ, along with upgraded machine guns. The flamethrowers are currently too far away and can only do damage to one side of the HQ for each flamethrower, as opposed to all four sides at the same time when placed right next to the HQ. Also wouldn't hurt to have more high DPS defenses covering the HQ, to pick off the warriors in a single shot.  Also for the OP, you have a pretty high VP count for your level - it's gonna be tough to defend bases against players that are leveled to the high 40s, regardless of your strategy. So focus on upgrading your defenses if you find you're losing most of the loot you earn to home base attacks (I prioritized upgrading boom cannons, sniper towers, cannons, rocket launchers, flamethrowers around the HQ, machine guns around the HQ in this order before I got to level 17 and got the shock launcher).

I don't think the pedestrian auto braking would have worked anyway if the driver had his foot on the accelerator (all of these auto braking systems allow the driver to override it if they choose to).

Welcome to the club!   I've found my Blu-ray buying rate halved since I started using Netflix (been geo-dodging for two years now). I had been wasting a lot of money on crappy movies, just because I wanted something new to watch. Netflix is now my source for all things crappy.   The money I've saved have gone into going to the movies or buying movies that I actually like, thus reducing my pirated download rate as well.

Simsville Mayor Peter Less: We Can Do Better (Spoof)
There are lots of things you can do after you've built a profitable city.   For example, try a different profit strategy. A different layout. Gift away some of your cash to make your vision of utopia (one that's a dream to live in, but may have to rely on continuing gifts). If you're not playing with others, perhaps take on an entire region by yourself and build all the different types of specialized cities (electronic, mining, oil, tourism, gambling ...).  In a way, you can't really win with games like SimCity. It's all about showing off your creativity, what you can do to make your city different from other people's. Some of the game mechanics do limit your freedom a lot, especially if you want sustainable cities, but if you do have a ton of cash that you can gift away, then that frees up some of the things you can do.

Heh, thanks!  As for the llama problem, perhaps a llama map layer might help to identify the source of all these llama infestations.

My SimCity spoof news website: The Simsville Bugle
It's how the North Koreans do it!
Meet the new bugs, same as (or worse than) the old bugs.
So we'll have to wait until they fix the new bugs introduced from their attempt to fix the old bugs? Definitely gonna take a break from the game to wait for more fixes ... hopefully the wait won't be indefinite! Sigh ...
