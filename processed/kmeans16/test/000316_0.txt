Cocaine is a helluva drug
The suspected shooter is still at large, according to the Charleston Police Department's Twitter. Police described the suspect as a white male, approximately 21 years old, with a slender build. They also indicated he is believed to be wearing a gray sweatshirt, blue jeans and Timberland boots.
This is a perfect depiction of the united states under the GOP threat. Class warfare, abysmal treatment of those who do the fucking work. I'm past the point for having pity for the stupid fucks who vote GOP. Now I consider them part of the threat.
I haven't been but I am way more paranoid about it post-legalization than I ever was for the 2 decades when pot was illegal. Definitely think that CO plates are profiled. I was actually told by the cashier at  Target (discussing going on a drive out of state) that I should be prepared, they pull over Colorado cars at the border. She was talking about going north out of CO. I thought it was a weird convo to have with an older woman cashier at Target, but hey.
Yep. And we lose them at 5-6.
Really, if someone attacks him politically I'd be baffled as to why; he was a fairly well-rounded guy and had pretty much something that everyone could admire, IMO.

This photo is today at the TX capital. Thank you to the people who showed up to testify.
My heart goes out to the family. The horror of the two younger children watching their father and older sister massacred by someone will affect them for life, I'm a mother as well and cannot fathom, yet the fact that I do imagine it makes me work harder to ensure we put an end to this kind of terrorism we are all threatened with daily in the US. No other developed nation has this kind of crazy gun violence taking out citizens on the daily and yet not a peep from those in charge of keeping the safety. I didn't hear any politicians comment on this at all; not one mention.   As the mother's brother said, "no one needs a gun." He implored people to stop praying for an end to gun violence and take action
A woman had a bullet in her neck, the third of 7 shattered window incidents. Have you got a source that this is not bullets? Do share if so. Otherwise all accounts point to an ammosexual.
A man who declined to be identified told a Reuters photographer that a teenaged girl in a nightgown came to his house, running barefoot through a snowy wooded area and crying that her parents had been shot. They called police and law enforcement officials found her parents dead at their home.  Authorities said they later discovered five other people dead and a wounded woman in three other houses. The woman, who is expected to recover, gave them information about the shooter, Texas County Sheriff James Sigman said.  Four of the victims were identified as Garold Aldridge, 52, his wife Julie Aldridge, 47, Harold Aldridge, 50, and his wife Janell Aldridge, 48.  Authorities would not identify the other victims, but the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that they were Carey Shriver and his wife Valirea Shriver, and Carey's father Darrell Shriver. Darrell's wife Martha was wounded but survived, the paper said.
Fairly sure the three older siblings who witnessed it will end up cluing him in. All four kids witnessed the shooting. From the articles I've read it sounds like there are guns everywhere in this family. Hoping law enforcement at the very least removes the guns from the home, since they clearly put the children at risk.
It's abhorrent. As a parent in the US, I am uncomfortable sending my child anywhere without a drastic change to our lack of gun regulation. We lose an average of 82 citizens a day to gun violence.   [Each year, more than 30,000 Americans die in gun suicides, homicides, and unintentional shootings as a result of the ready availability, and accessibility, of specific classes of firearms. Gun violence is more than a crime issue; it is a broad-based public health crisis of which crime is merely the most recognized aspect.](http://www.vpc.org/aboutvpc.htm)
Oh man. That's the best - so hilarious!!! Eldest here, so I've been on the other end of a ruse or deuce.
Sorry, that's shitty And sad.
No, it doesn't matter if we know the name of the shooter. What matters is that he was known to be totally unbalanced and disturbed, yet was able to legally buy a fuckload of guns and ammo, and then keep those even when cops checked on him after tips that he was going to go off. What the actual fuck? Stop letting crazy people buy and own guns. Period.
No, it's the sanest thing he could say. To blame a gun, maybe a stretch. But the reason that certifiable nutters like the shooter can GET guns is the NRA and their beholden in congress. Just fucking make people prove they are not crazy before buying lethal weapons. What is so fucking hard about that concept? Yet the NRA blocks research, encourages insane responses from the fringes of their already-radical members, and fans the flames of these mass shootings. Fuck. How can anyone see this suffering beautiful father, his life FUCKING RUINED by a proven-crazy fucker who's family contacted the sheriff for fucks sake, and who was still, still able to procure a gun!- and argue against blocking crazy folks from buying and owning firearms?
