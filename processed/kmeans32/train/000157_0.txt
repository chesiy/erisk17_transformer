This is from Churro Borough, a ice cream/churro shop in Los Feliz in LA. They are the self-proclaimed place of the "original churro ice cream sandwich."
Coffee in Las Vegas   I'm moving to Las Vegas next week and I'm afraid there won't be any good coffee shops/roasters there. I've previously lived in very coffee-friendly cities, SF and LA, so I might be a little bit spoiled.   http://sprudge.com/jackpot-big-cash-payout-for-finca-las-vegas.html  This article is over 2 years old and I'm pretty sure there hasn't been any progress. Anyone have any suggestions or am I shit out of luck for the next 3 years??

It's a neurological condition that affects sensory perception. Patients see things that are smaller or larger than they actually are, but realize that this can't be real. There are also temporal effects such a time slowing down. It usually occurs before they fall asleep or after they wake up.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_in_wonderland_syndrome

you could try casein powder. I supposedly absorbs more slowly than whey.
I saw the same thing happen, except it was an average guy running full speed on the treadmill. It was very early in the morning so the gym was relatively empty. He slipped, and the treadmill shot him straight back, his towel flying into his face. Dazed and confused, he looked around to see if anyone saw. I did, but he didn't realize so he tried to get back on, without realizing that the treadmill was still on full speed. He slipped again, fell on his knees and got shit backwards into the stationary bikes. Probably one of the funniest things I've seen at the gym.
