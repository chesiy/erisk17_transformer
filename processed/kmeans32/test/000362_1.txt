I was 12 years old, never did drugs, but I encountered a very malicious presence in my grandmother's house.    It wasn't something I could see, but no matter how much I tried to convince myself I was just crazy and there wasn't actually anything there, the presence felt like pure evil and *made* my body react in such a way that I became filled with terror and flight.  My rational mind was literally just like what the ever loving fuck is going on?    I've heard of people who have a certain instinct that tells them something is wrong when they can't actually discern what it is, and this was just one of those times.  My body and instincts were telling me to *get the fuck away* from whatever was there, except that it was blocking the only doorway out of the kitchen.  Nothing happened, but it felt like it wanted to kill me.  It irrationally made me fear for my safety in a certain way.  The part that really cemented the idea of it being a demon of some sort instead of a panic attack, was that the feeling of apprehension and fear within me *didn't gradually wear off.  Its exit was as instantaneous as it had come*.  I didn't realize just how heavy the atmosphere had felt until 'it' left.  The room then felt so light again, and I was filled with relief.  I imagine the whole ordeal probably would have looked like I was insane to an outsider; I was crying and praying to god and trying to melt into the back counter.  It was both the strangest and scariest thing that has ever happened to me in my life.    The experience itself *did* happen to me.  The part that nobody would believe is that it was a demon.  I can't tell you with fact that it was a demon, but I can tell you that it felt like there was a malicious presence there, and I personally associate the idea of a 'malicious presence' with a demon.  I guess it could have been some kind of temporary, one time, vivid emotional hallucination.  I don't know.  I don't go chasing after ghosts and the supernatural.  Nothing like that has ever happened again, thankfully.
YOU BOYS LIKE MEXICO? **YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO**
[This item.](http://items.jellyneo.net/?go=itemshowitem=7108)  The item description totally brings it together.  xD
Oh yeah, *black liquorice*, another candy I hate  :P
I'm glad too, I really thought I was weird and alone on this.  :'D
...not everyone would be comfortable with it?  In fact I'd say the vast majority would feel uncomfortable.

Man can I just have this issue but in real life?  I'd love to not have to eat  xD
*Dysfunctional high five!*  Lol hi there.  It somehow makes me feel better that there is somebody else experiencing this.  Sometimes I get way too centric in my own world haha
I do have regrets of having given up on so many things, I just don't even know how to stick with something at this point.  Art is pretty much the only thing I ever keep in my life, but I frequently give up on those projects and such because of apathy.  I'd rather have learned to play the piano, something more exciting like that could probably keep my attention?  I dunno haha.  Most of my imagination is filled with what ifs and with a me that is much stronger than my actual self..
The way he raises his pitch gradually throughout is hilarious

DAMMIT I ALWAYS MISS THAT BITCH
lol I think it's a joke because of what's happening today
There is none, it never actually got released.  So I can't dress it up in dress to impress lol
He was willing to wait for me to be ready for sex, but I ended the relationship because I did not want to give him that impression.  I knew I would never want to be intimate with him like that, so I broke it off to avoid pulling him along.  I say that like it was a simple thing, but it was terribly sad.    Honestly, I'll not even consider dating another person unless they're asexual.  ):  It's just there aren't many asexual people out there, so the chances of me being alone are pretty high.
Fuck, if the [notice board](http://www.neopets.com/noticeboard.phtml) was still in working order I'd tell you to spend a couple mil to put up a notice at the top.  IMO that would be the best way to get someone's attention at this point  xD  But that's incredibly unconventional and silly.  What else is there to do?  It'd be better than a ticket, since it's not on-site related and Rico S. just closes them anyway...  ^^^I ^^^still ^^^can't ^^^have ^^^my ^^^gold ^^^kau  ^^^:c

...You're really comparing things online to racism in real life?  You are an idiot.
we really need a skunk vandagyre already, I'm pretty sure it'd be colored like a panda.  Don't you dare let me down JS, I saw how you fucked up the gold kau
I don't know what I did wrong??  You offended his dickish sensibilities
lol I'd do it haha
Huh, that's really weird O_o  just another mysterious glitchy thing about neopets I guess haha
263  :o
Not all pets had an unconverted option, unfortunately.  You probably just happened to have those pets  ):
*cringe* I checked on the pandora website and the minimum price is like 20-25 dollars per charm...  My grandma got me one of these bracelets with only four charms, so the minimum she would have had to pay would be at least over $100, right?  Now I feel like absolute shit because I literally never wear it.  ):
Perhaps some money in there as well in case of emergency?  It doesn't have to be much, but I've heard it's always good to have some money outside of your wallet stashed somewhere just in case.
Wait there's a neo group on facebook?  Can't you report that person to the group mod for scamming and get them removed?
"Sorry dad, my fucking dumbass friend changed the url when I got up to use the bathroom"  Come on OP
Premade userlookups that are good for showing off pets on side accounts?   Hi!  I have several pets on side accounts that I want to show off on my main account userlookup, but I'd like a lookup that was possibly kind of designed with this in mind?  Anybody know of any?
If you feed a pet at movie central when it is bloated:  http://www.neopets.com/moviecentral/  You will get the 'very bloated' status.  That should make it easier to get leftovers, or so I've heard.
Nice zap!  I'm working on zapping a poogle MSP on TWO accounts and it's not going so well  x_x  pray neoluck for me as well!
