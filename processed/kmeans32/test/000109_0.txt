[Completed]Jovian GasBags   Fun little Asteroids clone I made for the One Game A Month challenge. You are a spaceship pilot, sent to wipe out the hordes of Jovian GasBags infesting Jupiter's upper atmosphere. These jelly-fish like creatures float in the air, splitting apart under laser fire.  ##Controls *** Arrow keys/WASD to turn/thrust. Spacebar/Control to shoot. Press escape to pause while in game, M to mute the music, and R to restart quickly when you're on the death screen. The levels get harder and harder, and when you die your highscore is saved locally. ##Links *** [Game Link(itch.io)](http://deltaf1.itch.io/jovian-gasbags)   A windows build is available, as well as a source file, which can be run if you have the \*awesome\* game engine [LOVE](http://www.love2d.org) installed.          ##My info   *** [My twitter](https://twitter.com/StarhopperGames)   [My Ludum Dare games](http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/deltaf1/)

Thanks, it was created for the ludum dare 72 hour jam, so it's a little short and simple.  I wish you luck on this project.
I'm not sure I want to work on a project with such vague guidelines, but here's one of my [games made in LOVE](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-30/?action=preview uid=34574) anyway.
What an amazing throwaway name XD

try !gameMe (note the capital "M") I can change it to make it non case-sensitive if you'd like. Also you'll need to associate your account first.

Don't we all need a little ego-boosting from time to time? ;)  I can't really think of when it would be used either, but it'll be there if people want it.  (Also, I'm almost done now, so too late!)

Relevant XKCD https://xkcd.com/1102/
Are sunsets beautiful because it means we've survived another day?   I was driving home the other afternoon, as the sun went down. The light had begun to get redder, and the air to cool. I was feeling happy and relaxed, and then had a thought. What if sunsets are beautiful because it signifies another day survived? From an evolutionary perspective, we've evolved to feel good after surviving another day, which drives us to keep going. /notabiologist

Your bot could keep some kind of database with entries for every user it encounters, and the link to their wiki page. I'm not sure how you would go about creating the wiki page, but your biggest problem would probably be retroactively adding users who posted their first post before the bot became active.

Very pretty.
