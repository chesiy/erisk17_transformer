That wasn't my mom.   Note: This is a short, spoopy story that my 13 year old sister wrote and gave me permission to share. It's her first story and she's aspiring to be a writer when she gets out of school o3o.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  I hear a strange, blaring noise intrude it's way into my still-unconscious mind,it's only as my mind begins to wake, do my ears register the noise as my alarm clock.   Panic floods my body as I look at the clock and it's still screaming alarm. 7:30, I slept in.  I put on the clothes from last night, and rush downstairs to get something to eat, something quick or I'll be late for school.   "Good morning, honey!" A voice greets as I fumble down the stairs and rush through the living room and into the kitchen.   "Good morning mom"  I call back.   I grab a pack of cherry poptarts, grab my backpack and rush out the front door, bursting through it, just in time to barely catch the school bus as it's pulling away from the stop next to my house.   I drone my way through another day of school and catch the bus back home at the end of the day.   "Welcome home, honey!" My mothers voice greeted as a walked through the door.   "Hi" I reply before retreating up the stairs.   I do my homework and play a few hours of video games before bed, ignoring my mothers new and horrid taste in music that she's blaring as I do.   I jump in the shower and get ready for bed around 10pm, when my cellphone rings.   "Hello?" I answer  "Charlene?" the womans voice replies from the other end "I just wanted to let you know that your father and I are coming home early and will be back tomorrow morning"   I don't answer my mother as my eyes dart towards my door, my name is called from the hallway. Whatever is standing in front of my door, it's not my mother.
As far as I know, just bad housing market. The house is at the very end of a long dead end road and away from pretty much everything. So probably not a very good location for a lot of people.   I don't particularly like the location either, but the house was a cheap sale xD.
DEMON!  Dude, that's a stick  DEMON!  Dude...that's a dog   DEMON!  Dude! that's my girlfri-....nevermind, carry on.  Girlfriend: -_-
LOL this made me laugh harder than it should have.   "We believe the voice in the recording is saying "I'll kill your soul"  *What the ghost is actually saying*  "Have you seen my nacho cheese?"
Oh, we don't like Douchey Baganses, precious. No we don't.  But seriously, he's a pompous asshat who treats his "friends" like shit.    From what I've heard, he's also pretty much a fukwad to his fans too when he meets them.
Well, that's what happens when you're a violent paranoid Schizophrenic.  People tend to take you away.
I personally don't believe in stuff like that (the violent hauntings where people are choked or scratched)   Because it's just like stories of alien abductions (while I do believe in aliens, I don't believe they come to earth and do experiments on people) it's all the same story, there's never any differentiation in the stories and those are the kind that are really easy to make up.
That's creepy o3o. I love the Navajo culture but I never got too deep into the spiritual side of things their lore and their beliefs etc.   I did, however, forget one bit.   Apparently, up until my grandmother moved. She called my mother several times in hysterics, saying that "Yenaldlooshi is outside" or she'd leave messages saying "I'm not safe here, I have to leave. I will talk to you soon"  I don't remember that, I had to ask my mom about it. My mom doesn't even like to talk about it.   I do remember that apparently, several of my grandmothers neighbors also saw the same, large black dog over the course of several weeks.
Seriously? How about being less of a dick than you are now.
This one sticks out to me.   So when I was younger, I had this friend whose house was down the road from me. So I could literally walk there in a few minutes.  His house was this big, old Victorian style house that had been painted mostly red with a red shingle roof, we always joked and called it the barn house.   The two scariest locations in his house was his basement (this big, stone walled, dirt floor cellar) and his attic, which you couldn't actually get up into unless you accessed it through a hatch on the roof.   So being good friends, I would stay at his house for days at a time, even on week days when we had school because we got on the same bus and him being an only child, I felt bad for him having no one to hang out with.   His attic was super scary because every once in a while, you would hear what sounded like someone walking around in big, heavy work boots that would walk from one end of the attic to the other.   But his basement was even scarier, it only had a single light which hung from the center of the room, it was one of those pull chain lightbulbs. So it barely lit the room up.   Sometimes, at night, if you went into the kitchen, and if the door leading down to the basement was open, you'd be compelled to glance down into the darkness and sometimes (both of us as well as several of my friends cousins and some of our other friends had seen it as well) would see what looked like a tall figure wearing a cloak, standing at the bottom of the stairs.    Maybe the most memorable thing, though was when he found an old tape deck in the basement, the kind you could record tapes on, it wasn't a small tape recorder, it was one of those big things. Anyway it had a couple tapes with it, so one weekend while I was staying the night, me and him were playing around with it and recording ourselves having "interviews" with each other, stupid kid things.   Well, we then decided to erase the tapes and record ourselves sleeping, as he had decided to sleep in the living room with me. I think we wanted to see how many times we snored or something like that, I can't quite remember.   So we settled down and set the recorder on the table and eventually fell asleep.   The next morning, we listened through about two hours worth of recording, about 15 or so minutes of us talking back and forth before we finally fell asleep, and almost two hours in, very near the end of the tape, we heard this single, quiet, raspy voice that was so low you could barely hear it. It said something along the lines of "They're sleeping. Yes, they're sleeping. We shouldn't disturb them. Not tonight, we wait."  I remember the voice sounded something inhuman, it sounded almost like what Gollum sounds like in Lord of the rings, but much raspier and quieter.   It's one of those things that still sends shivers down my spine, and I wish one of us still had the tape.
There are actually some people that can smell pregnancy hormones.   They know someone is pregnant because they give off a slightly different natural smell.   I was like that when my ex GF was preggers, I could just "tell" she was pregnant before she even found out.   Unfortunately, what I was not able to tell was that the child wasn't mine. o3o

Why not? =O  I thought it was pretty creepy o3o
Can you imagine waking up and realizing you're not asleep anymore? =O  Happened to me this morning. and Yesterday and pretty much every day since the day I was born =(
The dog that wouldn't die. A story my grandma told me from her childhood   Yeah, this isn't as gruesome as the title says.   I was talking to my sister earlier and we were remembering some of the stuff from when my grandma was alive.   My grandma was born in 1936(she died two years ago)   There was a story I remember her telling my sister and I once that goes something like this.   When my grandma was a little girl, about 7 or so years old. Her dad found a scrawny little black dog. My grandmas dad according to her, was a big, tough guy that had a soft-spot for dogs, so he brought it home.   My grandma said that this little dog was really weird, it just walked around looking at everything or sat there staring into space, didn't bark, didn't play, and it barely ate, so it always stayed skinny. She also said it stunk constantly, no matter how many times they bathed it.   About a year after they found the dog, it got kicked by one of their horses (mind you she said this was a little terrier sized dog) Well, the dog simply got up, shrugged it off and walked away, when they checked the dog over, it had no broken bones at all.   A couple of years later, her mom accidentally ran the dog over with her car and the dog "died" so her dad took the dog out into the woods and buried it in a shallow grave and put a couple heavy branches over the grave so nothing could dig the dog up.   Two days later, they came home from church to find the dog sitting on their porch, covered in dirt but otherwise perfectly fine but after that, continued to stink like rotten meat, she said.   It got so bad that they had to keep the dog tied up outside.   The dog got attacked by a coyote and had it's eye punctured and one of it's ears ripped off. It acted like it didn't even phase it.   My grandma said that this little dog lived well into her young adult years (from the time she was about 7 to the time she was 20 or 21  During that time,  she said the dog had been shot twice, ran over again, kicked by two more horses and quilled by a porcupine.   It survived each event as if nothing happened.   She said the dog ran off when she moved out of her parents house and she never saw it again.   Edited for a couple spelling oopsies***
They're just playing, that's how they learn, that's also why it's *never* a good idea to give kittens away at 5-6 weeks old. between the ages of 5-9 weeks, they learn bite inhibition, they learn how rough they can and can't be.
