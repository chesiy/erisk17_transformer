and I hope I've made my point that if you treat "Wall Street defense firms" as toxic,  Well, I conceded earlier that isn't really the heart of the issue.  The problem is that Holder's staff *refused to investigate*  and refused to prosecute based  on criteria like "how it would hurt innocent employees and shareholders".  (That is almost a direct quote, if you'd read what I wrote in my comment).  Luckily, you get to dismiss me as "part of the problem" and tune out anything I might possibly say, because obviously I'm just a shill who couldn't possibly contribute anything of value  Don't whine at me that I'm being unfair when you're too lazy not just to watch the video, but even to read the short blog post I referenced that gives a precis of the video, or even, obviously to lazy to read the text in my actual comment.  There's more than enough in there to make my point.     If you're reflexively defending the revolving door, and refusing to even consider what someone is trying to show you, then yes, you are part of the problem.
What are you basing that on?    General election voter participation rate has been trending downwards since the 80s.  In 88 it was above 75%, now it is just breaking 60%.  At the same time we have the Congressional approval rating in history.    So 15% of the voting public have dropped out of the process because they don't believe their elected officials actually represent them (an idea [verified] (http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-echochambers-27074746 )  by political scientists).  That's a huge number of new voters that  might be reached by the right campaign.
Antibody wipeout relieves symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome
I think one of the biggest reasons to support her is the fact that the next president will likely nominate one, two or maybe even three judges to the supreme court (should they be a two term president).   Yeh, I totally hear you on that.   Forget all other issues for a moment.   That is exactly what the DLC is hoping we all do.  It's a devil's bargain.   Not voting or voting third party could easily hand the presidency to the GOP and we can't allow that to happen  You know, I'm genuinely torn on this.  On the one hand, you're absolutely right --- the Republicans will be a disaster zone.  On the other hand, so will Clinton --- just not as much.  And it's important we look at it from that perspective.    The American system has been tweaked by wealthy elites so that we now have two parties which serve the same basic interests, with small variations between the two to give the appearance of choice, like Coke versus Pepsi.  The more similar the two are, the more hot and intemperate the debate becomes on the side issues.    Gaming this out - if Clinton wins, it strengthens the hand of the DLC.  They'll argue that their economically right wing, hawkish policies are the only way that Democrats can win.  And the elites win again.  And from another perspective, pledging your vote to someone --- no matter what --- means that you've given up your bargaining power.  The reliable Democratic voter can be ignored.  That's why things keep drifting further and further right on the economic front.    Rachel Maddow had a great think piece on this several years back: http://www.salon.com/2011/04/05/democrats_51/   **The Republicans may not love their base, but they fear them and play to them.** The Democratic Party institutional structures of D.C., and the Beltway press in particular, not only hate the Democratic base  they think its good politics for Democratic politicians to kick that base publicly whenever possible.   Only the base itself will ever change that.
That's a sensible analysis, and without a doubt having the media and money on your side are a big part of winning the primaries.  However, another not insignificant part is whether primary voters actually agree with you.  This is where the similarities between Sanders and Paul break down.  Ron Paul, while wildly popular with Libertarian independents, took positions that put him at odds with GOP primary voters.  Namely, his positions on mass surveillance, drug laws and military intervention.  Large parts of the GOP base, and certainly the GOP money, found these ideas absolutely unacceptable - in fact, crazy-Uncle unacceptable.  Add to this the near total domination of right wing politics by Fox News, and it's hard to see how people ever thought he'd have a chance.  Sanders, on the other hand, champions policies which are what Democratic primary voters want, and this at a time when there is rising frustration with the direction the DLC leaders have taken the party.  Clinton's support for NAFTA, surveillance, war, and lobbyists put her directly at odds with the actual policy preferences of Democratic voters.  The "liberal" media, while still actually biased against Sander's brand of populist anti-corporate policies, is more diverse, and Democrats get their news from a wider variety of sources, many of which are online.  The debate is controlled, but less easily so on the Democratic side.    **TL;DR Many of Paul's policies were controversial with the base, but the opposite is true for Sanders.  Also, liberal media is more diverse than on the right, so Sanders has a chance of getting his message out.**
Griping about the media isn't going to get Sanders elected.  If we want to see him as President we should confront this challenge.
The reason this is possible is the same reason that workers everywhere (blue and white collar) are having wages stolen from them: unequal bargaining power.  The rich have little need for money, so they can be all that more demanding in contract terms, which leads to workers giving up more of their labor for less, and the wealthy becoming wealthier *because* they are wealthy.  This is not a natural system --- it was created this way.  Wealthy right wingers argue that we should socialize costs for the protection of property but not for anything else.  Of course, this just happens to benefit them the most.

6 Reasons Bernie Sanders Is a Better Candidate Than Hillary Clinton
Irish Wolf hound/German Shepherd?
Many great suggestions here, but some of my all time faves are missing.    Here are some I consider must-see films (on any list).  I think these each represent the greatest work by each of these directors:  1. Hidden Fortress (Kurosawa) - the inspiration for Star Wars. 2. Black Orpheus (Camus) 3. Contempt (Goddard) 4. Divorce Italian Style (Gremi) 5. The Seventh Seal (Bergman) 6. La Strada (Fellini)  I would have put Night of the Hunter up here, but someone already mentioned it.  And now some other fun ones, concentrating on things you may not have heard of:  7. The Game 8. Kwaidan - 3 incredibly beautiful Japanese horror stories 9. Sanjuro / Yojimbo (Kurosawa) - inspirations for Clint Eastwood's  "Man with No Name" classic films. 10. Seduced and Abandoned (Gremi) - if you enjoy Divorce Italian style 11. Spellbound (Hitchcock)
Our Galaxy May Be Littered With Dying Earths
I hear what you're saying, but for me it was obvious what Reagan was from day one.  And honestly, he was *hated* as evidenced by his terrible approval ratings.  After his death, the Republican propaganda machine kicked in to rehabilitate his reputation.  Let's not play into that fabricated meme.  Reagan was a lying and hated ideologue of the right who brought us the war on drugs, trickle down economics and had the most scandals of any President, with more officials in his government indicted or convicted than anyone else.  That's the only story that needs to play regarding him.
Look at their histories.  Obama had literally no track record *at all* of fighting for progressive policy.  At Harvard Law, he was known for intermediating between two sides.  At Kerry's nominating convention he gave a famous speech "One America, not two Americas", which advocated centrism and bipartisanship.  During the primaries he praised Reagan, supported  immunity of the telecom companies which participated in domestic spying programs, supported conserva-Dem Joe Lieberman over the excellent progressive Joe Lamont.    Obama even said that supporters were misconstruing him as a progressive.  He made a point of saying that "there are extremes on both sides" that are not helpful.   The man made it as clear as day that he was a centrist.  Voters were not paying attention.    Warren has had a *long* track record of fighting for the middle class.  She first came to public notice when, as a professor at Harvard, she gave a talk called ["The Coming Collapse of the Middle Class"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akVL7QY0S8A ).   It's worth watch in full.  Since then, Warren identified a part of the problem as the lack of accountability of the big banks, which allowed them to privatize their gambling risks and socialize their losses.  She pushed for a new Federal agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which makes regulations preventing financial institutions from cheating consumers.  Republicans prevented her from becoming head of the agency, but she won that major victory.  That agency is estimated to have saved consumers some billions of dollars in excessive charges (too lazy to provide a link, but easily googleable).  She has been extremely sharp-tongued in calling out Republicans.  She has not said "both sides are the problem".  She has even called out Obama and his centrist nominees, recently scuttling Wall Street stooge Antonio Weiss.  She's fought for cheaper loans for students ("If banks get .75%, why can't students get that too?").  Just do a bit of research on her.    The woman is a progressive firebrand that Obama never was and never said he was.
edit: I guess people do, it is dumb though  Why?  It's a pretty standard political phrase for identifying a faction in a political party by their ostensible leader.    E.g., "The Ted Cruz wing of the Republican party". http://newsbusters.org/blogs/tim-graham/2014/12/30/washpost-conservatives-slam-ted-cruz-wing-gop-too-much-clarity  And it's pretty much undisputed that Warren is seen as the leader of the progressives.
E.g., Israel.

**Submission Statement**  Covers recent studies from economists at Harvard, U Chicago et al. on the damage over financialization is doing to our economy.  Instead of being a generalized lament, the article describes some specific measures that demonstrate the point.  For instance, unlike other fields, where technological advancement has led to a decrease in fees, in finance, the opposite has happened.
All senior U.S. officials and CIA agents who authorized or carried out torture like waterboarding as part of former President George W. Bush's national security policy must be prosecuted, top U.N. officials said Wednesday
It's not a coverup, it's business as usual.  If there's a conspiracy, it's one that happens all the time, and is to be expected when colleagues are in charge of policing each other.  In fact, [while grand juries *almost always* indict, they frequently don't when the defendant is a police officer.]( http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/ferguson-michael-brown-indictment-darren-wilson/ )  Ironically, the right - which is constantly warning of Obama's jackbooted government thugs coming to take their guns away to Kenya - wants to change the conversation when the left points out systemic issues leading to an actual police state.    Prosecutors shouldn't be in charge of prosecuting their direct colleagues.  The glaring conflict of interest is producing the expected result, and the obvious moral hazard means cops act with impunity.  This isn't speculation - it's fact, and a situation which is being repeated constantly for obvious, logical reasons.  Body cameras are only a part of the solution. The next step is a law requiring  special prosecutors to deal with police criminality.

Warren is arguably one of them.  Not sure how much progress she can make by herself.  The conversation needs to change.  I think that's what she's trying to force the Ds to do.  (Focus on core economic issues, not distract people with social ones, like the Clintons/Obama).
Well put.
Au contraire - in fact, the author is quite liberal, and once wrote a column which appeared in WaPo during the Bush years called "White House Watch".  It so pissed off the Neocon editorial staff there that [the WaPo ombudsman was forced to address the controversy](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/10/AR2005121000938.html ):   Political reporters at The Post don't like WPNI columnist Dan Froomkin's "White House Briefing," which is highly opinionated and liberal. They're afraid that some readers think that Froomkin is a Post White House reporter.

That code was a joke, but, having worked on several different reasoning systems, I don't see how any of them could ever be considered conscious.      No not at all, considering we are a few pounds of soft grey spongy material.   But it's not clear what kind of physics is going on in there.  (And no, I don't believe in Hameroff's microtubule nonsense).    What is clear, however, is that any of the most sophisticated AI reasoners that you could run on the fastest digital computer around today could also run on this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40DkJ9vt5CI (Please watch) - where the physics is clear, and obviously doesn't invoke consciousness.  To say that thing is conscious just doesn't pass the giggle test.    Have you read Chalmer's essay on the  [Hard and Easy problem](http://consc.net/papers/facing.html )?
There is no agency. A computer is a simple mechanism, and can be implemented using very different components:    * electronic (the kind you're using now)   * [mechanical](http://hackaday.com/2011/03/25/mechanical-turing-machine-can-compute-anything-slowly/ )   * [water and valves](http://www.inquisition.ca/en/info/artic/ordineau.htm )    When arranged in the right way, such parts can "compute" when a motor is run.  In the case of electronic computers, the motor is an electronic clock which causes the computer to advance from one step of a computation to another.  For a mechanical computer, a real motor does the job.    In fact, it doesn't matter what the parts are -- computers are said to be "equivalent" to each other --- i.e., any program you can describe in the most sophisticated modern electronic computer could be run (albeit slowly) on a mechanical or water-valve-based computer.    Think of a computer as a player piano which interprets a line of the piano roll differently depending on what keys are currently pressed, and which is capable of modifying the roll (adding or deleting holes) and moving it back and forth.  The only thing that is required is an external source of energy to drive it through its paces.  As I said above, in a modern computer, an electronic clock plays this role of stepping transistors through their paces, but the principle is the same.  The mathematician Alan Turing described the first general purpose computer, and that machine was capable of doing all of the computations of any modern day computer. Checkout the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40DkJ9vt5CI#t=13 ) in the "mechanical" link above.  Just pause and soak that in for a moment - that primitive device (given enough tape) is capable of doing any computation your fancy 2014 laptop is.  For that reason we call general purpose computers "Turing-complete".  They are all equivalent to each other in terms of the computations they can do. The only difference is that modern ones are smaller and faster, and have better input-output capabilities.  But  from a mathematical perspective, Turing's original "a-machine" was just as powerful.  In fact, the Turing machine in the video is capable of *simulating* the CPU in your laptop.  Pretty mind-blowing, huh?  Turing's machine was based on a pretty simple mechanism which had 6 states and wrote 2 symbols.  Yet, [even simpler mechanisms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfram%27s_2-state_3-symbol_Turing_machine ) have been described.  So Turing completeness is pretty easy to create.  People have even created Turing-complete computers inside virtual worlds [like Minecraft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X21HQphy6I ).   Given enough memory and time, they're just as capable as the most powerful super computer available today.  So how to computers appear to think and have agency?  All the magic happens in programs. Programs cause computing machines  to move from state to state and read and write symbols as it does so.  We interpret the output as the results of the computation.    I highly recommend Martin Davis's  excellent book on the origins of computing called ["The Universal Computer"](http://www.amazon.com/The-Universal-Computer-Leibniz-Turing/dp/0393047857 ) for a great explanation of how questions about the foundations of mathematics gave rise to modern computing.
Typical JPost garbage, perfectly illustrates pro-Israeli arguments:  ignore the main issue, the bombing of a densely packed open air prison filled with people whose homes have been stolen, and instead talk about lofty words in Israel's constitution.  This bit was particularly funny.   "Israel has never had laws that overtly discriminated between citizens on the basis of race."  There are more than 50 Israeli laws that discriminate against Palestinian citizens of Israel in all areas of life, including their rights to political participation, access to land, education, state budget resources, and criminal procedures. Some of the laws also violate the rights of Palestinians living in the 1967 OPT and Palestinian refugees.   http://adalah.org/eng/Israeli-Discriminatory-Law-Database

No, I agree that is pretty clearly biased.   Yet, a lot of this article rung true to me.  I think Clinton, if elected President, will be a disaster for progressives.  I've heard nothing out of her mouth that I believe.  Even when she talked about income inequality recently at the Aspen Ideas conference, it sounded like she was bullshitting.  She so carefully couched her words that it seemed like a nod and a wink to her fellow globalists: "just what the proles want to hear, don't you know".  That has been my impression, anyway.
