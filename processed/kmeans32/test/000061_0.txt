I'm not saying it tastes bad but when you have commercials on TV I think you're no longer a craft beer
Ha the comments "this is turning into Digg" and "this is looking more like metafilter"  Complaining about Reddit's downfall was there from the start
The problem is they look so forced. I think it would have been better if there were people doing stuff with bongs or whatever in the background. Like #5, is anyone comfortable looking at all in that pic?

Agreed. that is way more than a 40 lb difference. And looking like the left to the right in 4 months would be insane
Did some research. OP seems to post stuff in fantasy and writing subreddits. He's also the mod of r/shadestaff however it seems like a week old.  Looking up on Amazon the book came out about 6 months ago. Don't really have an opinion but these are the facts  Edit: I agree though that user has got to be an alt
Today, let my asshat be yourasshat :)
I am I will?
First saw her in the hallway of my gen Bio class and thought she was cute. A month later she was at my apt because she ended up bein a friend of a friend. Skip ahead like 5 months and I invited her to  a party I was having out of the blue and she came. We dated for 8 months after that
I'm from seattle area! If you like weird stuff check out Ye Olde curiosity shop in Seattle, it's right along the water. You're also within walking distance of pretty much the whole city, at least as far as touristy stuff goes. If you want to go hiking, the Cascade mountain range is about 40 minutes from Seattle so not too far
Thanks for your time. I'll be goin to the doctor soon
I live in a college town, 2 summers ago there was an entire block of houses on greek row that opened up their lawns to one big party. There was easily over 500 people there, the street was totally filled with people, the houses were crowded and beer pong in the lawns. I could hear it all the way from downtown which is like a mile away
I kinda think this is really dumb. For one he's 20 years older, he's wearing a hat and sunglasses, and they wouldn't be expecting him to just be there
I think not at all. For one, even with all the knowledge at my fingertips I hardly look it up. In fact I'm sitting in a library right now with enough books to easily become a heart and brain surgeon but I'm not reading them because I'm not motivated to on my own. School has structure, and teaches you how to learn things, and you can interact with others. And if you've ever taken an online class you know they're just not as enjoyable as the classroom setting
It is fun, by senior year though it all starts to sound the same. If you're a freshman though go and enjoy it!
I mostly agree with this. I'd also just say that any good music today isn't the catchy type of song that you would hear being sung in a bar
Easily one of the best episodes, not only because the acting is great but every character is engaged.  Ted wearing Tweed and becoming the sexless inkeeper and Barney's hilarious poem. Then Marshal with the gouda and Jason Segel's great singing video montage (meow). Then Barney and Robin being a "single" couple. "Just the 2 of you?" Lily getting upset with Marshal for springing the video and then getting in trouble for inviting the other couple for a weekend away too soon. And finally Ted'd own poem and Barney's look of regret at the end for being in a relationship " What have I done!"
"Who the hell is that guy?"  "That's Shin-Ya, he's sortof been auditing the class"
My friend said it great, in LoTR they made every single orc, the most copy pasteable thing imaginable, to look different and therefore awesome

I'm hardly an expert on this but I believe this is why you will suddenly get the urge to poop. Your internal sphincter will get a signal and relax enough for it to exit
That may be, but the people commenting =/= the people upvoting. Theres plenty of examples of thousands of upvotes, but the few hundred comments are all negative towards the image. Usually the comment section is people who truly care about the quality of pictures on here
You just sit on them and glide around the gym and of course smash into anyone in your path. Of course it ended in one of 2 ways: Your fingers going under the wheel or the thing tipping over also crushing your fingers.
Why is Robin so vehemently against dating Ted? Even when she's ready to settle down?   I know a big thing in their minds seems to be that "you're just not the one" but seriously. Especially when they are already like 35 years old and it seems to me like they have everything except that one spark that it takes.  They do end up going on more date in season 6 (?) and at the end Ted says it's just not going to work. I guess it always just seemed a bit forced that they don't get together
Well my one item would have to be the check the lottery people wrote me. Then go back in time say the 40's when I can actually use the check. Of course then my present lottery winnings are worth fortunes more. I then buy the US government, bang the First Lady of the time. Then I'd die fighting in Germany whistling a Charlie Parker tune
Oh you mean that girl over there showing half her ass? Yeah she's just with friends
That's how I got here. I remember back in 8th grade I had a Coach Z shirt. So awesome
I think it's stupid in most cases. Like at a bar when they pour a beer and hand it to me. I mean really what effort didd that take?  Now for a barber I'm all for it cuz they could totally ruin your life.

Well the lack of anything substantial in this picture would suggest /r/pics, and the content would suggest /r/mildlyinfuriating, but since this is so incredibly not funny it's gotta be /r/funny
