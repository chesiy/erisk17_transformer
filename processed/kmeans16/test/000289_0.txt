My local fish monger does a great job. Since  I'm not on the west coast I'm pretty sure that it was flash frozen at one point, but I'm not sure.
They're a tartare mixture, one with tuna the other with salmon. They have a little fish roe, Japanese mayo and some crunchy tempura bits. We would have added some scallions if we'd had any. The only reason they're not sitting on rice is because we ran out.

It's important to remember that bees are territorial and will attack other hives, killing the bees and stealing their honey if they are too close together.  Not everyone should have a bee hive, and in some regions you can go to a website to determine where the closest hive is to you.  It may not make sense to have one yourself. But for those people that have space for a hive, this looks interesting.
In Canada that would be $30,000.
My dad loves classic cars, and a '73 240z was the first car he ever bought with his own money. He bought another one in 2001 and let me drive it as much as I wanted.   It's like your ass is on the ground. I shit you not, you literally feel like you're sitting on the road. I used to take my girlfriend for a ride, and that car was like an aphrodisiac.   I wasn't alive when it was first  produced, but I'll always love that car.

Imagine how awesome this would be if all of the research into graphene pans out. The panels would be infinitely cheaper, more efficient, stronger and basically transparent.
I'm late to the conversation, but this is worth mentioning.   I was raised Catholic and went to church all my childhood, but after moving a couple of times I had pretty much stopped going to church by the time I became an adult and gradually lost a lot my beliefs over time.  Recently, my wife and I were planning to start attending church again since we now have a young daughter and we felt it was important that we raise her Catholic like we were. I went out and found a church for us.  At the new church I felt a connection with the deacon immediately. He was charismatic, energetic and "modern" for a church deacon.  He even baptized my daughter himself.  He was arrested on charges of distribution and PRODUCTION of child pornography mere months before she was enrolled in his Sunday school.  The thing that gets me the most is how comfortable I felt handing my child over that monster.  I'm done with the church now, not going back there or any other church.
Thanks for the reply!
Take her on The Hulk at Universal Studios. She will shit herself.

I travel for work constantly, I'm actually writing this in an airport. My best tip is to eliminate checked baggage. This won't help if you're going on vacation, but I can't tell you how many time this has saved me.   Tight connect? Your luggage doesn't get left behind.   Want to grab an earlier connecting flight? The first thing they'll ask is if you have checked luggage.   If you eliminate checked luggage, you can literally walk off the plane and to your car or hop into a cab without breaking stride.   This goes without saying, but the airline can't lose your luggage if its with you.   Note:  Please use only approved size luggage for carry on travel. If I see you on a flight with your whole life in multiple suitcases, I'll recline my seat into your lap as far as it can go.
