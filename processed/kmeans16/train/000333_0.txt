I'm more or less just summarizing what was on the front page of reddit in the aftermath of the FPH ban. I'm not stating whether the reasoning was sound or not, but rather WHY people felt that way. I mentioned /r/coontown because that was one of the frequently debated subs since many people consider it to be harassing, even though it didn't technically break any of Reddit's rules.
Possibly? I honestly don't know as the optical stack on a SP3 is so small. That being said, you can purchase desiccant on Amazon for not too much. Keep the Surface in an unsealed container completely covered in silica desiccant beads for several days and see if that removes moisture.. If you have the original box, the grey outer sleeve might work well.  Alternately, if you have a MS Store near you, you could try to replace the Surface there although it may be deemed user damage and not be covered under warranty.  Let me know how it turns out!
Why downvotes?! He actually has a "dickbutt" logo on his drill press if you look closely...
Bluetooth mouse.  Add the tracking setup beneath the camera, pop on a case with Teflon feet, open up the "mouse app", and you're good to go! Volume keys could be used as forward and back keys, and the screen could support multiple profiles with customizable buttons. You could even scroll and receive haptic feedback.
Unfortunately, I think its probably a loss. If it was a core component, those are all soldered to the motherboard, and it wouldn't be cost effective to replace. If it's just the screen, the laptop should still power up like it normally would.  Important questions... Where did you buy it and how long ago?  That would NOT be covered under the manufacturers warranty, BUT you may be able to get away with it since its not obvious how it happened. If you wanna be super shady, you could say that you went to use Skype or something and as soon as your camera turned on *POP*. As someone that used to make warranty decisions, that would seem somewhat feasible to me, although seeing it in person may be different.
If you're not concerned about installing programs, the original Surface RT with a keyboard is super durable, has like 9 hours battery life, and comes with Office installed. You can generally find them on sale for ~$150. If installing full function programs is required, I would follow everyone else's advise and grab a refurb of a deal website.  Also, check out dealnews.com daily. Its a great site that occasionally will find some killer deals on laptops (and more!)  Disclaimer: I work for Microsoft
What was your reason for not using the recovery partition on your laptop?   Depending on how you formatted/partitioned, you may be able to still use the factory recovery image. If you are trying to go from 8/8.1 to 8.1 Pro, you can type in "add features" on the Start screen and then follow the prompts to enter your 8.1 Pro key. It will upgrade without requiring a full re-install.  What brand is your laptop? Most laptop brands have different tricks to get into their recovery console.
There is rarely a single program that is universally good at protecting you, but if a nice "toolset" is assembled, it can greatly help. All of the listed programs are free!!  **[MSE or Microsoft Security Essentials:](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5201)** This is your base level protection that hopefully catches the really bad stuff. It get shit on a lot, but it seemingly offers great protection against some pretty nasty infections. It automatically updates with Windows and almost never bothers you gives pop-ups unless if finds something. *Note* : Don't install multiple, always-on, anti-virus programs and uninstall any old ones you don't use (Kaspersky, Norton, McAfee, etc). They can "fight" with each other stop working properly.  **[Malwarebytes](https://www.malwarebytes.org/mwb-download/):** This is a scanner that you have to run. Unlike MSE, it does not offer constant scanning (in the free version), but does a great job of removing both really nasty stuff as well as annoying toolbars and adware. Pro Tip: Right-click the check-boxes on the reports page, and click "Select All". Much easier than clicking every box!   **[ADWCleaner:](https://toolslib.net/downloads/finish/1/)** This is an easy to use and quick scanner that only targets adware, toolbars, browser hacks, etc. The app is portable (doesn't have to be installed) and is updated daily.  **[AdBlock Plus:](https://adblockplus.org/en/chrome)** This is an awesome little browser add-on that is an incredible pop-up blocker as well as helps get rid of banners and ads on websites. You'll have to install it on each browser you use separately; the link will auto-detect what browser you are using.  **[CCleaner](http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner/download/standard)**: Nice tool that cleans temp files (and can do a ton of other stuff if you're feeling bold). Doesn't really remove or scan for virus's, but malware very frequently hids in temp file locations. _____________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________  All that being said, if you really like subscription anti-virus (Kaspersky, McAfee, etc.) you can normally get them for**[ FREE!](http://dealnews.com/search.html?search=anti-virus)**
Saw them last night. They were good and chilled in the crowd for the rest of the acts.   Whoever was manning the audio board however was a total idiot. WAY too loud, woofers were distorting, and you could barely appreciate the music. I get that certain genres beg to be blasted, but this is not one of them.

This is true. Unfortunately there aren't any real engineering firms in my area and I definitely don't want to work here. I was going to interview one of my civ professors who used to be a practicing engineer, but thought a current engineer would give more prevalent answers.
Haha, thanks for the reply! It's really appreciated.
ohhh... okay then :)
SOO funny, I go to cuse an really wish I saw this
