Simply just think it is a beautiful movie. The cinematography is phenomenal as well as the acting. Also love how it is about everything, such as knowing your place in the world, how others view you, what an ego can do, and mostly love how it explains what is flawed about modern blockbusters and movie goers and how most Michael Bay type explosion extravaganzas are just pointless cash grab, but Birdman really is a piece of art in my opinion that I have been waiting a long time to see. Hopefully that answered your question!
Good Will Hunting.

Pulp Fiction.
"If this doesn't work out for you, you fuck off back to your studio palace and dive back into that cultural genocide you guys are perpetrating. You know, a douche bag is born every minute, that was P.T. Barnum's premise when he invented the circus, and nothing much has changed, and you guys know that if you crank out any toxic piece of crap, people will line up and pay to see it, but long after your gone, I'm gonna be on that stage, earning my living, bearing my soul, wrestling with real complex human emotions!" -Mike Shiner(Edward Norton), Birdman (or the unexpected virtue of ignorance)
I have not.
Solobek.
Birdman.
What two adjectives would make you cringe if describing food?
Respect the Assault jump party before minions spawn.   I am all about jump parties in smite where people jump up and down before minions spawn, it is just so fun and makes the game more fun. Nothing makes me more mad then when people are jumping and some asshole comes in gun's a blazing and initiates a fight, leading to betrayal and hatred. Please, respect the jump party...do not be THAT guy.
Corneal infection.
What is the funniest thing that obstructed a serious moment?
Yeah probably, I think the month December should just be called "Deck."
No, I'm an Anus Explorer. It's not very official, it's kind of a getting paid under the table type job, you know?
Requiem for a Dream.
What are some of your guys' favorite Breaking Bad tributes?
They DID mention a new one coming down the line soon enough. It may not make you feel awesome but who cares? For me I'm repping my favorite smite team and youngbae is my favorite Apollo player he got me to play Apollo again after I stopped. So I'm damn well buying the skin and you don't have to I just thing that it's just a nice little change up. You don't HAVE to like it. You also don't HAVE to get the skin.
Confirmed!
What movies from this time do you think will be considered "classics" in 50 years?
Nothing that may interest you. Cut really short on ps3 games ever since I sold it. Would you mind just coming to an agreement for just the collection? I apologize.
Classy response.
Okay thank you, man. For being understanding. I'll do it as soon as I can!
I can't send the pictures through the comment but I will post them on gameswap and just go to my account to see them. Sorry for the inconvenience.
I also have the newest one. Into the nexus. Is that okay if I do that?
Alright man I'll take into consideration what you said and I'll definitely apply it next time I play. Thanks a lot dude
Self confidence man, self confidence
Haha what was her reaction?
My mom has a new black boyfriend...   My parents are divorced and are still friends, my mom recently started dating a black man (my family is all whites), my dad was over looking for a key to a car. Keep in mind my dad has NEVER made a vulgar joke around me. While talking about the key to the car she says, "Yeah, it's big and black."  and so my dad says,  "Yeah, that's two things that are big and black." You can clearly see how butthurt my mom is.  Five minutes later he comes up to me and says "Daddy's clever, right?" and high fived me. I've never laughed so hard.
For my Computer Art class we could make any car of our choosing...
