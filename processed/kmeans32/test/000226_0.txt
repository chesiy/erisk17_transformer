This is a fascinating depiction of both the resilience of nature in the face of adversity and the significant long-term, unintended, and unexpected consequences of the oil spill.  The uncertainty of the science coming from the oil spill makes it more difficult to accurately portray the magnitude of the impact.  First-hand accounts like these, which cite experts who live and work among the impacted ecosystems, are a valuable resource.
The influence of infrastructure on human behavior is incredible.  Moreover, it's an important consideration in evaluating the long-term costs of any major infrastructure project.  While protected bike facilities may or may not be profitable at current usage rates, the resulting behavior change could decrease long-term costs by reducing wear and tear on roads and improving general health (through improved air quality and fitness and reduced accident fatalities).
It is amazing to see the breadth of impacts that climate change could have on the world.  Many of the worst harms will have implications for human health as ecosystems collapse, the incidence and severity of extreme weather events increases, and climatic patterns shift.  This panel follows the publication of the Pope's encyclical on the environment, another landmark report by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate change, and numerous recommendations and warnings from the US Environmental Protection Agency, all in the last year.  Momentum is building.
It will be interesting to see if the climate measures enacted by BP and Shell will have any significant effect on company behavior.  If so, to what extent will changes in supply-side behavior effect greenhouse gas emission levels?  This article states that "Chevron, Exxon, and BP are among the 90 companies that have contributed two-thirds of the greenhouse gas emissions that have caused the climate change of the 21st century."
While no specific weather event can be tied directly to climate change, severe weather events are increasing in frequency and magnitude.  In the Northeast, recent winters have been unusually cold and snowy compared to historic averages.  Tying these changes to rapid Arctic ice loss is interesting.

Many ecologists use birds as an indicator species for overall ecosystem health.  If our birds are in trouble, ecosystems likely are as well, and ecosystem approaches (like the wetland restoration programs the article mentions) may lead to more success stories down the road.
