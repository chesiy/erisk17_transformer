How old are you?
I smell butthurt.
So?
If you want serious answers, include [SERIOUS] in the title.
Look pal, I'm not going to look up everything for you but here you go:    http://m.dailykos.com/story/2015/06/01/1389699/-BERNIE-COURIC-Interview-Bernie-is-voting-against-USA-FREEDOM-ACT  Sanders, who opposed the Patriot Act and its reauthorization, said he plans to **vote against** the less-wide-ranging USA Freedom Act, passed last month by the House, which would allow some counterterrorism tools  including the NSAs controversial bulk data collection  to remain in place.    And just in case you don't know exactly what the USA Freedom Act really is:  http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Freedom_Act
Where did you hear that?
I made this months ago, am going through a tough time at the moment, it makes me laugh, maybe you too.
Thank you!
BOOO CAPTIONS!
Kevin, here is a comment you made about the Ferguson protestors (I'll hyperlink it so you can click it and be taken to the source):  [Ferguson riots have very little to do with the shooting of the young man. It is an excuse to be the losers these animals truly are. **It is a tipping point to frustration built up over years of not trying, but blaming everyone else, The Man, for their failures.** It's always someone else's fault when you give up. Hopefully this is a reminder to the African Americans \( I always thought we just Americans. Oh, well.\) that their President [they] voted in has only made things worse for them, not better.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/21/kevin-sorbo-ferguson-animals-losers_n_5697647.html)  My questions is as follows:    In regards to the selection I have bolded: Do you really believe that African Americans are not at a disadvantage in our (American) society? Enslaved for hundreds of years, [falsely reported as inferior by pseudo-scientific studies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_racism#United_States:_slavery_justified), segregated after emancipation, subjected to [institutional racism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_racism#United_States) (especially in Ferguson, MO as cited by a [DOJ report](http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/press-releases/attachments/2015/03/04/ferguson_police_department_report.pdf)), constantly bashed by conservative media, etc. After all of the history and examples I have linked, do you still believe they are simply "not trying"?
We're only hearing OP's side of the story.  Anyway, I must be lost because /r/pettyrevenge doesn't seem like the place to question the revenge that took place. It's more of a "yeah fuck that person" bandwagon.
Thankfully, yes. I was a sophomore in high school at the time. I graduated, went to college, and now have a stable job and a semi-stable life. A ton better than what it used to be.   Gosh, it doesn't feel that long ago. It's been more than six years. Woah. Time flies.
[Build Help] HDD just crashed, can't locate my Windows 7 install. Where can I get a copy for the least amount of money?   I don't understand why Windows 7 and 8.1 are the same price. The only thing I can think of is that they are trying their best to phase-out Windows 7.   For how old Windows 7 is, I don't think $100 is a reasonable price so I'm looking to you all for help with this matter. Maybe you know of a not-so-common software shop that has copies or maybe you know about decent sales going on around the internet.   Your help is greatly appreciated.
Could you recommend a brand of carbless sweetener?
Fhrer of Comcast here! AMA!
It sucks it always comes off dickish.   I just wanted to help out, he could be a non-native speaker.
I'm not sure why you and I are being downvoted...
HEY FUCK YOU PAL.   ;)
It's a species of worm that feeds on the plant. It is just a worm, not a hallucinogen.   There is a dish served in that area that is a bunch of the worms fried up. I've had it, it's pretty good!
I don't know how to say this nicely:  Too bad. :D
Here is the recipe!    http://cavemanketo.com/crispy-wings/    If you're trying to cut back on fat, then baking would be best.  I'm on the keto diet so I'm just trying to limit my carb intake and let me tell you, I fry chicken thighs this way and I can't believe how crispy they turn out!
"Blue" "Waffle"

Thanks! I overclocked it to 4.1Ghz but mulitplayer hasn't changed much. I think the highest I can clock it is 4.2, I might try that!

[REQUEST][STEAM] Civ 5: Brave New World DLC   http://steamcommunity.com/id/jrockbarn  You know how it went on sale 2 days ago? Well this whole damn time I've owned the game I have just assumed I've had it. Until last night.  I play mulitplayer with some friends of mine and I try and join their game only to find out I don't actually have it and now it's $30 (a little ridiculous for a DLC if you ask me). If you have an extra copy from a bundle, i'd appreciate it.  I'll even draw something in mspaint for you if you comment (you don't have to give me the game for me to draw.)
I need help finding a parody titled "how 3 runescape"or something similar.   It was posted a couple of days ago, maybe thursday/friday of last week. It had horn sounds at the end of the runescape theme song. I've googled, searched reddit, searched my youtube history with no luck.  Any help would be appreciated. It was hilarious.
Multiple-dial lock troubles.   At work we have [wall-mounted lock box](http://imgur.com/UEUElTj) where we store keys. It's always been open but yesterday I bumped up against it and closed it. Now it's locked shut and nobody knows the combination.  It's not your typical [multiple-dial lock](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Combination_discs.png), I've looked up youtube guides that tell people to look for markings under the turning dials and it doesn't have that. What I do see is [THIS](http://imgur.com/m3MtVjw). There is a flat surface on the cylinder below all three of the dials. I've tried lining them up facing me with no luck, I tried using the opposite number as well with no luck. I'm not even sure if that's the way I should be going in order to open it.  I need help opening this lock. Any help would be appreciated.
Spoilers: Why we sh-should wait to post content from recent episodes, Morty *belch*.   "BECAUSE IT'S COMMON C-C-COURTESY.   Think about it, Morty. You're have school on Friday *buurp* so you can't go see the midnight premier of C-Captain America: The Whatever. So you're talking to your friends when one goes:  'Hey Morty!, I saw Captain America: The Winter Soilder last night, here is some pictures of it even though you haven't seen it yet because you're following your capitalist overlords' wishes by being a slave to education and you're a good boy because of social pressures.'  H-h-how would you feel, MORTY? Would you feel angry!? *Beeeeeelllcccchhh* Yeah, that's what I thought. Think about, it Morty."    I get it, it's a karma gravy-train. But some of us have to be up for work early in the morning, have early classes, or don't have cable and have to wait for the episodes to be available online. So here we are browsing and BAM, a spoiler appears. It doesn't feel to good.
Can someone explain Bailey Jay to me?   Am I correct in saying that she was once a man? I know that's probably a dumb question. She just looks so much like a woman! Except with a dick. Anyhow, I saw this presentation on shemales and how men get turned on by them. But gay men aren't. It's weird how our brains work. Something called an erotic illusion. Here's the talk: http://youtu.be/p-A8GvUehq4?t=21m35s.
Just had this interesting revelation last night.
