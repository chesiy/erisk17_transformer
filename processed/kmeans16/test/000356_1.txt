Yeah I meant it as a good thing for sure ! I'm imaging a total mimic of it and I think it'll be great !
wow thats awesome. well I'm defiantly getting it now. Thanks for the kind helpful responses
do not tell me how i feel. I'm not going on a 'self-pitying rant' i thought this subbreddit was called ofmychest. i thought i was allowed to come and get something off my chest not be judged or be told what to do by you.
Yes it probably does and i get that, but surely with his past he must find a way of mainting a bit of professionalism, I think it speaks volumes about his character that he petulantly gets up and walks out. or am i the only one who thinks he should act more professionally. or because he's a star who can afford to walk of stuff he hates doing that makes it okay ?
yep
i have no problem with pics or anything like that i love most of the content on here ! I'm just saying I'm not okay with the self-promotion 'heres my series give it a like and subscribe' and all that jazz, thats not good content its cheap is what it is. all i see here half the time is fucking 'work the space' videos, i mean jesus christ
firstly i love cheesy comedy one of the reasons i love pierce brosnan as bond was because of the lines e.g i thought christmas only comes once a year. but i just like kevin bacon and stupid cheesy crap jokes
That's weird
currently the one at the moment I'm in 2032 with arsenal, my best save so far i'm an arsenal fan so its been fun. highlights of the save Brendan Rogers  has been England manager since 2014 winning a world cup and bringing England to 3rd in the rankings, Frank Lampard is a very successful manager and liverpool got relegated in 2016 and have been in lower-midtable ever since
i don't need to justify myself to some over-opinionated asshole. I'm up for a discussion and debate but like this subreddit its not possible without running into know it all wankers like you.  you are a cunt mate and most of your posts have downvotes so most people must think the same. peace
jesus !
Mate thats quite a story keep me informed !
Nice ! keep me updated :)
its going better on my arsenal save. i stormed the league in my first season and won the champions league (probably my proudest achievement) beating man united in the semis. however my second season was disaster made some wrong moves in the transfer window and ended up finishing 9th  i got to the semis of the champions league the league cup and the fa cup all knocked out by man united ( I'm glad the old rivalry is back though)  i somehow managed to keep my job and most of my important players. now I'm in my third season and I'm two points of top but I'm just targeting a top 4 finish.i have also had a lot of fun bringing my youth through dan crowley serge gnabry and a few others are now semi regulars. but yeah thats it at the moment
haha thats awsome !
thanks for the advice and the help means a lot thanks again :)
