I could have sworn that Obama said there would be no grounds troops in Iraq.  Oh, that's right, he did:  [To The Troops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ5lm_H0NcY)  [To The Press](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu9YqE3QZzc)  [To The American People](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3ME9sVjwQ4)  [From The White House](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv8Gu3jmibQ)  [Before Boarding The Presidential Helicopter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsGV5oFfnZc)
The President's decision to send 300 advisers to Iraq is a good first step, but their ability to deter ISIS will be limited unless we eventually engage in airstrikes to target their leaders as well as the supply lines that they use to transfer weapons and fighters between Syria and Iraq.  I wonder who wrote this garbage for him?
Yemen has become among the least permissive environments for U.S. officials in recent years. American military and intelligence personnel have played a crucial role in counter terrorism efforts in Yemen, regularly striking suspected militants with drones, and providing support to the countrys fledgling security forces.
It is no worse than what other countries have done in the past/are doing now.  For the last 50 to 60 years, the US govt is by far the [most violent and deadly force on the planet earth](http://www.alternet.org/investigations/executive-branch-evil-and-lawless).  Your statement is simply incorrect.
Great comment.  Thanks.

USA! USA! USA!
if you want an endless war, sure, let's keep afghanistan in a perpetual state of domestic conflict and completely ignore the eerily similar events of history.  Intervention by foreign powers has caused all of the problems you're referring to.  What Afghans do in their own country is not now, nor has it ever been, the business of the United States.  You have to understand that you have been brainwashed by your employer with these phony arguments in order to get you to kill people who have never posed any threat to you or your country.  I'm sorry your life will be perpetually scarred by the immoral acts you participated in while serving the interests of some politicians and the arms manufacturers.
Rand Paul wing  Seriously? When did Rand Paul get his own wing of the GOP?  Obviously the activists protesting the rule change are left over from the Ron Paul campaign and probably have nothing to do w/ Rand.  Nice "reporting."
The use of armed drones is likely to accelerate as most of the 66,000 U.S. troops in the country are due to withdraw by the end of 2014. **The remotely piloted long-range aircraft, which kill targets with virtually no risk to American lives, carry an unmistakable attraction for military commanders.**
"Well sadly, I think I'd rather open a business in [the United Kingdom] than the U.S.," he says. "The U.S. isit's a minefield. Open a business in California? You must be joking. The lawyers, the taxespeople talk about high taxes here. Well, yes they are high, but in America, in the places you might really want to open a businessNew York, L.A.you've got state taxes, city taxes, state income taxes, city income taxesyou add that lot up, you're paying more over there than here."
You've "accomplished" nothing other than destroying millions of lives.  If it helps your psychological balance to think that you have, then so be it.  Every man I killed, if given the opportunity to come to America, would have comitted acts far worse than the tragedy in Connecticut.  And you're calling me ignorant?  You're just spouting a warmonger talking points.  Yeah, you killed those people so women could learn to read.  If you really believe that bullshit, then you probably still believe in the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy.  Jesus, grow up.
Here's the headline and story.  You be the judge: [Romney Says Remarks on Voters Help Clarify Position - Mr. Romney said he stands by comments that he said demonstrates his belief in the power of free enterprise rather than a growing reliance on largess from the federal treasury.](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/19/us/politics/in-leaked-video-romney-says-middle-east-peace-process-likely-to-remain-unsolved-problem.html?_r=0)
The reason for the silence about such matters, and the reason commentary of this sort sparks such anger and hostility, is two-fold: first, the US likes to think of terror as something only "others" engage in, not itself, and more so; second, supporters of Barack Obama, the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, simply do not want to think about him as someone who orders attacks on those rescuing his victims or funeral attendees gathered to mourn them.  That, however, is precisely what he is, as this mountain of evidence conclusively establishes.
The military has not tortured anyone legally, you are thinking about the CIA.  So, I guess you're saying the CIA is and has always been running Bagram Prison, Gitmo and Abu Ghraib where torture was routine? And, I don't think it was the CIA who tortured the Afghan taxi driver to death in the documentary *[Taxi To The Dark Side](http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/taxi-to-the-dark-side/)*.  President Roosevelt ordered the bombing of Japan  Actually, it was Truman, not the deceased Roosevelt, who ordered the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Japan (who was far from defeated).  Then I guess you [disagree with Gen. Eisenhower](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower) who said about Truman's decision to drop the bombs:  "I was against it on two counts. **First, the Japanese were ready to surrender**, and it wasn't necessary to hit them with that awful thing. Second, I hated to see our country be the first to use such a weapon."  [Admiral Leahy](http://www.doug-long.com/quotes.htm): "It is my opinion that the use of this barbarous weapon at Hiroshima and Nagasaki was of no material assistance in our war against Japan. **The Japanese were already defeated** and ready to surrender because of the effective sea blockade and the successful bombing with conventional weapons."  [Gen. MacArthur](http://www.doug-long.com/quotes.htm): [MacArthur] replied that he saw **no military justification for the dropping of the bomb**. The war might have ended weeks earlier, he said, if the United States had agreed, as it later did anyway, to the retention of the institution of the emperor."  hatred of the military  I hate pointless mass killing and destruction.  Unfortunately, the U.S. military is an eager participant in both of these activities.  The U.S. military does not protect freedom, it endangers it. If I'm wrong, tell me how I am more free today than I was prior to 9/11 or the Iraq War.
Sorry, but the U.S. military does what most people would consider "abhorrent" things every day.  You routinely attack countries who do not threaten America nor ever could, you've killed literally millions of people in unnecessary foreign conflicts around the globe, you have tortured and continue to torture helpless individuals at secret prisons at the behest of the President, and, to top that off, you dropped city-destroying nuclear bombs on a nation that was already defeated in WWII.  Look at your real history, not the fanciful mythology you've been brainwashed with, and my guess is that a military acting on its own won't seem like such a far-fetched idea.
Best analysis so far from the Christian Science Monitor: **[Why Ron Paul's 2012 effort may not really be over](http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/DC-Decoder/Decoder-Wire/2012/0514/Why-Ron-Paul-s-2012-effort-may-not-really-be-over)** - The Ron Paul campaign won't run ads in upcoming primaries, but Paul is still out to make his mark at the GOP's August convention. That means getting supporters elected as delegates and even picking up some 'stealth' delegates.
**Sometimes you have to take life to save lives**, and thats what weve been able to do to prevent these individual terrorists from carrying out their murderous attacks.
According to three Afghan security officials familiar with the case, the main suspect was Abdul Saboor, who was said to have worked in the ministry for more than a year as a driver. The two American officers who were killed were shot in the head and the pistol used to kill them was **equipped with a silencer**, the officials said.  Afghan officials said that Mr. Saboor was at large, apparently **able to leave the ministry without complication after the shooting**. That suggested to some observers that he may have had help in the attack.

And he said he did not understand how U.S. President Barack Obama is able to characterize Iraq as a free, stable and democratic country.   "What sort of Iraq we are talking about?" he asked. "How the Americans will feel proud? How the American administration is going to justify to the taxpayer the billion of dollars that has been spent and at the end of the day the American saying, 'Sorry, we have no leverage even to put things in order in Iraq'?"
I hate to post this crap, but it's out there and everyone should be aware of it.
Disclosure foes argue that the need for secrecy is unquestioned in conventional wars. In World War II, they were killing people all over the place, with lots and lots of mis-hits, one official said. The civil liberties community wasnt saying we want to see targeting lists of what youre hitting. **George Washington did not turn over his targeting list of the British**.
