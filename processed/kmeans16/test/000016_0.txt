[META] Is there any video/gif in this sub you didn't had the guts to see? Post it here!   I personally can't stand videos where children is harmed or killed.

We know very little about the universe. I mean, we do know a thing or two but, in scale, the universe is an unknown for us. So, my theory is that: if a **''never-seen-before infinite amount of energy''** strikes Earth in a fraction of second, destroying everything that we know, we all would be dead so fast that none of us would feel it coming. And this can happen at any time! The universe is infinite, so no one can prove that a disaster like this can't happen. It just freaks me out thinking that we could die at **ANY** moment due to a unknown space event of enormous strenght...
That's definitely a disturbing story, I had never read one that involved something changing it's color.   Nice site though!
X room mod! It's a very unknown channel of a guy who performs paranormal rituals found in internet.  EDIT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_g2lnvouQw feature=youtube_gdata_player
Wow!! That's an amazing experience/writing. In my country, the use of hallucinogenic mushrooms is a very discussed (and studied) thing: the presence of trusted people alongside you, during the trip, is very important indeed to the trip travel safer roads.  One question: do you remember the species (and the dosage that you guys used that night) of those shrooms? It is a valuable information, cause the totality of the trip fully depends of those partcular factors.  Again, nice experience, bro. Would have gilded if i had gold jajajajaja.
