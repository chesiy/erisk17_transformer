Shutup Davey Dave!!
I took a photo of my cousin's Dog the other day...
He looks like Ted Bundy
This happens so often
I have been feeling like this a lot recently and it is freaking me out! It also sometimes makes me feel like I don't actually have depression for some reason
That's the same with me too :/
why?
SHIT how old were you??
that's not intentional murder though, just an unfortunate accident
no
apparently the average person walks past 6 murderers in their lifetime, I reckon I have met one before but it is still unlikely that i did
I went there in the summer - it is one of the most beautiful places I have ever been to!
I have this, I come across as so insanely ditsy that people misjudge me for being stupid or simple-minded
I absolutely love this painting - is it done on MS paint??/digitally????
Same :) it makes me want to watch it:)
Exactly how i'm beginning to feel
When I was younger I felt like I knew what it was like to be stabbed or disembowelled almost like that had happened in a past life. weird.
It is always ok to see a therapist
My cousin's cousin goes to this school!
I want a 3D pen so badly!
The creepy little guy inside still freaks me out today
OMG SAME I WAS TERRIFIED OF THIS HOUSE!
same
You should post this to r/creepy
I wish people would stop calling these people 'Midget's' Its so insanely rude!
Is this place in France? Because I have heard real-life stories about that mansion
I am not a lying camera whore.
I didn't put lotion on that part of my body and washed my hands thoroughly straight afterwards
I know right! nobody touched my shoulder that day though!
They have such a creepy vibe - I saw the girl on the right kind of

A hand-print appeared on my shoulder after a sun-tan - I can't think of any logical explanations for this - no editing or effects
