I love the movie "Her". I think Scarlett was perfect for that role. Her voice is just so captivating to me.
Thank you! I appreciate it!

I digitally painted Glenn, as a study!
I'm rewatching TWD(just finished S4E02). Decided to take this chance to read the old discussion thread and came across an interesting comment.
Thank you for this. I've been trying to motivate myself to get into shape, but I'm not sure what I should do first. Like, what do I eat? Will I even have time to prepare meals, everyday? If I go to the gym ,how do I know, no one's going to take photos of me and post them on some place like reddit, to mock me? I see that happening a lot. It really terrifies me :/  It causes me so much anxiety.
Oh my goodness. I'm so, so sorry you had to go through that. Thank you for the heads up. I hope you're living in a much better place, now! Take care!
Also, is that area LGBT friendly?
I digitally painted Darth Maul!
Thank you! I honestly never done any other shows, but I certainly can! I was really inspired to paint something from this show because I absolutely love the style of the show; the colors and cinematography! It' a really gorgeous show!
Thank you, so much!
I don't plan on selling this particular piece, only because I want to avoid legal trouble, but I do have other pieces of art for sale here:http://society6.com/cassy_dale  Thank you so much for your interest!
Did religions other than Christianity inspire art forms like the Catholic Church did with baroque art, pre 19th century?
I always feel a bit weird telling people about how bears are my favorite animals. Shortly after, I have to explain to them that it's in no way a sexual reason. Yeah... Grizzly Bears are my favorite. I even like the bad, too, haha!
Man, I really dislike all of the hate Claire is getting, this season, too. I really don't think it's hard for people to change, like Claire has been doing. She was ruthless the first two seasons, but not a psychopath like Frank. Which is why I think the writers has been showing more of her humanity, this season, despite how many mishaps she's been having. People make mistakes. I don't think she  has what it took to be an ambassador( which was clear, throughout the season) and she obviously knew that. All the pressure just got to her, you know? If any of you were in her situation, the same would happen to you.  Besides, I think it's incredibly bad writing to just have the main characters come out on top, all of the time. That gets boring. A great example of this is the character Superman. He's completely overpowered. Yes, he has kryptonite to slow him down, but he's a very boring character because he's practically unstoppable. So, I think it's great that Claire and Francis hasn't been succeeding, this entire season. Otherwise it would just get predictable.
Oh my gosh. I did not know that was a thing. Thank you!!
