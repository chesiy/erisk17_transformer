The Revenant (for me) is a must watch  Sicario. Denis Villenueve's new film. Along with Deakins shooting, you can't go wrong.  Star Wars. Duh.  Hateful Eight. Tarantino's new movie gotta see it.   Steve Jobs. Bound to win some oscars.  Spectre. Skyfall was fucking spectacular, hope this tops it.  Ant-Man. I'll give it a shot.  Southpaw. Love Jake Gyllenhaal.  MI5: Rogue Nation. Looks awesome, loved the 4th one.  I've probably missed heaps but those are my main ones.
What is that from? Please tell.
All good, thank you anyway!
As you can all see I am no writer. Within the DCCU, we have Batman v Superman, Suicide Squad and Justice League Parts 1   2 all staring Ben Affleck as Batman. DC have also announced that they are making a single stand alone Batman film JUST about Batman (obviously there will be supporting characters within) whereas Suicide Squad, Justice League and BvS are all feature Affleck's Batman as a supporting character.  In this discussion I just wanted to ask everyone what they would like to see in this stand alone Batman film, what villains they would like to see etc.

Fight Club [1999]
Mad Max: Fury Road with a smashing 98% on Rotten Tomatoes and a 9/10 on IMBD. Is anyone beyond pleasantly surprised by how many good reviews this is getting?
Can you guess [this](http://imgur.com/4RQNtH0) one? Good luck
Compared to a PURE fascist regime, how fascist was Nazi Germany?   Please provide examples as well. Thanks! (I'm new here)
Fuckin A
Maybe I'm over-reacting a bit, and I normally take documentaries with a grain of sand, but this just really got to me. I just cannot believe what these bastards have gotten away with and how they treat their people. How they practically used people, such as Tom Cruise, to gain power and superiority. Also, how they basically destroyed his marriage to Nicole Kidman. Don't even get me started on that bastard Miscavige....  Like I said, how true can all this be? It seems pretty legit to me. I just wanted to see if anyone else feels the same way :)

His upcoming film the revenant, may just be it. I don't see any oscar caliber perfomances in the months to come, but what can I say? I haven't seen all the films this year but the only oscar territory perfomances I can see coming up so far are Michael Fassbender as Steve Jobs and Leo as Hugh Glass in 'The Revenant' (did you see the image they release of him!? JESUS he looks intense)
I don't see why you were downvoted for that, you made a very solid point. Upvoted :)
Ah.
