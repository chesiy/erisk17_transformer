FUCKING YES. This.
Ha, yeah, my cat's name is Hercules and [he is a big 14 pound tabby](http://i.imgur.com/NFLCtgc.jpg). Sweet as can be, though!
Burrowing owls and barn owls? :)
Thank you so much! I hope to contribute more! :)
This is amazing! Arya's my homework and Song of the Sea is such a beautiful movie, too.
Reason A is directly linked to reason B...So, yes. If I didn't live with both of them, I'd be fine with visits and hearing the resulting porkfest. I just don't want to live with a couple; even if they're my friends.
It's hard to put my finger on it. I think mostly it feels like I'm hearing my brother and sister fucking each other if that makes sense. Beyond that, I just have never really liked the idea of living with a couple. Especially new couples. No matter how well we get along and how well we know each other,  it's still a new relationship and things could change for the worse.    nbsp;   Also, to be completely honest, I've never felt as comfortable hanging out with the guy alone without her there to facilitate the conversation so, meh.
Touching fire
Thank you! These are all very helpful! I do have experience painting digitally but it's mostly cartoon stuff. I'm not very confident about making money with my art, sadly. You can check some of it out at http://faunus-crypticus.tumblr.com if you're curious, though!
Oh wow this is a great one :)
I'm so sorry to hear about your friend and his nephew! I can't help with money becaus I, too am in a rut but i'm happy to write a letter to the family with my sympathies, though! I hope you're okay, too- I'm sorry you're all going through this :(
Thank you! Is there anything I can make for you???
I can give you the bird; that one I still have! I stupidly cleaned off the spilling because I was being hard on myself and ended up making it have an orange background.. You are welcome to have it anyway, though. Other than that I can make you a cat if you'd prefer! I gifted the fat cat to an old room mate for holding onto a sentimental piece of furniture that I sold years back but I love drawing cats and am always happy to do more :)
I don't even know how to ask for it. I made this at 4am. I guess the most important thing I honestly need is cat food and cat litter right now. I'm more worried about taking care of him than myself. I still have some ramen packets I can get by on for a bit. Gosh I'm embarrassed.
Oh my god!!! I love this, haha. He looks so beaten down by life.   *"I don't know, man... I've... I've seen some shit."*   Thank you so much!
[Offer] Need to make a little extra dough to pay for bills. I can draw animals/monsters/nature themed stuff! Pay whatever you think my art is worth :)   http://faunus-crypticus.tumblr.com    References can be seen on my tumblr. I can do digital or traditional media. Sorry if this breaks any rules, I just figured it's worth a shot.
Wow, you have such an amazing body! I'm envious! :)
Thank you! :)

1: nope! I work at a bar that's underground so no one will wanna go. We are clooooosed :)   2: only in my bedroom so I've been a hermit lately, haha...   3: ummm... I've been fond of rye manhattans for a while now. I also really like most gin drinks. Tom Collins are my jam and pimm's cup :)
OH GOD WHAT DID I MISS?
Clownfish can change their gender
This is in Boston. Everything is expensive and nothing makes sense.
Thank you so much! This is incredibly helpful! I've tried quite a few, but honestly ony can remember about one or two from most categories as I wasn't drinking them with the intention of selling it, heh. I really appreciate the feedback and will keep it in mind until I have my own go-to's as ammunition :)
A murmuration of starlings, actually! :)
Great job!
This comes off more creepy and stalkerish than awesome. I feel bad for celebrities sometimes. Cool photo either way, OP. Workaholics is great... Maybe next time take a mental picture when you're in a situation like that?
Haha no offense taken. I was greasy and awkward... It was also taken in a shitty mall photo booth with my best friend at the time... It had a banner that said **ANGEL'S** or something pathetic like that, too. I'd probably be offended if I still looked like that, haha...
My really pretty what?
Foggy, clear Converse. That sounds awful!
