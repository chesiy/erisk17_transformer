I wanna write you too! Never done that before. I'd imagine it'd give you a way to pass the time. Good luck dude.
No
Seems like you need an adventure. This is the perfect time to travel or take an internship away from home. CC is going to cost a lot in Cali, but I'm not sure about other states on the west coast. Go on a road trip, volunteer, wwoof, workaway, do something. I'm moving coasts next year!
I'd ask what he was thinking and how he felt. Then go from there. I can't really say I'd dump him straight away, because its based on his reasoning. Having said that, I hope this never happens. Or, maybe I do. I don't know, I'm a lost 21 year old. Love me.
Yeah they're from my hometown and making headway across the US. Theyre one of those bands that are respected no matter if the person likes their music or not.  They told me theyd do another AMA here once their album comes out.
Be prepared to out in more effort and work. Do participate in class, ask questions. One if the biggest things I regret was doing this and not going to a professors office hours to form a relationship. Definitely will help down the line with recommendations, plus networking is always a necessity.   Oh, and as much as grades DO matter, if you pass you're okay and no one will care.
Where's Picasso's?
Not him but I am!

I just wrote this long response but it got deleted. Basically, yes it does take a while to build up but for me, its different than cymbalta or something. I can tell which days I do or don't take it, and recognize its effects. Other than Xanax, there is a very popular pill (I think a benzo) that is nonaddictive and often prescribed because of this. I can t remember its name off the top of my head but you can search for it and do your own research. Allergy pills can affect your brain like Xanax, so it could be used as a quick fix.
Yeah I love that they care and ask me if i need I talk but the only people that understand are people that have gone through it or are currently struggling. Everyone knows my dirty laundry, but not it's extent.  Giving you advice would be hypocritical fit me because I'm stuck in this cycle as well. I don't care about anything including myself and gave up on getting better. You need someone, done meds, and to push yourself to make memories and do things.   Also, having a drink is fine, everyone gets through the day in their own way, but it's a depressant. Alcohol makes me want to kill myself and everyone I know that has depression (not many open people) feels worse when drinking. Just food for thought. Msg me if you'd like to talk.
Witness protection?
Nice. I'm going to be moving from the east to west coast next year. Idk. I believe you should take chances and do whatever makes you happy. I think a lot of people say that but don't act on it...
Did it.
My desk
I think you're a cop.
I feel the same. So I don't put up a picture. Id say post something where you're dressed decently, at some kind of party, and crop out anything bad. Or get a plain room with a dress shirt and take a photo with a timer.
I have the same degree, graduated in May. I've gotten offered sales and marketing jobs but fuck the man. I have business and refuse to contribute to the overwhelming consumerism. I don't care at this point. I'm secure at home for now and will wait until I find a good job. I don't overly care/worry about work, I care about life.  Oh, and I remember reading an article that was on the top 10 companies that hire new college grads. Google that! You're going to have to pay your dues if you want to work in HR, I think.
What do you do for money? Do you need money? What is the average income? Are prices higher due to seclusion? Do you like it? Is it beautiful? How can I become a resident?
Honestly, if you like her is suggest waiting until dating. Things might get funny with sex, it happened to me.  Trim up decently. Make sure you're clean. Then start kissing her. Eventually feel and caress her then fuck her. Also, if you get off quick and then button up, you will be a dick if she got no enjoyment out of it. If you care about her, you'd get her off too.  I despise guys that leave after they cum after 2 minutes. Nothing more disrespectful.
I haven't worked in a market but have worked at a place that does samples. The worst is people that just want something free and pick it up and keep walking. Or anyone that seems as if they're definitely not going to buy anything. If you take a sample, expect to stay for 30 seconds and let me tell you about the product. If you want to try all of them because you want to try something new and potentially buy, I have no problems with you.

ask your neighbor. if he hassles, tell him you'll buy him mcdonalds. Or craigslist. Or call the local news for help. Or a radio station. Or yik yak. Or be like the girl from that one college that said she would carry around a mattress until her rapist got expelled, which then led to multiple people carrying the mattress FOR her for weeks.
Woohoo! I miss those early days, like my first 5 times having sex. Lots of nostalgia for that point in my life. I had sex last week and it felt like a daily routine, like brushing my teeth. *sigh*  Watching the walking dead tonight?

I thought that too and considered eating it again. I don't think that's why I'm depressed though, although diet is probably one of my main problems. I bet this is more of a humorous post, but if anyone has articles on depression and meat/non meat eaters, send them my way.
Not sure what that means..
So much always happens in an episode, I feel I have to comment while watching the episode to actually convey everything I want to say... But that's not going to happen.  Love Lip's stuff still, I really don't think they're going to get him caught in some way like the others... Unless this is the last season - interesting way to end the show for good is if they put everyone in jail or suicide. I think it's becoming more clear that his storyline will be to enter the professional world and succeed, even if his luck pisses viewers off  Definitely want to kill Sammi. At the same time, I thought she was going to kill herself after she told Ian he was great and going to be okay. Her, Ian, and Charlie could all be in the running for a suicide ending, hopefully not. I think there's going to be a crazy season finale of a very smart death brought upon by Mickey and Fiona, maybe the rest of the Gallagher squad as well.... BUT at the same time, like Lip said last episode, Carl going to jail was inevitable at some point, and Ian getting caught is as well. It was something they were responsible for, Sammi just bridged the gaps I guess.  Don't get Debbie pregnant. Don't. Urghh. Still, I do like the relationship and don't think having sex was wrong for her. Yes, she'd still young, but at least it's in a caring, healthy relationship, plus they seem to be best friends which is most important (i think) during teen sex.  Fucking Fiona, okay, the kiss was in a specific context but just... be a prude for an episode or something.  Hate commenting on Frank but he's so in love, even if it's a friend kinda love. This makes me upset, but happy at the same time. I think the doctor dies at the end of the season, showing that Frank can experience heartbreak and sadness -- I don't think she'll be cured or they'll call her with a fake positive or anything like that.
Well, I don't know really. I think that's you're part, you have to get creative. Services don't really require much capital versus producing goods. Haven't you ever heard of the red paperclip trade? Maybe get certified in a trade, like software, design, etc and begin in that way. Good luck. I really say this because I fee the same way and really don't think working for someone is right for me and can't seem to find a company and position that I will work well with. I want to live my life combining all the things I love and be my own leader, I don't know how far working for a company will take me as far as natural fulfillment. I plan on (hopefully) opening my own food business, then expanding to greater things.  Where do you live? I could use a partner...
Grab generic food from aldis or save a lot of something like that. Maybe a bag of chips for every 2 people. Cook something, like a homemade dip or brownies. Invite people to bring something if they'd like or plan on making smores in the microwave or something silly... like a taco party, or a nacho party.  games like cards against humanity, charades, apples to apples are cool. and of course drinking games like have you ever, truth or dare, etc. are fun (even if you're not drinking).
Intriguing! Can you do a quick run down of what Ayahuasca is and what it's able to do? I feel I read about this once and someone posted it was the worst thing they're ever done but holds great power.
