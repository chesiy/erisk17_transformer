I [dose this with Flourish and liquid Iron](http://imgur.com/a/wwc9i) about once a month and use under gravel tabs twice a year under the root feeders- other than that the fish take care of it all. The only thing I have put in that didn't do well was some eleocharis that I added from our stream. It's all pretty low care plants.
Mexico has had horrible problems with Rabies- generally due to poverty (people not able to spay or immunize pets). They finally started a national immunization program. I am wondering what the issue is in Nebraska/Kansas.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18634477
The reason for the existence of this sub is the fact that starting about 6 years ago I witnessed the Jet Stream and resulting weather patterns perform more anomalous feats than in my previous 40 years of extreme weather studies. Others were noticing too, and the data was verifying it. Not only that, but the [massive increase in damage to people and infrastructure started being noted.](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/docs/smith-and-katz-2013.pdf)   Then in 2012 Rutgers and University of Japan did a study as to why was the Jet Stream running in these anomalous patterns, slowing, stalling, generating long term droughts and record rainfalls, etc.   Here is a [small video explaining the results.](https://youtu.be/gAiA-_iQjdU) The published paper has stood the test of time and become even more recognized.   And [here is the publication](http://marine.rutgers.edu/~francis/pres/Francis_Vavrus_2012GL051000_pub.pdf) if you want to dig deeper.

7th Shark Attack off North Carolina, 2 more over the weekend.   And now we [are up to 7 attacks](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/06/29/three-new-shark-attacks-in-carolinas-puzzle-experts-and-scare-beachgoers/). And I see a lot of floundering out there as to 'why'. Pier fishing (been going on for decades) more people (Carolinas has had a drop off in tourism, though) blah blah blah.   I'll show you what is most likely the issue right here:   http://www.ospo.noaa.gov/data/sst/anomaly/2015/anomw.6.22.2015.gif  See the dark red spot off the east coast?  That heat anomaly has been there for a month now. Bull sharks (and their prey) typically love warmer water and normally hang around the edges of the Gulf Stream. The Gulf Stream is closer to the coastline around Florida   farther off the coast on the eastern seaboard. Hence more attacks (normally) in Florida.  Right now I am sure they are coming up to that area of heat and feeding / massing around the southern edge of it, which would be the N Carolina coastline. Y'all are collateral damage.  I posted this to /r/StormComing earlier and thought it would be helpful here.
But sheep aren't beholden to the rules of so-called civilized society, and they are happier for it. There are no formalwear occasions, or 'no loitering' signs, or prostate exams, or any of the million things life thrusts upon us that we'd rather not do. Sheep go about eating, shitting and fucking without a care in the world..
Not sure if you are familiar with 2010 heat wave, or the 2009:  By the time the heatwaves had ended in late October 2010, about $500 billion (2011 USD) of damage was done, in the Northern Hemisphere alone. The heat waves had caused around 17,905,000 deaths globally, with 3,000+ direct, 17,821,672+ indirect, and 21+ unconfirmed deaths  Russia: On July 30, wildfires killed 25 people, leaving more than 2000 people homeless. The fires were still burning on 1 August.  Likely in part due to the heat wave and smoke from forest fires, Moscow recorded 14,340 total deaths in the month of July, 4,824 more than the number recorded in July 2009. Pollution levels in the city were five times higher than normal.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Northern_Hemisphere_summer_heat_waves
Identify and fix problems? The day it happened I posted about the problem of 24/7 racist sites - including subs on reddit- and how they can impact the weak minded. I got d/v to hell.   http://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3a9ec9/charleston_church_shootingmanhunt_megathread/csbhgmt  When I was young I listened to Germans who escaped Germany talking to my great grandmother on a regular basis. I know what the effect of 'papering' (as they called the dissemination of racial tracts) can do to drive race-hate. People can deny it all they want but they need to face up to it.   Once an belief has *sanction of approval* by seemingly large numbers of people or government action the believers tend to multiply like cockroaches and start acting out. The Confederate Flag on government land is one type of sanction of approval.

Oil spill off Santa Barbara (we don't want windmills) now up to 105,000 gallons from earlier 'estimate' of 21,000.
Santa Barbara did a study on coyotes killed because they had become urbanized  - autopsies to check their dietary habits. Out of 200 coyotes they found that 80% of their diet was rodents. Rats, wild rabbits, mice and shrews. The rest was mainly garbage. No cats. No dogs.
I like how you put that; 'chupacabra'.   It was while studying the Jarrell that I first discovered Gravity Waves in relation to amping up storms. I have a fascination with resonant waves and effects so it is very interesting.  I had heard of Jarrell, but had not really studied it until during the 2011 outbreak one of the tornados took a 'backward' track and I went into research mode. I cannot recall which tornado that was now.   Thank you for your info. I did not know the other tornados you mentioned were also linked to gravity waves.
Her Etsy page and website has been linked in comments from this morning, they are also linked on the ABC News story- if you bothered to read it you would know this. Since you didn't bother to read it, how you could be so self-assured in attacking this person and her small business?   Obviously I didn't ask for a selfie.   I haven't seen any other shirt design like hers yet- outside of Target.   18 years ago the use of the term 'merica' was unheard of as well as the use of a hashtag.   So I am very doubtful of everything you posted previously.   I am familiar with US design copyright law having known a person who did a design for fabric wall hanging sales- and found her design on an online poster sale site - a clear rip - just as what happened here.   She did sue successfully. Hopefully this woman will be successful as well.
That has absolutely nothing to do with Electronic Copyright Law:   Copyright is a form of protection provided by U.S. law to authors of original works of authorship, including pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works. The owner of copyright in a work has the exclusive right to make copies, pre-pare derivative works, sell or distribute copies, and display the work publicly.     Anyone else wishing to use the work in these ways must have the permission of the author or someone who has derived rights through the author.     A work is automatically protected by copyright when it is created, that is, fixed in a copy or phono record (such as a .psd creation date) for the first time. Neither registration in the Copyright Office nor publication is required for copyright protection.  http://copyright.gov/circs/circ40.pdf
Uh huh.
You reminded me of [this.](http://i.imgur.com/WkD6yNt.jpg).  My second toon I made a few months after beta -she ended up being a 19 twink and had her little rogue partner (usually my daughter or hubby at the helm of that one.)  Best story I have is;  "Back in the day, mages had unlimited sheeps on the battleground. You also had set battlegroups and would regularly play against the same players.  One day this Troll was speed hacking (a method where they would dc quickly/repeatedly and lag the game for other players) and we caught him alone in a hut on WSG. So I repeat sheeped his ass in the hut while my rogue partner stunlocked and killed everything that tried to come rescue him.   We laughed ourselves into hysterics.   Next time we encountered him we did the same thing. From then on out - until they changed the battlegroup system, it was game-on between me and him in every bg we ended up in together.
I am not referring to the 'floating dead' aspect. I am referring to the lack of education, regulation and poverty that let's this continue.  Corporate/Banking groups (mostly multinationals now) are spending millions lobbying for low wages, ending the EPA, ending pollution regulations, ending work safety regulations, destroying what is left of labor power, ending supplemental health care, etc.  This is all part of the "Make gub'ment smaller!" movement.  The result of this, if they are successful, is exactly what you see in India and Bangladesh. Very few ultra rich at the top, wholly unregulated (who never see these streets) and masses of people in poverty.  EDIT: If you have an alternate point to make, man up and debate this instead of dv it.
Here's the deal with 'hungry' fish. Since they have to hunt for food most of their waking hours (in the wild) just to stay alive, they do not have a 'shut off' switch in their brain telling them that they are 'full' -like humans do. They don't need one.   Since you are artificially feeding them please ignore the begging if you know they are actually eating every day. Check bellies after dinner. Unfortunately, consistent food begging by fish has killed more than I like to think about.
Being stopped for no reason is humiliating and destroys police-community relationship.  I remember being taught in school that we were fighting the Cold War because in 'those evil countries' the police could stop people on the street for no reason, spy on them, arrest them on the smallest pretense. We went to Vietnam supposedly to prevent the spread of that behavior around the world. My beloved Uncle died for this. Now to see it codified into law and todays law enforcement officers performing it is both enraging and deeply saddening.   Stop- just stop. This is not fascist/soviet Russia.
