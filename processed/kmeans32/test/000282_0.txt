Life is just a swirling, never ending, sinkhole   I don't usually post here, I usually just lurk sometimes but tonight I feel like posting here for my first time mainly because my life feels like a constant swirling sink hole that dies down for a short, short peroid then just comes back 20x harder. In 2013 I was diagnosed with schizophrenia (and recently OCD) and my life just hasn't been the same since, but not only that I also (most likely) have PTSD because I was brought up by alcoholics (mainly my dad), my first memory ever on this planet was calling the cops on my dad at the age of around 3-4 because he was drunk and violent, I obviously don't understand what I was doing at the time but looking back I do. He never really stopped drinking for any longer than 1 year (and that was the best he done when he tried). I've lived with this alcoholic for longer than some people have even been on reddit and I have no way of leaving because I still need someone to take care of me and I don't want to leave my mum since I love her more than any one in this world.  I don't even feel disappointed anymore if he drinks after being sober for a grand total of 5 days, I just feel anger and pain. He doesn't only drag himself down but he tries to drag my mum down too, but no one can see it except me it feels like. The flashbacks when I try to sleep aren't as common as you would think but the thoughts and memories inside of my head are as common as every day and vivid as the natural daylight. I have scars that have been there since I was younger than 8 (which is a looong time btw). I've had golf clubs swung at my face and I've had glasses thrown at my face (although this might've been my fault as I was protecting my mum), but the worst thing of all is that it always felt like I never had anyone be there for me, not even now, not even friends or anything, I feel super, super alone. When you can hardly have an anxiety-free place in your own house you know that something is wrong, but I'm trapped.   Life = more painful than dying in space near the sun.  Sorry if this is a bad post :(
A few of you? You mean like 3, right?
I'm not even gonna debate AMD with you since you don't have a fucking idea what you're on about but I will say one thing, android phones are usually VERY, VERY good quality, a lot of the time they are better than iPhones and I have an iPhone. I'm actually upgrading to the Samsung S6 later this year or early next.
... What?
Oh good, fuck me right in the ass :D.
Yep, that's true. Around 10%ish, even though it's not fully agreed upon (some say more). But that's not exactly what I was saying in my comment.
It's kinda the same with me and my parents except once I started to not be as good as they thought they told me how shit I was. Parents who do this probably think they're doing something right, when in reality, they're not. They're in fact building either a narcissist or building them up just to fall, it's sad.
The side effects of the drugs don't seem worth it anymore. I was such a zombie that didn't care if he lived or died. Someone could've came in my house and robbed me and I would've just sat there and watched. I'll obviously continue medication if I ever get symptoms again but for the time being, I feel much better without the meds. I've always thought that the medication should only be used short term for when psychosis props up (obviously some people need them all the time, but a lot of us dont).
Some people don't like opiates, simple as that. Even though they're the most addictive class of drugs on planet earth, not everyone likes them. Opiate nausea is pretty common before a tolerance builds, then once you've used for a while it kinda comes back (for me anyway, but I have an unknown stomach condition). The euphoria from opiates is different from other drugs, it's a warm, fuzzy feeling and a feeling that everything is just, fine (especially when nodding out). As I said though, not everyone likes them, there's been countless people on opioid painkillers before and never, ever got addicted (or even felt a buzz or liked the buzz) and then there's people out there that gets addicted to them and loves the high.  Maybe you're someone that just doesn't like opiates... Just because they're extremely addictive doesn't mean that everyone loves the feeling, consider it a blessing.
Yep, the heroin problem is about the same if not worse... I can go to the shop (about 2-5 mins walking distance) and see around 2-3 heroin addicts every time and those are just the ones that are really bad because they've been addicts for decades. Pills on the other hand are probably slightly bigger but definitely nothing like the US, I can find some oxy here and there but mainly the pills consist of prescription stimulants (mainly ritalin), benzodiazepines (namely, valium and temazepam)... Prescription opiates aren't all that big on the streets, because after all, why do we need prescription opiates if we have a shit ton of heroin?
It depends on where you look but they are fentanyl analogues. For example, carfentanil which is tens of thousands more potent than morphine while heroin is only around 5x more potent, but that's pretty much unusable without overdosing. Fentanyl is also stronger than heroin and is around 100x(ish) more potent than morphine. Ohmefentanyl is also a lot stronger at around 6000x (can reach up to 18000x) more potent than morphine. 3-methylfentanyl is also a lot more potent. But if I was to say what was the most potent I would go with either carfentanil, dihydroetorphine or maybe even ohmefentanyl but these opioids cannot be used in humans because they are that potent, for example, carfentanil is active at around 1ug.  Btw, the way you measure opiate potency is by looking at how more potent it is than morphine.
I've had dreams that I done crack and I've never done crack in my life. Every time I took a hit everything would go quiet then everything would pretty much just zap right back in, if that makes sense? Then I would run down to somewhere and look into these mirrors and my pupils would be so big they were coming out of my eyes and shit... Really weird.
Yeah, why not? They look kinda cool.
Like others have said, you can't force anything. You'll have to wait until he's ready, I've lived with two alcoholic parents and I know all too well that forcing someone into treatment is just a disaster waiting to happen, they won't only resent you but they'll relapse over and over and over. My dad has been in and out of treatment for alcoholism for a little over ten years and the longest he's been sober is around a year, now there's not much hope for him. Just be there when he's ready to get help, don't shun him and don't ever turn him away, once he goes through withdrawal (cold turkey, which isn't sustainable btw, users always go back either before the WD is fully complete or after, they need a maintenance) a few times he'll wonder what he's doing and then he'll truly want help.  Also, you can also try /r/Opiates (even though it's full of addicts posting pics, they can be helpful) and /r/OpiatesRecovery  Good luck!
No problem.
Yeah it might not be your goal but if you had the option you would do it (if you were a sociopath) right? Also, look into narcissistic personality disorder or just narcissism (since you said you like talking about yourself). It co exists with antisocial disorders.
I didn't exactly say that he isn't damaging it, he's obviously mildly damaging it but the other dude said that he's "KILLING" his liver. I don't exactly think he's killing his liver with only 900mg over the recommended limit.
I'm pretty sure it is but not to the extent of heavy recreational use of course. Amphetamines use a lot of dopamine and serotonin and pretty much deplete these receptors (thats pretty much why you come down) and someone who takes them every day for a few years would definitely have some brain chemistry changes.   I remember being on methylphenidate (ritalin) and I would have to take breaks every weekend just to EAT, so if someone is not eating enough and basically starving themselves due to no appetite could that also damage the brain? Because I know that korsakoffs syndrome is caused by a thiamine deficiency usually seen in alcohol but can happen because of malnutrition too. (Legit question, even if it seems dumb).
Okay... /u/iCoy told you why scamming ruins the game and you just replied with, 100% irrelevant, as if you don't care that people get scammed (or you don't think its that bad that it can ruin a game) therefore you probably have scammed people in the past, think about it...
Codeine varies between person to person because it's a pro drug. Some people lack a certain enzyme and don't get anything out of it, not even pain relief because their bodies can't properly process it into morphine (or not at all). Anyway, I would dose about 120-180mg (I would really start with around 120-128 though.   DPH would help with nausea and it will also make the effects stronger (I personally used to like promethazine though, if you can get that).   Have fun and don't make a habit out of it.
That's true but it just seems so funny man, like you've got a bank of drugs in your house.
BUT SCOTLAND ISN'T THIRD WORLD, ARGHHHH. *stabbed*.
This has to be just silver 1's, no nova with half a brain is like this.  Also, nice smurfing, I totally respect that. /s
They really should make an official statement on how it exactly works, would help me understand why I rank up fast sometimes but slow other times, even though I either do better, or the same.
Yes, yes you do. *hugs*
Fires smell good... I don't know why, but they do.   Note: I don't set stuff on fire.
I honestly think Half Life 3 or EP3, will still be coming out... You know, they could be doing this all for marketing. Making people wait 10 or maybe 15 years, that could drive sales through the roof when it finally comes out, I would think.
Why do I need a t-shirt to prove I like certain music?   Well, basically, I've liked Nirvana for a couple of months as of now, their music is/was just great, but when I mention I like Nirvana or whatever, someone, somewhere, always says, "Then why don't you have Nirvana T-shirts", or, "You're not a true fan of *enter musician here* if you don't have their *MERCH*". It pisses me off because it basically says, even if you like a band or musician or whatever, if you don't have their "merch" then you're not a true fan or a big of a fan as me... As if it's a contest, FUCK YOU to whoever does this.
I can tell you this with experience, a lot of the time when someone gets a prescription for oxy, sooner or later, they will do something illegal with it (snorting, injecting, or just taking it for a buzz and no longer for pain). Criminalizing anyone for drug abuse/use when they are otherwise a loving parent is just, insane. Also, I think you CAN do something about it, YOU can also fight back at the heart of it.  And it would be nice to become a foster parent when I'm a little older.   But can't you just change something at the core? Yeah, we should do something to, but YOU (and others that work in the system) can change it at it's very core.
But what I'm telling you is just what I've gathered from a lot of health professionals (neurologists and stuff also) and about a year and a bit of opiate use.   So schizophrenia wasn't really caused by anything for me, it's just stuff I've gathered from health pros :).   And even they don't even fully understand the brain
I feel like I'm a pussy for not being able to handle it better, sometimes I think everyone has what I have and they're just better at dealing with it and I'm lower than everyone.  Thank you, a lot. I don't know if I've hit rock yet, but I think I'm slowly getting there, but I don't want to, I want to go up NOW!!!
The longest I've made it is nearly 2 weeks lol, I've tried many times... But bad shit in life when you're trying to stop seems even worse, and that's what always makes me go back, ill try and make today my last:)
