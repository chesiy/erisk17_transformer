I don't want to be here anymore, and apparently others don't want me either.   The person I most looked to in the world has told me they're better off without me, as most people do when they speak to me over time. I don't fit into the world, I don't have a place, and I just make people angry and hate me. I'd make the world better by simply not existing. What am I supposed to do, make people suffer my presence? It doesn't seem right.
Very impressive sir, I like it :p, thank you :D
XD love it
i just preferred if the map makers did their own lore for the map they made, rightfully so. And you're welcome, i did my best! :P
And I do :/
Thank you :D

http://www.reddit.com/r/playmindcrack/comments/2e8uwa/dwarves_vs_zombies_the_deathseeker/   I fight because I find myself obligated, but when the fights are boring, and I relive my losses, I quit, and give my memories, as well as protect the sword I am sworn to, Orion.

Your last point would be extremely cruel, because we just want to play games like anyone else, that's why titles don't have  more powerful weapons (with the exception of the Staff, dealing an extra half heart) so I see no reason why we should be hindered, just because we are titled. There are plenty of people without titles that are better than me, and they wouldn't be hindered. Also, I see no reason to nerf procs, and rob has mentioned before, he will not do any rebalancing until after heroes are reintroduced, but I think procs are fine, in my opinion.
Dwarves vs. Zombies observed changes 2/1/14   So, as you may know, DvZ is still a WIP, as heroes are not finished, sounds still need to be added, and new maps are still needed. However, there was another "balancement" update rather than "content" update today, and these are the changes I observed:  * Procs are now limited to within 5 blocks of your person, so basically, **bow proccing is removed.** * Golems are readded, ~~however, spawn with only a seppuku, so they do not have much of a function other than a walking damage soaker.~~ **They now spawn once again with the ancient pick.** * **Healing ale now uses 150 mana** rather than 200 from before. * Mount Willakers has invulnerability added upon monster spawn (18 seconds). * As of this moment, ~~I did not see any instances of squid (maybe rarer?)~~, ~~wolves (also rarer?)~~, ~~or the map oasis (removed?)~~ ~~and have not played on any map other than Mt Willy to see if they have arrow invul too~~. * ~~WE GOT FANCY SPECIAL MONSTER MESSAGES, I LOVE YOU ALL.~~ **SPIDER KING MESSAGES ARE MESSED UP, PRAISE REDACTED.**  I myself enjoy these changes, it makes indoor combat easier, shields have more use outside, and spawn camping isn't devastating anymore, at least from what I observed.  As stated by nisovin below:   * **Sword damage was increased to 10** rather than 8 (~~**PALADINS, USE THE RUNEBLADE, THE HOLY BLADE IS NOT UPDATED**~~ Fixed.). * All map's invulnerability was increased (18 seconds). * Squids are, in fact, removed. * Oasis, is in fact, removed. * Holy Blades and Longbows are shiny again, keep in mind they **DO NOT** do anything extra, just shine.  In a speculation: (as per substitutemyown): An event, rather it be randomly occurring (most likely this, as if it were a special monster event almost) or admin controlled, that occurs during the day known as the Solar Eclipse will block out the sun, and cause havoc among the dwarves, as the zombies regain their buff.  Side note, I would gladly make more of these if people want, it's kinda fun, always pondered the idea of a constantly changing guide, maybe one day... :P
I'm not missed either, no worries :P
Match posts must be made at least an hour in advance.
The correct format for this particular match is "Sep 30 18:00 UTC - dannyminez's #3 To3 Endurance (Sign Up)"
test_subject5099
Sep 22 09:00 UTC - *
"Long Distance" To2 with solos and FFA with allies of 1 and no backstabbing are the exact same thing, infact, I've seen some hosts tp allies together before, there has to be a set description for these scenarios, it seems just too common that the two blend together.
Do you have an alternate ip? I cannot resolve the hostname due to the type of ip this is.
So you said you will open at 21:30, but you opened 5 minutes before that... Why?
First of all, your title should be in the format of MMM DD HH:MM UTC - (Information), Secondly, you should be using UTC time, not GMT, which are the same, but UTC is used here. Thirdly, the only information you have is the gametype, time, and the nether, no subrules or other paraphernalia. Please look at other posts and follow the format next time.
woo
Hopefully, all went well except that the whitelist should have been cut off at the time you got twenty, and that you should have pregened.
It would have been fine if you used better judgement and known that the person that killed you would have won no matter what, your hosting skills can be improved on, but the pinata thing was the worst idea I've ever heard. Almost like Gammex, and that's pretty bad. I didn't get to play anyway, you banned me...
GG, that win was a bit cheaty, but we killed so many in the portal. Thank you swyrnd for helping me win!
Why hello there, I'm test_subject5099 (I prefer JT personally), and I've been around since May 2013. I personally love the competition, and play a lot of  FFAs, but team games are always fun (I prefer random teams games over chosen, but that's just me.). Always have fun, and remember, pots are op, and enchantments first!
mwahahahahaha
I'll (try to) be there!
Yeah, I had similar gear as shadowlego, and 5 golden apples (+ full health) and was against the wall, but then someone attacked with what I assumed was a strength potion or a really good sword, while 3 others were   charging at me, and died in one hit. I didn't even get to heal due to as many people as there were.
It didn't matter who said it, i was merely asking why it said that, when that obviously is not a sign of good hosting. Replying "shut the fuck up" also is not, and was completely uncalled for, I replied back as narrow minded as you did. I'm not the only one that had a problem with your matches, or this being the first, and I'm sure, not the last, you may want to learn to respect people before they will respect you, and don't go "you swore at me, nyanya" While it may not have been one of the most mature things I've done, you swore at me first, and I don't "bow down" to hosts, I play with them mutually, and respect them. You, I have no respect for whatsoever.
Apparently you could have logged back in, and I had asked the host (who, contrary to what it says here, was t4t4t4t4, not actually_yes) why he had not replied, and he said he was afk. I then complained that he had said "this is an impromptu, do not complain about lag and bad hosting" and i said that gave no right to not host correctly. To that, actually_yes replied with "shut the f*ck up" and i replied back as narrow minded as he did. He then banned me for: faggot.
