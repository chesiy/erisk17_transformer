Plenty of options in Kansas City.  I would recommend Water Works.  It's pretty close to I-35. Waterworks Park 100192 Water Works Rd Kansas City, MO  64116 United States
Hole 1 Beaver Ranch - spot the mule deer
As someone who plays Cliff on a semi regular basis, thank you!!  People treat that park like it is their own private dump.  Well done sir.
Simply perfection.  So many smiles.
Hen House had them on sale for $5 each
I love the Midwest - $5.25 KC strip
Pizzaman in Lenexa off Pflumm and 103rd.  Chicago family owned - thin crust.  They have a killer Italian Beef pizza - just do it.

I should have been more specific on 'drive'.  It was a fairway drive not from the teebox.  He was still only 5-10 feet away.
my friends and i play down under at least once a week and only bring a buzzz.  it's a lot of fun.
How are the courses in the Chicago area?
i took the water works photo sunday.  history won't begin to unfold until 7pm today.  here's a pic i took at game 4 http://imgur.com/5IvW2dO
agreed.  i took this about 50 feet past the tee pad.

here's a pic of our camp.  we moved the tents into the trees during hours of operation and had the course to ourselves after 7pm each night.  http://imgur.com/W1EHinM
I purchased the Weber Genesis in Green of Amazon a couple months ago.  It was delivered for free to my backyard (I helped the driver).  Assembling the unit proved to be simple - this isn't an Ikea grill.  I've been grilling constantly since I purchased it and am extremely happy with it.  Just rip the bandaid and do it!
parboil the carrots for 8-10 minutes, toss in olive oil, salt, pepper, raw sugar, grill for 10 minutes on high direct heat.  like candy!
recipe!?

home repairs.   not only do you save money but you never have to worry about someone screwing you over.  there's so many youtube videos on how to fix toilets, add thermostats, install garbage disposal etc.  it's not as hard as you think.  (TWSS)
my roommate did this several times.  other times he would rip open a bag of salad, pour it on the counter, pour ranch onto said salad/counter and eat with his hands.
hit Dynamic Discs right around the corner from Oklahoma Joe's.  http://www.dynamicdiscs.com/kansas-city-disc-golf/

Apparently they make an exception for him.  He must not be as big of a cunt as some of you turds think.
This man had a beard.  Does your grandpa also wear a hat that says 'If you're not wasted, the day is'? If so, I have his business card ;)
i should have been more clear - he was a patron not a worker.  he's always there - that's how you contact him.  oh, and he writes a check every time.
pax broken - lid won't close - suggestions?
Anton's steakbooger is damn tasty.

it appears you received some great info already.  i moved to KC from WI in 2004.  in 2008 i moved to FL for a new job.  i just moved back to KC in july of 2013 because i couldn't stand FL!   i'm so happy to be back in the midwest!  here are a few things i noticed having lived in both states (i lived in boca raton/fort lauderdale area):  1)  the people here are ridiculously nice.  if you make eye contact in public chances are the person will smile or say hi.   in florida i felt that if i made eye contact with a stranger that they would want to fight or run the other way.  the fake people in So.FL are the worst.  everyone is trying to one up each other.    2)  traffic.  anyone that has only lived in the greater KC area and complains about KC traffic, you haven't been to FL.  i don't miss the snowbirds or the tourists lost while looking for disney.  3)  cost of living.  when living in FL you're paying tourist prices.  i don't miss waiting for a table anytime i wanted to go out to eat.    4)  parks.  KC has some amazing parks.  what i experienced in florida was that it was so crowded that parks didn't really exist.  builders in florida would rather put a few high rises and make more money.  5)  the weather.  while people in FL are probably asking how you could leave FL for KS, the weather is very fair here.  people will tell you, if you don't like the weather in KC, just wait a day, it will change.  while living in FL i really started to miss the midwest seasons.
