I have asked you to cite the federal power listed in the constitution that allows them to keep states in the union against their will.  ... Jesus Christ, just how many chromosomes are you missing?  The Constitution, by virtue of existing and having no secession clause, creates a binding compact.   You have also woefully misreported the 10th amendment.  Well, I guess either both I and 230 years of Supreme Court decisions are wrong, or someone who can't handle basic logic is wrong.  I mean, the Tenth Amendment relies upon assuming states being part of the existing federal framework.  What's so fucking hard to understand about that?
OK?  I'm not sure what your point is, but that's because I'm pretty sure you don't actually have one.
Hmmm.  Spoilers, obviously.  Brys Beddit dissecting Rhulad Sengar.  The Church scene from *Kingsman*.  Logan Ninefingers vs. Golden whateverhisnamewas in *Red Country*.  Mark Vorkosigan taking down Baron Ryoval.  If we include battles, pretty much every major battle written by Steve Erikson in the *Malazan Books of the Fallen*, but especially the Siege of Capustan, the Chain of Dogs, and Second Yghatan.  I'm sure I'll think of more later.
Harkness and surrounding area are great, if you want to focus on it for a few days, not really a highlight worth additional driving if you're pressed for time.  Ah, I'm definitely not pressed for time when it comes to the Park.  I live on the road leading to Juniper, so I can make a day trip a few times a week, if I like.
There are a bunch of towns mentioned as being near Newarre (Rannish   Baedn, for example), and a few mentioned as being near the bandit camp (Crosson, etc.), but no overlap.  The map found in the bandit camp also seems to imply a great deal of distance from any town, unlike the short walk Bast takes to get to the lightning tree.  There's a greystone near the lightning tree, which Kvothe would be sure to notice at some point when dealing with the bandits.  And, most importantly, the lightning tree is on a hill, the bandit camp was in a small valley (a "bowl" as Kvothe describes it).  There's just nothing to connect to the two.
They would have preferred OBL to remain alive to make Obama look bad.  It's not so much that, as that it didn't happen while Bush was President.  Because, you see, Jesus Cowboy Bush was just *supposed* to bring in bin Laden, "Wanted Dead or Alive Poster" style.  And when that pre-conceived narrative didn't happen, they just couldn't handle the reality of what *did* happen.
Nothing.  It's just ... man, don't worry about it.  It all just sucks.  Have a drink then have another one.  Then another one.  Shit's just fucked up.
OK.  Photographic evidence, video evidence, separatists admitting to journalists that the Russian military was helping, vehicles flying Russian flags ... I guess that's all meaningless.  Because you just *don't think it's true*, little Russia-bot, that's what's important.
I'm just confused as to how they think  See, it's best just to leave it at that.
This is completely and utterly wrong about pine.  It's perfectly fine to use as your sole source of firewood (a lot of people where I live, including myself, do so).  The sap content doesn't really matter when seasoned, and I have no idea what "burns messy" is supposed to mean - it doesn't really generate more ash or creosote than oak or almond.
Things look pretty cool from up there.  Enjoy the view, if you have a window seat.  If you don't ... I don't know.  Just don't whimper and cry, it bothers the rest of us.
I'd be fine with adding the *Izumo*s, but not the *Hyuga*s, as I haven't seen any sign their decks could withstand the heat from any STOVL aircraft.  I mean, if you're going to include the *Thai*-tanic, and the Italian and Spanish jump-jet carriers, you may as well include the *America*.
Does anyone even care that Jerry Rice did?  I think the problem is that now, a lot of other receivers from that era can *claim* they didn't, whether they did or not, to make themselves look better.  But much like pine-tar or scuffing the ball for more than a century of major league pitching, we all know everyone did it.
Everything in my life.  Sorry, I meant EVERYTHING FUCKING THING in my life.  From being so broke I'm soon to be evicted, to the fact that I haven't so much as touched a girl in nearly six years and I'm still in my 30s, to that fact that I can't get a job and I don't know why even when plenty of people are willing to speak up for and recommend me, to the fact that fuck this.  Just fuck this.
What do you prefer to make from scratch, instead of buying processed, packaged, and store-bought?   I'm especially talking about things with complex recipes, where the store-bought version has a long shelf-life but the home-made version has to be used fairly fast.  In my case, it's Caeser dressing - started doing so a week ago, and I'll never go back to the bottled stuff, though there are plenty of decent brands out there.  I still haven't done ranch because of the short fridge-life of buttermilk, but that's probably up next.
I like this game.
