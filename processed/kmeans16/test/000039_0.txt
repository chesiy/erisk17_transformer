This is my hand made variable wattage OKR wooden box mod I made myself. It includes a master on/off switch, fire button, potentiometer, blue LED, and a 5/10 thread to mount any RDA. The internal components include a battery sled, 2 Sony VTC5s all copper wiring, zenor diode, an OKR 1/10 variable wattage chip, a few capacitors, and 4 rare earth magnets to hold on the lid. The wood is hand cut and worked using mahogany and I used guerrilla wood glue to attach the corners. From there I sanded it and stained it.Then did some wood burning  As you can see its a bit haggard from lots of use. It isn't perfect but its something I made and have pride in and something no one else has. This is the first one I've built so the next one I build should be an improvement. Anyways I thought Id share. Open to any questions or critiques.
Jesus Christ! If you want to be an asshole about this whole thing then lets take a look at your beautiful very polite post we have here. Not a shred of reasoning to disprove anything. I thought this was a safe place with knowledgeable individuals. Put down the bong? Really? All I was doing was throwing a theory out there and hoping for intelligent people to explain why this definitively could not work because I sincerely want to know. None of which you addressed. like the idea of that dark matter and black holes may be linked which is probably non-since but I guess ideas (even exotic ones) are worthless to you. I have studied astrophysics, graduated, and somehow I still manage to not be a total dick. I just wanted to throw out a crazy idea that I wanted others to disproof and talk about. After all isn't that the basis of new ideas? Thank you for your very awesome post that will surly incurage me to be less open minded. Much apreciated
What's in the Cincinnati box in the Hot Tub Time Machine movies?   Does anyone out there have any ideas what might be in the Cincinnati box in the Hot Tub Time Machine movies? I just watched the second one and they mention the box a lot more than the first movie but still no clues to whats in it. If you haven't seen the second movie please still give some ideas because like I said you know just as much about the box even if you haven't seen the second movie. I read that the writers of the films may be trying to make another movie that starts off with this mystery or is based around it but I got the impression at the end of the second movie that they won't be making anymore. Please comment if you have any knowledge about this as well. Remember that the Cincinnati box is a shoe box so whatever it contains must fit in it (or does it?) I'm curious what we can come up with.

I also read somewhere that Suboxone added the Naloxone to its recipe just so they could patent the name because just bup was taken by the brand subutex and that bup itself is the primary blocker and the low dose of the Naloxone doesnt do much at all. If what I read is right then suboxone and subutex block opiates the same way and you can't feel a p30 on eather. Please help me guys cause I thought this was common knowlage but my friend thinks hes 100% sure.
same here. My two Jacks each have one and they are the only ones still standing. This one is the same way, she will put the ball on any part of my body so she knows I can feel it. She likes to put it up against my lower back when I'm sitting because she knows it drives me crazy and I will keep throwing it. It amazes me how smart this breed is!
We ended up going to the jewely store today. Got the ring cut off professionally and it can now be repaired and sized. [HERES](http://i.imgur.com/72R5CHd.jpg) a pic. And one of her [FINGER](http://i.imgur.com/VeWTRWW.jpg)
I don't but I could make some and post it. Now that I think of it I really should share my plans because its amazing how effective it is. The difference is like popping a balloon with a pin and untying the knot and letting the air out slow. PM me if you need the plans asap. But I will make some and post it on this sub.
Hey, thanks a lot. I appreciate it!

I know, I love this picture. Shes almost 3 years old now and still melts my heart. *tear
