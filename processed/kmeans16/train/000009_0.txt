When you understand probabilities you will be less frustrated. Example: If you have a steal rate of 5% for a particular item, thats a 1 in 20 chance  (not great but not terrible), the issue arises when you fail to consider that consecutive steal attempts do not increase the odds of getting the item. Every attempt is still only 5%, it's a common phalicy to believe independent events alter probabilities. So my advice...be patient.
