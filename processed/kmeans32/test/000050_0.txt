BBC - Secrets of the animals that dive deep into the ocean (with graphic)
Hey, I graduated from OSU this past spring with a BS in E E and am now in a Marine Bio Master's program!  My advice on where to start is to find and read recent papers on topics that interest you.  This will give you an idea of what you are really interested in and could get passionate about (remember, you're going to be thinking about a single topic 24/7 for at least the next 2 years while doing your thesis, so you need to be sure you like it).  Then you should look up the authors of papers that caught your attention and contact people than you could see yourself working with.  It's much more important to have an advisor you feel you can be successful with than to go to a renowned Marine Bio program.  Also, don't get discouraged by rejection!  I emailed between 30 and 40 professors, got a reply from maybe 10, and only interviewed with 3.  Lucky for me, one of those 3 was my top choice for an advisor.   If you have any other questions or would just like to talk more about this more, feel free to PM me.  Go Bucks!
Taxonomically, yes.  Whales are any species that belong to the order Cetacea and oceanic dolphins are any species that belong to the family Delphinidae (river dolphins encompass a few different families).  So from a taxonomic context, you'd be correct saying a killer whale is a whale, correct and more specific saying a killer whale is a dolphin, correct and most specific saying a killer whale is an oceanic dolphin, but wrong saying a killer whale is not a dolphin (or an oceanic dolphin).   But this might not be the case in common nomenclature.  People tend to call small whales with a pronounced rostrum, "dolphins," which is a characterization that killer whales (and other "blackfish" - pilot whales, false killer whales, and pygmy killer whales) don't fit.  And there are also dolphins without pronounced beaks, such as the Risso's and Irrawaddy dolphins but they're smaller than .  River dolphins are not in the family Delphinidae, but are still called dolphins because of the large rostrums they have. Generally speaking, people call big cetaceans "whales," small cetaceans with conical teeth "dolphins," and small cetaceans with spade-shaped teeth "porpoises."  So from a common nomenclature context, you wouldn't be wrong calling a killer whale a whale since they're large relative to the other members of the family Delphinidae and the river dolphins and they don't have a pointy beak.  TL;DR: there's a difference between taxonomic and common nomenclature - in common nomenclature, many families are lumped together as "dolphins" and large oceanic dolphins are called "whales."

Thanks!  I've heard positive things about massive and as long as it's as robust as I've heard, I may just stick with that (plus whatever comes with the DAW I decide to buy) for now.  This is definitely just a recreational activity for me so I think it might be best to go with the easier one for now.

If you're looking for rap over a dubstep beat, one of my favorites is [Like This (feat. Virus Syndicate)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xishhKPQ9Nw feature=kp) by SKisM.  Flux Pavilion was who really got me hooked onto dubstep - [I Can't Stop is one of his most well known songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q9rewnLFYw) but he also does a song called [Do or Die](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRNqRuyFSXk) with rap from Childish Gambino.  I also recommend [Dodge   Fuski](https://soundcloud.com/dodgeandfuski).  I love [Zomboy](https://soundcloud.com/zomboy) as well.  If you're interested in a more melodic/chill kind of sound, Seven Lions also makes great melodic dubstep.  His remix of [Running to the Sea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFZREifFcEs) is one of my most favorite songs right now.  A majority of the dubstep artists I listen to are signed on to either on [Never Say Die Records](http://www.wewillneversaydie.com/mixes/) or [Disciple Recordings](http://www.disciplerecs.com/mixes/), both of which release free mixes made by their artists periodically.  I'd say my favorites at NSD are SKisM, Zomboy, and Eptic.  Disciple Recs is younger, so I only really know Dodge   Fuski (who used to be with NSD), but I'm really liking what Pegboard Nerds and Astronaut are putting out.  You should also check out the artists over at [OWSLA](http://owsla.com/artists/), which is where Skrillex and Seven Lions are signed.  Kill Paris, Kill the Noise, and Porter Robinson are also great from OWSLA.  As far as trap goes, I don't listen to much, but I do like things by Brillz, LOUDPVCK, RL Grime, Buku, and Baauer.  Sorry this turned into a wall of text, but hopefully this will help you find something you like!
A New, More Humane Way to Euthanize Stranded Whales [x-post from r/whales]
Very interesting and multifaceted question.  I will try to hit the major points of it and will use a comment I wrote about a similar question I answered about a week ago to broaden it.  I'm also going to try to correct some misconceptions you write, but please try not to take them with any hard feelings!   there are two sides to every story  This is correct, and as an avid supporter of the movie Blackfish, I feel it is important to note that it is an activist film.  I've studied the captivity issue for about as long as the director of the movie has, but unfortunately some of the information is presented in a biased or false manner.  For example, the scientist that studies the whales around Puget Sound said that a wild orca whale has never harmed a person, but wikipedia [has a list of what could be considered attacks, including one on a surfer that was extremely severe.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_whale_attacks_on_humans)  Also the movie doesn't explain that, Tilly was caught with another young whale, and both were kept in a giant tank in a hangar-like building in Europe and trained there through punishment before he could be moved to Canada.  I believe I read this in the book, [Death at SeaWrold by David Kirby](http://deathatseaworld.com/), but I which the movie would have talked about this more because I believe this early trauma was just as important as that he received at Sealand of the Pacific.  It may direct some of the public hatred away from the captive parks themselves, but I think it would make the movie feel less biased.  Although I think the backlash the captive industry is receiving is justified, I had a sour taste in my mouth from these two instances in the film the first time I watched it.  If you are interested in the topic of captivity, I would suggest you look into Death at SeaWorld, as well as the documentary, [A Fall From Freedom](http://vimeo.com/40600148), and the Frontline special, [A Whale of a Business.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fZ2dMdtu8)   He now sits in a seperated tank and is cordoned off from everyone else  According to SeaWorld, he was kept alone because he was afraid of the tanks that had the new safety floors installed, but they have been trying to acclimate him to them.  I don't know if this is true or not since I haven't been there in about a decade, but I hope the trainers wouldn't let him be isolated for something he did almost 4 years ago.   starving the animals of food to perform so that they can be fed  They don't starve the animals at SeaWorld since they need the animals to be healthy.  They do something they call positive reinforcement.  Essentially, the whales do something the trainers like and the whales get something they like.  The whales get fed outside of shows (I've seen this myself), but it wouldn't surprise me (as stated in Blackfish) if the meals are cut before important shows to make the whales more likely to perform.  I've been at shows where one or two of the whales aren't interested in performing, so I know that the whales don't feel it's completely necessary for their survival that they go through with every single performance.  This is my own personal opinion, but I would equate the shows with a set of weights in a prison yard - it's mostly something to keep the whales somewhat occupied during their barren, under-stimulated existences.   why can't we just end the captivity and performing of these wild animals? I understand that it is a huge revenue stream  You answered your own question.  SeaWorld is a huge business, which is why these animals are still performing.  If people didn't go to see cetaceans in captivity, the captive industry would grind to a halt.  However, this would lead to the discussion of what to do with the animals, which is actually very complicated.  I'd say that it would be impossible to release all of the captive killer whales (not to mention the other captive marine mammals) and expect them all to survive.  I think the whales that were born in the wild would have an easier time adjusting back to that kind of lifestyle than would the captive-born whales that had never experienced a natural environment. I'm sure you could train all of them to hunt though, at least enough to get by.  Also, the price would be astronomical.  Keiko was a challenge and he was 1 whale, I can't imagine funding and organize the release of the almost 30 orca owned by SeaWorld (or the 54 total in captivity worldwide).  What would be even more challenging would be to determine where to release captive-born whales (34 of the 54 worldwide). SeaWorld's wild whales came from 2 different parts of the world - the Pacific Northwest (U.S. and Canada) and the North Atlantic (Iceland). They have also recently been getting sperm from an orca named Kshamenk, who resides at Mundo Marino and was captured off the coast of Argentina. Orca have very distinct cultures, for example, in the Pacific Northwest, there are 4 distinct "cultures" - Northern Residents, Southern Residents, Transients, and Offshores - that rarely interact and never interbreed. These "cultures" each have their own unique forms of communication, known as dialects. The North Atlantic population is less studied than the Pacific Northwest population, but I assume there are also distinct "cultures" in that population.  Keiko was released in the general area that he was captured in and was seen traveling with other whales from time to time, but it never seemed that he was accepted into any pod. I have a feeling that other North Atlantic whales, such as Tilikum, would probably end up in a similar position if released, but it is hard to say since Keiko spent so much of his life in isolation. Springer, a Southern Resident whale in the Pacific Northwest who was orphaned and rehabilitated in a sea pen, was adopted by her aunt's pod, so it's possible that a whale like Lolita at the Miami Seaquarium could be taken in by a pod if she were released, since she was captured from a Southern Resident pod. Back to the captive-born whales. Many of them are genetic mixtures of Pacific Northwest, North Atlantic, and now Southern Atlantic whales. This means that it's possible wild whales could reject them based on morphology alone. Not to mention how incestual the genetic lines are in the SeaWorld whales, which makes it difficult to decide how to define what a family group is amongst the captive whales and how to divide them between release locations.  I would be interested in finding out how the whales communicate at the parks now. If the captive-born ones seem to be using a dialect similar to any one particular group that was passed down to them by the older wild-caught whales, maybe they could be released in the area where that dialect originates. That's assuming that the whales haven't come up with their own crude captive (possibly even park-specific) dialect(s). If they did that, you could make the case of releasing them all together in one spot, but that probably wouldn't be the best idea since some of the captive whales seem to show high levels of aggression towards one another. Also, there probably aren't many places that have a local ecology that could handle such an influx of apex predators. Plus, the released whales would probably act like Keiko and seek out human interaction, which would be especially bad for them if they were to congregate in a high-traffic, highly populated area.    Why can't we just release them back into the wild and if people want to see them go on Whale Watching tours, visit a national park, or just go out to that animal's natural habitat and observe them being them, rather than performing some mundane trick for your enjoyment.  These are much better options in my opinion, but are not perfect.  Whale watching can be rather hit-or-miss when it comes to seeing the whales or dolphins you want to see, and you rarely (if ever) get as close to the animals as you do in captive facilities.  Captivity gives the public this sense of bonding with the animals, even though it's completely fabricated and unrealistic.  Visiting natural habitats also has it's problems.  For example, there is an issue with the amount of pollution in the Galapagos Islands (which are considered a nature reserve) from the sheer number of tourists that visit the area annually.  I'm hoping that as technology improves, we'll have things like simulators or maybe ROVs or something awesome that hasn't even been thought of yet that can bring more people the joys of the natural world around us without imposing the problems of more people on the wilderness.    But anyway, in terms of captivity, I think the best route for us to take is to focus on the young, recently captured whales, like Morgan from the Netherlands who was captured in 2010, Narnia from Russia who was captured in 2012, or the 7 whales captured in Russia in September and October of 2013.  If any whales were able to be successfully released, it would most likely be these whales.  Let me know if you're interested in more information on this subject, I'd be more than happy to either elaborate or provide you with some direction on where to look!  I'd apologize for the wall of text, but this topic is a passion of mine and I think it needs to be explained as thoroughly as possible!
Possibly.

So, if by survive you mean not die immediately of starvation then probably, but if you mean live like a normal wild whale then the answer is almost definitely not.

It could definitely (and probably does) cause auditory hearing loss because their ears work very much like ours.  The sonar mechanism is a little more tricky.  I'm on mobile now and like I said earlier, I'm feeling particularly tired/lazy so I'm going to try to explain what I can remember about it (which isn't much).  Small cetaceans have an organ on the top of their head called a melon.  I can't recall what's in it, but it's either fluid-filled or fatty and it's highly malleable.  They use it to alter the high frequency sound waves they emit, which bounce off objects in the water.  They receive the returning waves through ~~hollows~~ special sound conducting tissues in their lower jaw, ~~which is either gas-filled or fluid-filled~~, and this amplifies it for them.  ~~I'm not sure off the top of my head if the sonar waves go from the jaw to the ears or if they have another avenue to the brain, but I'll definitely look it up when I get a chance in the next day or so.~~  The sound waves then travel to the inner ear.  So the loud music probably wouldn't damage the melon or jawbone to produce and receive the sonar, but it could affect the inner ear, which is used for auditory hearing as well ~~I'm not sure about the sonar processing pathway.  If it's the ears then it would, but I have a feeling it's not~~.  Echolocation seems to not be as important as auditory hearing though, which I was surprised to learn.  It seems even less important for captive cetaceans, since their environment never changes and is pretty free of obstacles. They probably learn quickly how to avoid running into the walls or bottom at night if it's too dark too see and don't need to use sonar much after that.  EDIT: [NOAA link](http://www.afsc.noaa.gov/nmml/education/cetaceans/cetaceaechol.php) that has good info!

Your sister does a great thing!  I'm glad that you and your sister have been able to help him so much.  I've only ever had small pets like fish and mice, but I'm readying a book on the study of animal personalities and it's made me think about many other animals, and mammals in particular, have sets of behaviors that can be as complex and unique as humans.  Those stories you shared were very heartwarming :)
Awh :(  Hopefully the little guy headed back home after he saw you weren't able to give him any more attention!
That's really cool, actually!  Dogs seem to respond to high-stress situations much better than people do
What was it?
Are there any particularly fun/unique experiences you've had with your dog?
Are these rubber-tipped sticks?  If they're not and the guy has decent chops he could probably do some damage to the treadmill.
Blue and beaked whales affected by simulated navy sonar
I wrote the previous comment at work and guessed on the date.  In his 1867 book *Mimicry, and Other Protective Resemblances Among Animals* (and later, his 1879 paper published in *Science*), Alfred Russel Wallace suggested stripes evolved in order to provide camouflage from predators by allowing zebras to blend in with the surrounding area. This particular hypothesis was refuted by Darwin and others since the stripes do not blend with the usual zebra habitat of short grasses, but the more recent adaptation is that the stripes confuse predators by making it difficult to single out an individual in the group.  However, zebras tend to live in small groups or are solitary, so this might not even be the case.  Some other hypotheses are that the stripes are for social benefits (sexual selection or communication), thermoregulation, and protection from parasites (tsetse flies in particular).  Darwin thought it might be for intrasexual selection and described an experiment in which a female zebra and a male wild ass are placed together and the female zebra would only let the wild ass mate with her when the researchers painted stripes him.  Personally, I think zebra stripes are least likely to be for predator avoidance, but that seems to be the one that has stuck in society's list of animal myths.
Mmmhmm.
