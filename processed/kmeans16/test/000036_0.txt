"Two Years A Cast Member" A college thesis turned blog series, hilarious look at Disneyland employment
Put contact info in your bio (your email, and email that you create, don't matter it's up to you). I bet you'll be approached to sell that, especially if you make it easy with the contact info. I'm not sure for other countries, but as you probably know it's common practice to get paid for good usernames, even tho it's against the TOS. It happens though, and if your name is the name of the show, then I'd hold tight. Maybe try opening a different account for your personal stuff, now.
I wish I had money to give you gold for this comment. Instead, I've screenshot it and sent it to my friends to have a laugh with me. Thanks.
I just recently left in Feb. But I know a lot about the interviews and how recruiters think.  Like a previous poster said, smile. Always smile. Don't talk about how much you love Disneyland. They don't care who your favorite character is or how many times you've been. When they ask you your number one concern, it is ALWAYS safety. Think about how the four keys of Disneyland (Safety, Courtesy, Show, Efficiency) affect your role and answer the questions in that way. You're not supposed to know those keys right now so don't talk about knowing them but casually mentioning them would be prime (i.e. "I recognize that to be a great CM, I have to be courteous to all guests when performing my role." That's another one: don't forget to think of yourself when answering questions as a part of a show, a cast member with a role.  That's about it. They typically offer the jobs on the spot if they like you.  Good luck. Say hi to the Mouse for me.
Wow. I'm extremely humbled by this. That's my tweet. I started posting my tweets in Nov to get feedback on my jokes and reddit has been very kind to me. Seeing someone else post my own tweets is so crazy.  To clarify, I work at Disneyland and teenagers run rampant through the park and say YOLO. All. The. Time.

Great title.

Total MILF.
I know y'all don't really care, but I'm just going to officially say here on a comment that this is my friend and not me. My friend's Facebook has been blowing up though from our friends recognizing him on the front page, and we even spotted this: http://imgur.com/Y8YdM
I see y'all are... dealing with it... pretty well. :)

The problem you may encounter with wearing patterned pants is playing them out. A good colored chino can do you some good... like maroon or dark green.
