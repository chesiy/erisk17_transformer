Storm of the Century
Lord of the Rings
Yes!
I wanna know too... I know the song is I Started A Joke, but who's it by is the question.
I think it's gonna be really good.
Titanic is my favorite movie.
Warcraft
In, The Village, when Bryce Dallas Howard is running through the house to get away from the monsters and the music is going, it's so beautiful.
James Cameron
It got a little too real for me at the end when they started talking about all these real world problems. It took me out of the movie and made me think about how shitty the world can be.   It also didn't take place in Tomorrowland. We saw Tomorrowland for maybe 5 minutes and the rest the film was elsewhere. I was kindof looking for an escape and that certainly wasn't it.
Only a few days away from Jurassic World.   I'm looking forward to reading some reviews tomorrow about it. I keep watching the trailers and TV spots. I'm just looking forward to the movie and seeing whether it's good or mediocre, I don't see it as being a horrible flop. What are people thinking about it now since it's only a couple days away? For those opposing it, if the reviews are good, would that change your mind about seeing it? For those excited about it, are you seeing it Thursday or over the weekend?
Titanic
Nooooo
The village
Of Monsters and Men
Personal, small (or large) things that happen to you in your life. Someone you run into after not seeing them for years at the right time and right place. Finding the exact perfect dress out of a million others in the store. The music moving with the birds flying over your car at the exact perfect moment in the song. Idk things. Unexplainable things. But I have no clue why bad things happen to good people, gods obviously not taking care of that stuff.
