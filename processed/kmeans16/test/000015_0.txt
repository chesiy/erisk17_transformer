I'm sure it's been talked about in the official forums and been commented on by one dev about making it aoe around the target, not sure tho i'll have a look for it!
Personally I love the name but I don't think they will change the name because they may have already used the name in the dialog of the story if the braham picking up eir's longbow idea comes true, they would have to get the voice actors back in and change it and that cost money and time which I'm sure a net don't want to spare right now with working on the expansion.
Reflects
As a level 52 you're at a major disadvantage, yes you get boosted to 80 but your stats will not be as high as an actual level 80 with full gear, you really have no chance until you're level 80 yourself and have your gear and traits, just run with the zerg try and stay out of the way and toss some grenades in there, also if you're getting chased Rocket Boots, turn around Net shot then run for your life and don't forget to use Caltrops on toolkit to slow them down and your block as you run away (If you think they can still hit you).
You've hit the nail on the head here i guess what it is that i'm most scared of was like you said the guy being better at this than i am, i feel like i would take that the wrong way and knock my confidence, it's not an easy decision to make, losing all control and allowing this to happen.  The part you explained about stepping back has really gave me a new perspective on how to look at it, thinking of it that way i don't get as angry as i would normally, i guess i picture myself in the point of view of the other guy and that's not the best thing to do.  I do need to work on my own insecurities and overthinking the situation and i think i can do it, you've helped me out more than you realise but i know i'm not going to change over night, but at least i have a new perspective to think about, thank you.

Lots of people i've talked to are reccomending this place, had a look myself it's looking like this might be the place!
Yeah I sent mine straight away as soon as I found out who my match was guess I'm just a little impatient and excited to see what I get!
Thanks I'll go have a look.
Thank you so much for sharing your experience, i'll show her this tomorrow and hopefully give her some peace of mind, i know it's going to be hard for her and i'm going to be there every step of the way with her, this is defenitly what we want we've spent alot of time thinking about it together, and yeah her family would go crazy if they knew about it and she doesn't need that extra stress, thank you again i'll show her this tomorrow (she doesn't use reddit) but she might PM you from my account if that's alright and again thank you so much!

My tits are plastic
Krave, always Krave.
If you have a ps3 you don't need ps plus to play online, only for ps4. Just to clarify.
