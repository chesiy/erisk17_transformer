It's just an interesting concept for me because I've never lived somewhere long term where my water wasn't as private as it got, ie: it came out of the ground the house was built on. And to make it better, no power = no water.  But I wouldn't trade it for anything.

I'm working here until they kick me off the campus. Do what you can, and don't let it kill ya
