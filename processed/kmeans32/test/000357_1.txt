Purchased a new shampoo and mousse, any other ideas for getting more volume?   Hi all, I have just purchased some John Frieda volumising shampoo and conditioner and some hair mousse. I have only tried it a few times, and had not much change so was wondering if anyone had any ideas onto a to create more volume in hair. My hair is bum length, red/Brown and never coloured before, it's quite dull and flat too.   Thanks :)
Thanks everyone. You've all really helped :)
Thanks all :)
If he's a sex god, then yes. 100%.
I quite like chest hair, and the snail trail under the belly button but cannot stand a hairy back!
Depression, relationships and drama.   I've been depressed for a very long time, and I've been with my boyfriend for quite a while now. It's been a a tough time, I won't deny that, it has not been easy and we often argue. Very recently, it's been amazing but last night I spent a few hours laying awake whilst he was dead to the world, and just looked at him and my mind was rattling on about how he should be with someone stable, someone he doesn't have to look after and deal with all the drama. I am actually worrying about whether I should let me go and be with someone 'normal'. I feel like I'm holding him back, and I know I need him, and am completely head over heels for him. I do try hard, but I don't know how much longer I can fool myself with thinking he's actually happy with someone like me.   I don't know what to do :(
I have a very balanced diet, but there is always room for more fruit and veg!:)   Thanks :)
In the shower, in my/his bed, we once tried on a wall outside his room but that was an epic fail. Lots of car sex too.

Do you hate me for letting the vet cut off your balls?
Your reply was pointless....
OH is other half...but thanks anyway
Make myself less depressed, and a lot more happy.
We've been together for longer than 3 months :) I understand how that may be annoying!
I have been doing this for a while, and started on FL. I have only bean to one munch, and realised it was not for me. I find people at munches to be a little too sociable than me and it did make me nervous. I stuck to meeting people one on one, because it was less overwhelming and I didn't feel under huge pressure. I'd say to just go to a couple, see how you feel and decide after that. A good London one to start with would be U35 weekend drinkies, or perhaps Camden crunch as they are pretty sociable and less shocking lol.   Don't worry about not being sexually experienced, most guys and girls there are newbies looking for a bit of advice and help on the scene. However don't feel you need to become a social butterfly, just because people on this site are. Do your own thing!  Watch out for safety on FL though, such a photos with your face in (if you are concerned about your career) and also, be wary of the usual posers and fakes! Always send out and ask for a personal photo perhaps with a sign with their username by their face or something.   Good luck!:)
Taking a break is good, but also staying around friends on FL is good. Choice is yours, maybe take some 'me time'
You're very welcome...good luck!
If you have nothing nice to say, please leave! I think the set looked lovely.
I didn't think there were many VS shops in UK either!
Where do you buy your lingerie from?   UK ladies, where do you buy your lingerie from?
Me [18 F] with my boyfriend [23M] we've been together for 6 months and I suck at doing what he wants e.g. threesomes.   We've been together for 6 months, nearly 7 and he is the most dominant man I've ever met. I find this hard, because I'm extremely opinionated and won't back down without a debate...it causes issues to say the least.   He likes to be dominant in the bedroom, which I'm fine with but now is slightly pushing too much at the idea of having a threesome. It's feeling a little to pressuring and I'm not sure what to do. How to I give him what he wants, without degrading myself or ruining the relationship. Also, how do I maintain a relationship with a guy who is obsessed with threesomes!!!        **tl;dr**: How do I make my guy see that I'm not going to back down to his every need? He is too dominant and I'm not submissive enough.
She only has a single bed, whereas I have a king size. Literally the only reason
I'm not lol! I'm Italian heritage...
