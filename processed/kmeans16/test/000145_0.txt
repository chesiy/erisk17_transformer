Thanks.
I have never actually comprised a portfolio, it's always been just a hobby for me. It's only lately I've decided to actually switch gears and move my life in this direction. Having said that, I will definitely take you seriously and will attempt to put something together. I should mention, I currently use a Rebel XSI, something I purchased in 2008, the camera that really sparked by attention. I am currently in the market for the Mark III, but am weighing my options against the Nikon 810A, I may wait it out for the new Canon line and focus on my education. Until then however, I feel I would be better represented by more experience with better equipment. Let me know what you think, and thanks.
That is fantastic to hear. Appreciate your input, thanks.
I feel the sound on the Between The Buried   Me: Live at the Fidelitorium bluray has the best sound of any concert bluray or dvd that I own.  I know it's not everyone's cup of tea, but it's so well done I had to make mention of it.  [Extremophile Elite](http://youtu.be/dM8WjgRA6o8)

Me too.
Haha, I've been there. It's funny to be a dick, even if no one else thinks so.
Please take my opinion lightly, but I've read your post and all the comments in it. It seems to me most of you are taking it all way too seriously, who gives a fuck? You're not going to change how other people perceive or feel about it, so why even bother. I'm with you on the matter but it's pointless to bring it up. Some people like things in a way that you don't, good lord better point it out, that'll teach them. Singling out the downfalls of others is pretty sophomoric in itself, why not make a post expressing your "insight" in a more constructive way? Why not tell us how Tool's music has affected you, changed you, or got you through a hard time, effectively removing the spot light from the "idols"? As for the comment here literally over analyzing the shit out of the whole thing, I've never read a more desperate attempt at trying to have Maynard personally login and and agree. Jesus H Christ people, it's music, of course the contributing artists will get credit equal to the greatness of the art. It's the exact same reason why many humans throughout history have become house hold names.
For those of you wanting to know:  * I took the picture with my phone because I wanted to quickly send it to my cousin and didn't want to go through the process on my phone.  * These are the "platinum" seats for Red Rocks using the "MYWAVE" Soundgarden fan club code.  * It is my personal opinion that no one is worth this much and that these are obviously reserved for the rich. (Unless of course there was some kind of meet and greet and/or sound check attendance which even then I wouldn't flip the bill)  * I can't see Trent agreeing to this after all he's stood up and said regarding corporations with hands in his pockets. What the actual fuck is going on here?
Preventing my 17 month old son from hitting, grabbing, and pulling hair.   Hello /r/parenting, I'm so glad I found you this past week. I can tell I have much to learn from you guys and I look forward to growing with you. Having said that, I am new to fatherhood with my 17 month old son, and his soon to be born baby sister. So far I am having a blast, with all the ups and downs, all I know is I wouldn't change it for the world and that this has been the best experience of my life so far.  The reason I come to you guys with this post is that currently my son has started to hit really hard, he has always had a thing for pulling my wife's hair, but now he's doing both to us. I really don't know how to react when he does this, should I be firm and tell him no? Or should we try not to draw any attention to it. So far I've been doing my best to make him understand that it hurts and that he shouldn't do it, but it's seemingly having no effect.  I'd really like to know how to deal with this especially before our little girl enters the situation and becomes another victim. Thank you so much for any help you can offer.
Although his/her answer was thorough and awesome, s/he did allude to Calgary being more of a white collar town, which is really not the case. Maybe on the surface it would appear that way, but there are many trades for one to get into. Even with only a high school diploma, you could definitely get your foot in the door as a pipe fitter and make a great living in a few years. Do you know people in either town or surrounding areas? That would be the biggest deciding factor for me.
I bet /r/horror would enjoy this, definitely cross post it over there. Good work, looks awesome.
Awesome brother! Glad it all worked out. Again sorry we got split up at the end. Enjoy the gold! Tell me what it does actually because I'd love to know haha.
I'm sick for mentioning it? Says the guy looking for something more shocking and "ate up" than the infamous "baby" scene of ASF. How depraved do your horror movies have to be before it's reality, this is the basic point I am making. There's a fine line between art and an obsession with death.
