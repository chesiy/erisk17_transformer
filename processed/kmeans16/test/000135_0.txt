Where did you hear that?
Oh yeah, duh! Thanks!
WELL DONE! No captions! :D
We're only hearing OP's side of the story.  Anyway, I must be lost because /r/pettyrevenge doesn't seem like the place to question the revenge that took place. It's more of a "yeah fuck that person" bandwagon.
Thankfully, yes. I was a sophomore in high school at the time. I graduated, went to college, and now have a stable job and a semi-stable life. A ton better than what it used to be.   Gosh, it doesn't feel that long ago. It's been more than six years. Woah. Time flies.
Me too. I pick my ears and smell the wax. I scratch my scalp and sniff. I'm fucking weird.
It sucks it always comes off dickish.   I just wanted to help out, he could be a non-native speaker.
Just to let you know:  I fucking hate Dr. Who AND 'How I met your mother'  The former is a cheap-ass show where every supporting actor fucking sucks at their job and the special effects are lame.  The latter because it's just not funny. Canned laughs all over the place and Ted is a fucking moronic character
I read it all and this is exactly how I feel about it.    When I didn't have the flair, I wanted it so bad and I got frustrated when people were getting in within a minute.    Now that I have it, I've stopped playing. I want others to have a shot at that glorious feeling that comes after acquiring such a difficult flair.
I don't know how to say this nicely:  Too bad. :D
Here is the recipe!    http://cavemanketo.com/crispy-wings/    If you're trying to cut back on fat, then baking would be best.  I'm on the keto diet so I'm just trying to limit my carb intake and let me tell you, I fry chicken thighs this way and I can't believe how crispy they turn out!
I don't get it, the first comment in the first link tells you exactly why it might have been deleted.   Keep your conspiracies out of our undeletes.  That's why they are two different subreddits.

[REQUEST][STEAM] Civ 5: Brave New World DLC   http://steamcommunity.com/id/jrockbarn  You know how it went on sale 2 days ago? Well this whole damn time I've owned the game I have just assumed I've had it. Until last night.  I play mulitplayer with some friends of mine and I try and join their game only to find out I don't actually have it and now it's $30 (a little ridiculous for a DLC if you ask me). If you have an extra copy from a bundle, i'd appreciate it.  I'll even draw something in mspaint for you if you comment (you don't have to give me the game for me to draw.)
Multiple-dial lock troubles.   At work we have [wall-mounted lock box](http://imgur.com/UEUElTj) where we store keys. It's always been open but yesterday I bumped up against it and closed it. Now it's locked shut and nobody knows the combination.  It's not your typical [multiple-dial lock](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Combination_discs.png), I've looked up youtube guides that tell people to look for markings under the turning dials and it doesn't have that. What I do see is [THIS](http://imgur.com/m3MtVjw). There is a flat surface on the cylinder below all three of the dials. I've tried lining them up facing me with no luck, I tried using the opposite number as well with no luck. I'm not even sure if that's the way I should be going in order to open it.  I need help opening this lock. Any help would be appreciated.
