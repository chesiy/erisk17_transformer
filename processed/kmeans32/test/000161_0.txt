I met this girl on DayZ, turns out she lived 30 miles away, skip ahead 3 years and i'm with the most beautiful amazing woman i've ever known and she's a firm believer of the PCMasterRace. I honestly think i might be the luckiest man alive for randomly meeting her online and living so close xD
there's no secret to gaining elo it's really just a case of working on what you already know like CS well, dont back when your mid laner is roaming (if you play mid that is), dont go for a kill unless you're 100% sure it'll be a success. It really is just a case of working on what you know and making small tweaks constantly. Oh and LOOK AT YOUR MAP MORE YOU DONT DO IT ENOUGH
Also for the record can we get a noise when lux's Q hits in fog of war? it's never made a noise and if it did it'd be an awesome quality of life change

After killing Meg in the Hyperion hub of Heroism, my friend and i got stuck in the hyperion store as the door wouldn't open. I had to eat my co-op partner :/
Yeah dude! Hence why i wanna know more about her! :D as for the hole in her, who's to know? Perhaps it was merely a robot. Her siren tattoos look more like circuitry/wires and she displays no siren ability when you fight her. Who's to say it was her at all and not just a robot? OOOOO CONSPIRACYYYYYYY! xD

Im sorry for your loss, i truly am :/ and yeah i agree the whole "it gets easier" shit people say is a bunch of bollocks, the highest suicide rates in america are white males above the age of 80 and people are saying it gets better!? That said I think you'll go far buddy, school was something i never did too well at, but keep studying hard if school is something you can deal with.
