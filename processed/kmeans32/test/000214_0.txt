Omigod. You're serious then! So what does this meat have in mind?"
Nya Sverige - U21 Hyllningsvideo
I'll make a vid tomorrow night when I get back to the countryside.  Here's some love from Sweden in the meanwhile.  [ABBA](https://youtu.be/uP0sC_s5EfE)  I'm pretty sure that when media gets that the next president of the united states (touch wood) have mentioned Sweden as well as other Scandinavian countries as models for healthcare and education it's gonna flood our news.  We are mighty proud of our healthcare system. And we love to hear the praise of it.
I'm sorry. That was a good comment you linked to. I didn't go that far back as to more than a *month back in time* But I still didn't see a post from you in this sub, and the few ones I saw on the subject of Bernie were strangely familiarly formulated not discussing any policy of his. Just broad key words like socialism, anti globalism, stagnated economy. Etc, etc.   I didn't accuse you in that sense. It's just there has been A LOT of fresh accounts coming here trying to cool things down. And when you didn't answer my question if you think Bernie has got enough name recognition but instead talked about how neutral you are  I began suspecting something was wrong. And I waited a good while before I said something about it.   I just thought that everyone agreed what Bernie's main concern is, is a certain other runner's name recognition that Bernie really lack. And found it weird you didn't think so.   Not everyone needs to be a vocal supporter. I don't think that.   I'm sorry if I offended you. I hope we can put our "pitchforks"  down and be civil. You seem like a good guy that stand up for what you believe. And hopefully we can end this discussion here on good terms because I really don't have time to do this anymore.
edit: So.  You think he get's enough name recognition?   Just to end my curiosity. How come, every comment you previously made about bernie make about him or any of his policies come across as completely neutral but seems to point towards pre ww2 politics, anti globalism and other short general expressions?? There is no positive feedback. Only subtle resent as I take it.   I'm just curious and you are free to explain this and we're done here.   Because we have different opinions and mine is.   The time to act, is now. Not later.
It's a publicly traded company. All they will EVER care about is showing a great profil for their shareholders. Every quarter. The streaming companies should fight for us, the consumers. Not the other way around.
I will not. But I will tell you. It's not getting any better for us. They announced the budget yesterday and no mention of higher taxes for wealthy..  Considering we have IKEA not having payed any taxes since I don't know when. The owner is worth about 61 Billion dollars..  Well. At least he don't make his money from oil. But it's still a shame. Also H M clothes use child labour in Bangladesh. And payed a total of about 60 dollars of taxes to Bangladesh a couple of years ago.. Pretty much two pair of pants.   So we have our own fair share of greedy billionairs.
EDIT: For some reason people seem to believe I'm a moron. To clarify. Of course the sun is a fusion reactor. I'm not retarded. And I just think that a building a fusion reactor here on earth is not only reaaaaaallly hard but also unnecessary because we already have one that's gonna hang around for about a couple of billion years. But hey. I know you want to educate people on science. I suggest you don't do it in the /r/science because here people actually know some things...  However we want to make "green energy" that is not nuclear. The energy is always gonna come from the sun. I am beginning to think Fusion Reactors is a red herring to keep us from beginning to invest in solar of various kind.

I'm just quoting those who mindlessly agree on something. If they really do think it is bullshit why not explain why they think that way? If I'm mission your point. Please do elaborate. I would like to understand you. And sorry if my english is bad. It's my second language.
Spank you very much
So it's you. The fun guy at parties.  Although the joke is on you. I would find it hard to swim down to the depths where the pressure is that high since i'm not an experienced diver.  Someone who knows the science may do the calculations.
Shiny cap'n. A-ok.
Regrettably I'm not.. She had a second secret email account on a separate private server whilst serving as Secretary of State. And that's a fact, easy to check out. Nothing mass-media likes to share very often. For obvious reasons.

I sent a Swedish translation. Go Bernie.
I find let's plays without narrating a bit pointless. But I understand, it's hard to find something to talk about and I think Scott Manley got it right with the "New me" and "Old me". That way you can put voiceover where you blabber about pointless things, say something stupid. Or such :)  Also, fastforward your launches. I get tired by just watching my own, again and again! ^^  Anpther tip is to do a better description. List your mods and stuff and do a short summery of what the episode is all about.   Otherwise I really liked the video and the creations.
*We'll have to wait and see!*
I knew it was coming so I have prepared an upvote for ya!
Well, yeah. It could be Benjen, Brandon, Ser Oswyll Kettleblack or what the hell.. It could be Moonboy for all we know.   But this added with the other 20 foreshadowings we have for R+L=J *I'm gonna take the liberty to place it in that file for now.*
(Spoilers All) The most obvious foreshadowing?   I am relistening to Clash of Kings, keeping an ear out for good foreshadowing. Some of them are pretty obvious once you know what's going on.  When Jon is about to chop Ygritte's head off George has planted some real obvious foreshadowing for R+L=J    nbsp;  *"He raised Longclaw over his head, both hands tight around the grip. One cut, with all my weight behind it. He could give her a quick clean death, at least. He was his fathers son. Wasnt he? Wasnt he?"*  **Two times?** That's bold of GRRM I would say. It should stand out, but it really don't if you aren't looking for it.   nbsp;  There's also one in A Storm of Swords where Sandor Clegane to Arya riding towards The Twins is also has a witty red wedding foreshadowing that is pretty well known   *"Keep your mouth shut and do as I tell you, and maybe well even be in time for your uncles bloody wedding.*   nbsp;  **Anyone else know a witty and/or really obvious foreshadowing that has or hasn't struck true yet?**
The big three. D or J i would guess.
(No Spoilers) Time to speculate about TWOW release again?   Why not. We have nothing better to do than wondering about how potatoes got to Westeros anyway.  New editions for A Song of Ice and Fire are releasing in October this year. Which could very well be Harper Voyagers way of cashing in inbetween the wait for the next big payday.  But I always keep a good look on GRRM's website. Particulary the tour-dates. http://www.georgerrmartin.com/appearances/ The next big convention is The Pacific Northwests Science-Fiction Fantasy Convention which almost coincides with the Season 5 premier date. And after that if follows with Fantasy conventions all year long.  **Let's speculate** Our dream would come true if GRRM announces this April with a summer/autumn release.   My more modest but still falthering hope is we have the book by Spring 2016, before season 6 starts.
Agree on Robert's rebellion.  However I don't feel Dunk and Egg is quite epic enough to make it to the big screen. It's still good drama though with a good climax in each story. As I mentioned in the OP, BBC's Sherlock has a quite fitting way of doing it. With 3 episodes per year each 1 and a half hour in length.   It could be awesome considering each novella is a separate story still connected to the other two.
Because Baelish says "I know, I know" in a certain way. Could be nothing though, but I made the thread because there are bound to be others I have missed, and someone has certainly picked one or two up.
First book is almost scene by scene. By the third book most things are changed, although they mostly arrive at the same point.  I know you are tempted to skip forward. Some of my friends have, and they have missed so much **You must bring yourself to read the books** though. You need to learn what Daenerys is thinking. Emilia Clarke doesn't portray her character as well as I wish she would. And Ned's chapters are gold. Just pure gold!  And of course what everyone already mentioned. All the prophecies, foreshadowing and backstory. First and second book as a lot of those. Particulary House of the Undying is very different from the show.
Oh yes! Ser Duncan the **Tall** probably the furthest you could come from a cripple, simple minded. Possibly Hodor's great-grandfather or something, making it more (somewhat more) believable for Bran to be able "warg" a person from history.   We also know he has interactions with BR.  More crackpot is that it may be revealed in the next book, and that's why Dunk and Egg 4 was postponed and replaced with The Princess and the Queen. Supposedly the next Dunk and Egg will take place in Winterfell/The North
Steal cars with Franklin
Trevligt :) Yeah I feel they catched most themes very well and I'm glad they didn't change any of the names.  Will probably watch every episode once they're all out.
I had a complete ship with batteries and solar panels, but when it didn't work the first time I made a new save file in sandbox to see if it was a technology problem. Didn't put that much effort into the test rocket.   The speed was probably due to "limit to terminal velocity".  Added stuff electrical stuff, and changed the turn shape a little.  New picture shows altitude at 62 000 km. past the node at 75 000 and now descending. Still not working. :(  http://imgur.com/GbtAZlt
Yeah, after the first try I thought it would be the electrical. But after 10 tries I am pretty sure it's not that...  http://imgur.com/pf2aLfG
