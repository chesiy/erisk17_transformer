Thanks for making 12Hours a hit, we are live with smart physical clock (soon crowdfunding)
I use Win 8.1 (came with win 7 - uh).  HDPI is fine, now using FullHD on 24" is a pain ( a bit joking but hell, you get addicted to hdpi). There is no many issues with hdpi - mainly scaling in not round way ( 100% is supper small, 150% is fine, but 123% for example is blurry in many place), some installers are a bit blurry but I hope with Win 10 it will be a bit better (also steam application is not hdpi-friendly). Probably HD on 14" is just enough but QHD is only version that was available here in Poland with i7.

I'm not sure if Drawer is correct UX pattern in "wizard", as (in most cases) we don't want user to jump from first to last item without setting middle ones.  Just a thought.

Best car racing moments from Poland (2014)
You didn't specify layout, as I'm a TKL guy...  CoolMaster Quickfire Rapid - good, "standard", cheap (one of cheapest), and same manufacture as Filco.  Other than that - Leopold 660M, to Europe is one of cheapest options if you like such layout. So which keyboard is "the cheapest" depends on that where you live.  For example in Poland SteelSeries is one of cheapest (90$), and next is Razer BW Tournament (120$). In Europe you should also check Das Keyboard as it might be good option to go.
Did you updated from previous version? If yes please reinstall - for some people it was solution, however I tested and didn't notice it. If not please mail me(mail is in the app), describe step by step what you do and where it fails, also please specify details of phone/system. **I would appreciate all of people who have such issue to do that** - as I would love to solve it but it is as a riddle because on my 5 test phone everything is ok.

If you have any questions just ask.
Twins? (FIXED)
I find **Monsters** (2010) surprisingly good.   [SPOILER - which make whole film a top notch]  First and last scene are the same (with military troops) - mind blowing.
Sorry, but Android doesn't give a list of alarms, also timely doesn't.
Will look into that but please don't get your hopes up, as there is very little chance that it would work - but I will try! Reddit made my widget popular, so I own you guys.
Yes, it have to be in next 12 hours, and it have to be a "not all day one". Also it refreshes every 30minutes so if you add one in meantime, wait 30min. or remove and add calendar to force update.
Thank you! You are very helpful sir. Will take look at that and add it if it works.
It is known (to me) bug - apart for you nobody found it. So ssssshhh... *they don't know*.  [Serious] I'm working on it.
Sorry for copypasta but it is post up: "Do you feel lucky? You should, it is already uploaded - give it 1-2hours to distribute to your local servers. It has 2x2 and 3x3 ones."
In upcoming days I will add a feature to add own colors, and a checkbox "use calendar color" so please stay tuned.  About that colored area whre you don't have anything - double check if for sure you don't have - maybe a hidden event?
Sorry to disappoint you, but no. It is one year old idea, but there was always something more important to do, and I wasn't convinced that it would be so successful.  But it is nice to see that not only I have cool ideas, even if very similar.

I lost hope that it will be finally out, nice but somehow I enjoyed more 1,2, or 3 parts.
Some story behind that gif: It was during EURO 2012 in Warsaw - when hosts (Poland) was playing with England - game was postponed. But there is a roof which (even despite that forecast was saying that it is going to rain) was left open. As a result of waiting for the game, two guys run on pitch - they were arrested, but later on (as I remember correctly) their charges were withdrawn.
