I think the rule should be "Your image should be funny without having to read the text in you [fucking] title."  Bracketed words optional.  Seriously. I click on so many things that happen to be in /r/funny. And a lot of times I get some crap that doesn't make sense until I read or re-read the title. If it isn't funny without the title, don't post it.
1. You don't have any historical feedback. Historical feedback is NOT feedback from previous threads. That should be labeled as Previous Thread.  2. That thread is archived. Leave a link when you make a new one.
I imagine that the mods of /r/Yu-Gi-Oh! Work a lot harder than I do. I don't care so much about the thanks. I run the subs that I do because I love the game. I'm asking everyone to thank the main mods not me. If I didn't already look like an ass, here's a news flash. Go fuck yourself. I don't mod this sub, therefor I'm not asking for thank yous. I'm asking that everyone make sure /r/Yugioh has mods that don't go underappreciated.
In Nintendo's Defense, anything before the Wii wasn't a gimmick with controls. DS seemed like pure gimmick, but it something that definitely works when executed correctly. So I wouldn't can that just another Gimmick. And let's be glad the 3DS isn't just a DSi with a 3D screen, but a very competent handheld with extremely fun games to play. Yeah, yeah, low res, whatever, still way too much fun on one handheld.
"Mmm" *rolls over and opens eyes* "COLLIN?!?"
So, some people are starting to maybe come to there senses. Seriously, this mass surveillance is a waste of money, a waste of time, and an overload of useless data that buries anything that could actually be used.  They can't give us that bullshit about how stopping this means we're stopping the spying on known terrorists and criminals. If they were *known* terrorists and criminals, then wouldn't we have a warrant for their arrest and their asses in jail?
I have a good bulk of what you're looking to buy. I had a Cyber Dragon deck I used to play. I took out some of the more common cards to use in another deck, so I can sell you what I have at a price that's more than reasonable. Finances are forcing me to take a hiatus, so let's make a deal. PM me if you're interested and I'll get you a list and pics of what I have.
"If ye believe in sooth that left Twix be superior, then HAVE AT YE."
They really are desperate to keep their tyrannic choke hold on the necks and wallets of consumers. Seriously, saying "we can't change the new rules, so let's try to make sure nobody can enforce them" is basically saying "We know we're doing shit they wouldn't like and that consumers don't like, but we're hoping we can keep them stupid until we're retired with lots of their money in our pockets."  Fuck you Pai. Fuck you internet providers. Fuck everyone involved in letting the internet situation get as bad as it did. For fuck's sake, don't tell  us this bullshit how you need more money and tax cuts and that you can't innovate unless you're a fucking monopoly. There are service providers in other countries half as old as you are offering fiber speeds for dirt cheap compared to here and they're all doing just fine. And once the rest of America figures that out, they're gonna rip you a fucking new one.
I probably would. There would probably be a lot of decks that would benefit from something like this. Plus, it would obsolete all normal monsters with 5 or more stars with less than that much attack. I.E. Red-eyes Black Dragon.
So... if this was able to support the off-brand 3rd party ones, the ones that try to look like the official one, that would be great. I tried just to see if it would work with my girlfriend's adapter. (Her parents did the buying, which was a stupid decision since they don't have a fucking clue when it comes to electronics.)
Then why don't you do a bit of help and actually report spam? As a new mod, I'll be on from time to time to make sure any shit that isn't actually vine related is removed. And we're not trying to be all funny vines. We are trying to promote all areas of vine.
"I'm sorry sis, but when you don't open your legs, something's gotta give."
"Our Drew carey which art behind the desk.  Huge be your fat ass."
Yeah. I do. Funny you should reply today. I was about to post an update.
I'm not planning to just do dittos. That'd be fucking retarded. Even if we did do dittos, it's obvious that you can't just play it like other match-ups. I want to ruin people's day against their other characters.
Ocarina of Time? Try a bit of Majora's Mask. Pretty much the only things we seem to be unable to figure out is skipping New Wave Bassa Nova and Song of Awakening, or warping straight to the moon.  But, by God does the infinite sword glitch simply break that game. It does that by making Bomb hovering possible. In case anybody doesn't know, bomb hovering is possible in Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask by the way the sword functions. Link cannot fall or slip off an edge if his sword's hitboxes are active, so infinite sword glitch combined with block an explosion in the air will cause link to hover. You get off the air by back flipping.  This allows for stupidly crazy stuff.
I got my girlfriend a preorder of that the year it was announced. I guess I'm better! Lol. That's great for you. It's a good read. Hope you enjoy.
The point rather wasn't that the 1,000 LP isn't too far is it isn't too much. What monster are you honestly going to take? Tellarknights wouldn't benefit from anything other than a level 4. BA? Level 3. If you're planning to take a tuner and just sync for whatever, you're going to need a varied extra deck to take advantage of the multiple levels you might take control of.  In the end, Snatch steel is still one card from your hand. If your opponent MSTs it, then it's a 1 for 1. If you take your opponent's monster and tribute it, it's a 1 for 1. Stronger duelists don't settle for something that not only requires set-up but is a 1 for 1 at its strongest. If you could get YOUR OWN monster on the field for virtually free (ala graveyard effect or effect of a monster on field, whatever it is) then you've pretty much got something better than snatch steel. In that set-up, not only have you put a monster there, but an MST isn't an out to it in most cases. Furthermore, it will be your monster whose effect you can take advantage of.  In a format where Snatch Steel is in your main deck, you better hope your opponent's monsters have generic ignition effects that you can take advantage of to turn Snatch Steel into more than a 1 for 1. Hoban pretty much has it right. No deck should be relying on Snatch Steel as an explosive strategy. Especially in a format where the monsters vary greatly in level. Not to mention, when you take your opponent's monster and put it in the graveyard, you better consider the potential downside you could be giving your opponent. You'd be taking something worse than a 1 for 1 if you took a Burning Abyss monster and tributed it for something. Even if you Xyz with it, later, it *will* hit the graveyard and boost your opponent's position.  So quite honestly, this isn't a "make me win" card. It's a "win slightly more" card in some matchups and a "definite side-out" in other match-ups. A card like that won't be in a high-level player's main deck. And I'm calling right now that running Snatch Steel at all for tournaments is going to be the minority. (And no, I don't mean local tournaments where everyone will ride whatever hype train Yu-Gi-Oh! is on. Significant tournaments.)
Nope.
I got it. You fucking prick. I knew what you meant. I thought the joke was just telling me I should get my wording right. Now fuck off.
My family still assumes that I'm as immature as a 6-year old. That started when my girlfriend gave me a rainbow-dash shirt during my first Christmas as a brony. They couldn't believe that I would watch the show. They've never seen it, and have never given it a chance because of their impressions on the previous renditions of the franchise. To make it worse, my eldest brother sees it as *another* reason to call me gay. My mom continues to question my interest and sexuality and taste in shows because my oldest sister watched three minutes of generation 1 and gave up on it.  It's bucking annoying. In my family, you can joke about killing each other, beat each other up, give gag gifts, and even watch extremely violent and/or satanic shows for a laugh. But watch an episode of My Little Pony and everyone starts questioning everything about you.  My girlfriend's family is a lot more accepting it, and every day, I like start to like them more than my own family. Not all of my girlfriend's family doesn't all watch, but they are much more understanding of why we like the show.  I can handle some stranger on the internet or passer-by assuming I masturbate to cattle or horses, but my family simply not giving it a chance or hearing me out on why I like it just makes me wish I had a different family.  I don't necessarily watch The Walking Dead, Game of Thrones, Glee, or Breaking Bad. But my family spans all of those and I at least respect them. I don't call my sister a geek or loser or assume she's a talent-less wannabe for watching Glee, nor do I think my eldest brother is a meth-head or accuse him of being a marijuana junkie for watching Breaking Bad. But I respect what they watch.  I'll be glad once I get my own place, since then I'll finally be surrounded by fellow bronies.  (Wow, I just realized that Bronies act more accepting than my fully Christian family. Seriously, the only family I can think of that hasn't been judgmental about it is my brother-in-law who is a pastor.)
"I can get it for five dollars at Franks".   -ultra rare breakthrough skill.  "sorry, it's getting hit for sure,".   -Evils warm Option  "that's not for trade ".   -a card they really should not put in their binder if they are not trading it  "you have any (insert card I have)".   -"oh, I'm sorry, I'm only looking for the ultimate rare"  "yugioh prices is always wrong".   -their other site's prove ends up benefiting me instead of him, so I just let it go.  Just to elaborate, I was willing to value my exciting at 20. Based on yugioh prices. He saw 30 dollars for the same exciton and offered me 25 for it. I took his offer.  Also, please fucking learn how to use Yugioh Prices. It checks everything at once for you. If a value seems unusual, click on the fucking listing and verify it.
From my own comment:   Let me just start off that nobody will be constantly clicking links for a full 30 month day. Take into account that we spend 1/3 of our lives asleep. That's shortens it to 20 days (480 hours, 28,800 minutes, 1,728,000 seconds) which accounts for 10.8 million megabytes. That's about 10,800 Gigabytes. Now, if that's from one device from one person who also spends half of his awake time away at a job, that cuts it to 5,400GB. Now let's say he only spends half of his home time clicking links (and keeping the line busy). That's down to 2,700GB. I've cut it time after time after time.   Shoot, far over the 300GB cap that Comcast insists that we will love and I've made some generous deductions. And, by OP's overage fees, that's 48 fees equating to $480 just to use internet how we've always been using it.  Assuming sleep time and a 9-5 job, that's 8 hours at home using the network. We'll also assume it's in constant use at full potential. That's 1,440,000 megabits per day, divide by 8 for megabytes which is 180,000 megabytes per day. Multiply that by 30 days for 5.4 million megabytes or 5,400 gigabytes. That's 18x the cap that Comcasts assume you'll love. I could understand a 5,000 gigabyte cap, but not a miserable 300.
I'm hoping they can fix a problem I'm having. Every time I open Safari or Youtube, it feels the need to tell me that Cellular data cannot be used with the app and I can change it in settings. Even if I'm on Wifi, it feels the f *(ing need to tell me this. And I don't have the option to turn these alerts off.  If anyone knows what I'm talking about, make sure to log this complaint as well.
Yes it is. It was pretty much doomed to be that way. This is the first mobile OS apple made that allowed apps to talk to each other and use each other. Not to mention, they just added so darn much to the inner workings of this thing. And it pretty much supported more devices than any iOS before it. Especially all of the features that are dependent on communication with other apps and/or devices.  Yeah, I'm a little down that safari crashes more often that it used to (not like I should be browsing that much on my phone anyway). I'm also a little bummed that airplay or airdrop simply don't see other devices with these enabled sometimes. Such a shame. I'm also disappointed that the wifi simply cuts out sometimes in places where it didn't before iOS 8.  Nevertheless, the least we can do to help is go to Apple's feedback page and leave feeedback. Don't sit here complaining fruitlessly if you have an issue. Report everything to Apple. They need to hear the same complaints over and over from different users so they know that each issue IS an actual issue.
[Fic] IAmA -Recent college graduate and motivational speaker. My mom recently passed away, my girlfriend broke up with me, and my best friend is moving across the country. Did I mention I have a back problem that prevents me from standing up straight?- AMA   My name is Blaine. Well, I have my next motivation speech in just a few days and I honestly don't know how I'm going to handle it. I want to just dump the script and leave all my thoughts and feelings on random strangers, but I'm not sure what good that will do.  My mom passed away about a month ago leaving half of her money and property to me and the other half to my younger sister. I gave half of my half to my younger sister since she definitely needs it more than I do. I thought that before my ex-girlfriend, Winter, broke up with me a week later. She says she didn't fall out of love with me, but that she realized she only ever loved what I did for her.  My friend Luke just broke up with his girlfriend too. Although, for them, it was a clean break. They agreed that they were going different ways and decided to break it off. And now, he's moving to New York to seek a career playing brass instruments live for plays. Good for him.  I would have started this AMA sooner had I not been in tears last night. I was simply too emotional to care.  I hope I don't look like I'm dumping my entire agenda on you. I just need to get out these feelings so they don't come out during my job.

[Announcement] I migrated my name. It's me, Rifall, the founder of /r/ygosales. My new name is test_subject1372.   I made a new account since my Rifall nickname is wearing off. My friends call me reiden, and Rifall is getting hard to remember, and it's no fun to keep correcting people on the pronounciation. I even have friends who call me refill.  I'll still be here moderating. Just with a new name.
