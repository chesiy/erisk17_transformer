It's economy law  - you couldn't expect to take too much for a product above its cost and not loosing  your share of the market. This is how open source had happen.

Tiles interface had it's go with win8 and failed - it's just like to change one day law and ask drivers to drive on the left hand side of the road (or opposite if you in UK). Seams to me new CEO understand why open source happened and this is really good even for open source  ;-)
