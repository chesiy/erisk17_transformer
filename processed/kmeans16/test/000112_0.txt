What's your favourite Indian snack saar?
The Bangladesh team have incredible momentum on their side.
It's a tough call. I'd say Laloo holds the edge but Kejri is sure growing in chutiyapa by the month
Rahul Gandhi
Yeah, why can't he just wear clothes made of old curtains and shit in a bucket like all the other world leaders.

I just want to say that you'll be ok   I think it's been a year since I broke up with my ex-gf. I have a tattoo of her name on my body which I intend to remove as soon as I get my finances right. It was a bad decision to get it in the first place, but...eh...mistakes happen.   I have suffered a lot in the past few months. But having no contact with my ex has helped me a lot in moving on. It would have been even better had she not messaged me at all. She used to message me like once a week or something and I could see the display pic of her hugging her new boyfriend. She moved on very quickly after we broke up. That fact tormented me a lot.  Anyway, I'm in a better mental state now and it's been a life changing experience. I just want to say that if you're suffering right now then, just know that it will end one day and you will be able to breathe.   There will come a day when you won't wake up in the morning with the thought of your ex in your head and the memories will begin to fade away. Just hang in there. Also if you focus on reading and some outdoor activities, it'll just help more.   Both good times and bad times end one day.
1. Astronomy - I recently joined the amature astronomers club in my city and it's been an amazing experience to say the least. I am still a newbie so I hardly know much but I think my passion is only going to grow.  1. Reading - before my last break-up I used to read a lot, but my ex-gf used to devour most of my time and then by the last few months of the relationship she turned into one  of those "crying" manipulative women. Rediscovering my love for reading has been one of the best thing I have ever done. I recently finished Brave New World and right now I'm reading Crime and Punishment by Dostoyevsky.  3. Cricket - I love Cricket. The Ashes will begin soon and I can't wait.   4. Gaming - I like playing Civilization 5 whenever I find time. It's the best game I ever played.  5. Learning to play the Harmonica. I bought a diatonic harmonica a month ago and I spend around 30 minutes everyday practicing it. It'll take a lot of time before I learn to play my favourite songs, but the investment will be worth it.

Bro, dropping 30 places in the list of the most corrupt countries is kinda of a small achievement. I don't think you should start with that sentence if you are trying to highlight the rampant growing corruption in India
Probably not in the coming decade. Maybe after that.   But in a way it is good as we will be able to see how this plays out in countries like U.S and learn from their mistakes/exleriences after 10 years.
