Your links aren't internationally accessible nor specific and I don't think those videos are  there .  People harping on about official videos will destroy the discussion on this small subreddit.  This subreddit does a lot of good for creating the hype that encourages people to watch the show live when they can.  It really doesn't matter what the source of the clips are.  As you can tell, I am more bothered about content contributors being hounded  or worrying too much about their sources.  For what its worth,   the OP here has posted links to the official youtube channel of the battlebots creators .
/r/battlebots is for fans of robot combat and all forms of competitive robotics.  It isn't tied to the television show.  People are already welcome to post whatever they want here whether it is robotwars, drone racing of conceptual ideas/art.    Any suggestions to help make that more obvious are welcome.  I think we will drop the header image soon and more of the branding that ties to the show once it is over (or even sooner if anyone can help make some nice graphics).
Nearly any program can be justified 'in the name of security', but how much privacy and how many freedoms are you willing to trade 'in the name of security'. This single decision will not end the debate, so expect to deal with it as the digital age matures and becomes more deeply integrated into every facet of our lives. Think well now what decision you make lest you come to regret it later.
Net neutrality fundamentalism isn't always a good thing straight away.  I feel that they could return to the question of net neutrality 10 years down the line when they have infrastructure and everyone online
Facebooks Internet.org sees defections over alleged harm to net neutrality. App to get impoverished online gives free access, but only to select websites.
As long as its framed as reasonable network management." I dislike the vague and undefined nature of "reasonable". To them, reasonable, in terms of the legality of file-sharing would be zero file-sharing, right?  The FCC is smart enough to know it would be difficult to force ISPs to take action by law in terms of demanding that they willfully damage their own business, so now expect to see pressure steadily applied to the ISPs, so they voluntarily choose to "do the right thing".  We have already witnessed the MPAA abusing any law that helps them shut down piracy and I see these loopholes in net neutrality being heavily abused by the MPAA as soon as they can get started on that.  Sure, Net Neutrality does have its good points, but doesn't feel like its good for our way of doing things. The main problem has always been their continued failure to see downloads and lost sales as two quite different things and so they pursue file-sharing doggedly to ensure that we rush out and buy their products. Frankly, if TV broadcasting was better and not full of shows for dumb people and as many commercial breaks as they can squeeze in - I wouldn't even need to download.  I also dislike their notion that you are not entitled to your privacy, unless you're willing to pay for a service to ensure you get privacy.   Reasonable Network Management needs to be explicitly defined such as the ability to counter a DDoS attack. Throttling unlimited data customers on mobile networks because you want to get more money from them or using man in the middle attacks on BitTorrent traffic have been the result of the vague reasonable network management definition.   But at the end of the day, it is weird to even suggest that the economy revolve around "hollywood".  Since when did that happen.  Basically the article  says that all innovation and technology that could be disruptive (outside of their ownership) can be considered illegal. It took labels TEN years to consider digital files as "legitimate". Independent content is never "legitimate". They always consider streaming services as "illegitimate". Every new technology has this hurdle and it's just been given the go ahead.  And penalties for abuse?  This copyright loophole is an end run that invalidates everything net neutrality was intended to do. It's useless.  There is nothing to increase competition. Nothing to reduce rates. Nothing that will immediately speed things up or increase service. Nothing that an average person can use to fight bad behavior or abuse of DMCA (which is more likely than pirating). Nothing to repair damage when whole domains are blocked erroneously. Now they approve of blocking technology. What did "we" win?

My gut reaction would be that image processing could compensate.    Quick search and I see Apple has a patent http://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2013/12/apple-patent-reveals-oculus-rift-like-headset-for-short-sighted-viewers/  You would think that this would be a big selling point.  Maybe that will be a 2nd generation.
In a new report, Europe says mass surveillance threatens human rights
British and Canadian spy agencies accumulated sensitive data on smartphone users, including location, app preferences, and unique device identifiers, by piggybacking on ubiquitous software from advertising and analytics companies, according to a document obtained by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden.
Why You Must Care That The FCC Is Attempting To Redefine Broadband. In the wake of the ongoing net neutrality argument, an additional equally significant squabble between regulators and telecoms businesses has been overlooked.
That is the first time I read that argument as I hardly follow this issue.  Sounds plausible.  Thanks for presenting it in a way that won't be buried by cynics
It would be wonderful if Comcast did pursue someone trying to make customer service complaints public.   Just think of the negative reaction on reddit and elsewhere and how it would unite people on behalf of the victim.    I think if the privacy of the customer agents is respected ... i.e. leaving out their name, then there is no good reason for Comcast to try and use the small words of a contract against you.  then again, they are evil
The U.S. is Urged to Honestly Apologize to Mankind for Its Evil Doing before Groundlessly Pulling up Others      Strange thing that happened in the heart of the U.S., the ill-famed cesspool of injustice, is now afloat in the world as shocking news.  The Sony Pictures Entertainment, the biggest movie producer in the U.S., which produced the undesirable reactionary film "The Interview" daring hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK and agitating even terrorism and had a plan to distribute it, was exposed to surprisingly sophisticated, destructive and threatening cyber warfare and has been thrown into a bottomless quagmire after suffering property losses worth hundreds of millions of dollars.  The public in the U.S. is now describing this case as "disgrace suffered by Sony Pictures Entertainment," "very sorry thing caused by the U.S.," "Sony Pictures Entertainment showing a white flag before hackers" and the "unprecedented disaster suffered by the U.S."  Those who meted out a stern punishment of justice were reported to be cyber experts styling themselves "guardians of peace".  Seized with terrible horror and threat in face of their merciless hacking attack in retaliation against unjust actions, many movie and drama distributors in North America including 41 states of the U.S. and Canada immediately canceled the screening of the reactionary movie. And it was reported that the Sony Pictures Entertainment which directly sponsored its production and distribution hastily issued a statement on Dec. 25 that it would suspend the screening of the undesirable movie which had been planned in 63 countries.  The NDC of the DPRK highly estimates the righteous action taken by the "guardians of peace," though it is not aware of their residence.  It, at the same time, considers as fortunate the step taken by the Sony Pictures Entertainment to give up the overall distribution of the above-said movie due to the decision and strong pressure of the movie and drama distributors for stopping the screening of the reactionary movie, though belatedly.  This is an official stand of the army and the people of the DPRK on what happened in the heart of the U.S.  This stand is taken by the DPRK because the movie "The Interview" is an undesirable and reactionary one justifying and inciting terrorism which should not be allowed in any country and any region.  Another reason is that the movie is run through with a story agitating a vicious and dastardly method of assassinating a head of a legitimate sovereign state.  No wonder, even political and social circles of the U.S. commented that it is quite wrong to defame the head of the state for the mere reason that his politics is different from that of the U.S. and it is in the hostile relationship with the latter and, therefore, the Sony Pictures Entertainment got into a serious trouble and paid a due price.  For these reasons, the DPRK is more highly praising the "guardians of peace" for their righteous deed which prevented in advance the evil cycle of retaliation-- terrorism sparks terrorism.  It is quite natural that the movie and drama producers should refrain from undesirable deeds contrary to the noble mission to lead morality and civilization.  But what matters is that the U.S. and its followers are groundlessly trumpeting that the recent cyber attack was made by the DPRK.  The FBI issued the results of the investigation into the hack at the Sony Pictures Entertainment on December 19.  According to them, it suffered tremendous losses.  One may say this is the due price incurred by wrong deed, the evil act of hurting others.  The U.S. released a statement asserting that this loss was caused by the DPRK.  No matter how big and disgraceful the loss may be, the U.S. should not pull up others for no reason.  The FBI presented a report on the results of technical analysis of hacking program used by the "guardians of peace" for this attack, citing it as the ground that the serious hacking was caused by the DPRK.  The report says the malignant code had access to north Korea's IP already known several times and the hacking methods applied in the "March 20 hacking case" and during cyber warfare against media and various other computer networks in south Korea in recent years are similar to that applied against the Sony Pictures Entertainment this time, being another ground that "this was done by the north".  The report, in particular, adds that the malignant code and algorithm applied during the attack are similar to what was used during the hacking attack on south Korea, citing it as a proof.  Not satisfied with those groundless "evidence", the FBI is letting loose ambiguous remarks that it is hard to fully prove due to the "protection of sensitive information sources."  This means self-acknowledgement that the "assertion about the north's deed" came from an intentional allegation rather than scientific evidence.  It is a common sense that the method of cyber warfare is almost similar worldwide. Different sorts of hacking programs and codes are used in cyberspace.  If somebody used U.S.-made hacking programs and codes and applied their instruction or encoding method, perhaps, the "wise" FBI, too, could not but admit that it would be hard to decisively assert that the attack was done by the U.S.  Moreover, the DPRK has never attempted nor made a "cyber-attack" on south Korea. The rumor about "cyber-attack" by the DPRK was a concoction made by the south Korean puppet regime and its plot.  After all, the grounds cited by the FBI in its announcement were all based on obscure sci-tech data and false story and, accordingly, the announcement itself is another fabrication. This is the DPRK's stand on the U.S. gangster-like behavior against it.  What is grave is that U.S. President Obama is recklessly making the rumor about "DPRK's cyber-attack on Sony Pictures" a fait accompli while crying out for symmetric counteraction, strict calculation and additionally retaliatory sanctions.  This is like beating air after being hit hard. A saying goes every sin brings its punishment with it. It is best for the guilty to repent of its evil doings and draw a lesson when forced to pay dearly for them.  The DPRK has clear evidence that the U.S. administration was deeply involved in the making of such dishonest reactionary movie.  It is said that the movie was conceived and produced according to the "guidelines" of the U.S. authorities who contended that such movies hurting the dignity of the DPRK supreme leadership and inciting terrorism against it would be used in an effective way as "propaganda against north Korea".  The U.S. Department of State's special human rights envoy went the lengths of urging the movie makers to keep all scenes insulting the dignity of the DPRK supreme leadership in the movie, saying it is needed to "vex the north Korean government".  The facts glaringly show that the U.S. is the chief culprit of terrorism as it has loudly called for combating terrorism everywhere in the world but schemed behind the scene to produce and distribute movies inciting it in various countries of the world.  It is not exaggeration to say in the light of the prevailing situation that the U.S. administration and President Obama looking after the overall state affairs of the U.S. have been behind the case.  Can he really cover up the crimes he has committed by trying so hard to falsify the truth and turn white to black.  So we watched with unusual attention what had been done by the "guardians of peace" to avert terrorism and defend justice.  Yet, we do not know who or where they are but we can surely say that they are supporters and sympathizers with the DPRK.  The army and people of the DPRK who aspire after justice and truth and value conscience have hundreds of millions of supporters and sympathizers, known or unknown, who have turned out in the sacred war against terrorism and the U.S. imperialists, the chieftain of aggression, to accomplish the just cause.  Obama personally declared in public the "symmetric counteraction", a disgraceful behavior.  There is no need to guess what kind of thing the "symmetric counteraction" is like but the army and people of the DPRK will never be browbeaten by such a thing.  The DPRK has already launched the toughest counteraction. Nothing is more serious miscalculation than guessing that just a single movie production company is the target of this counteraction. Our target is all the citadels of the U.S. imperialists who earned the bitterest grudge of all Koreans.  The army and people of the DPRK are fully ready to stand in confrontation with the U.S. in all war spaces including cyber warfare space to blow up those citadels.  Our toughest counteraction will be boldly taken against the White House, the Pentagon and the whole U.S. mainland, the cesspool of terrorism, by far surpassing the "symmetric counteraction" declared by Obama.  This is the invariable toughest stand of the army and people of the DPRK.  Fighters for justice including "guardians of peace" who turned out in the sacred drive for cooperation in the fight against the U.S. to defend human justice and conscience and to dismember the U.S. imperialists, the root cause of all sorts of evils and kingpin of injustice, are sharpening bayonets not only in the U.S. mainland but in all other parts of the world.  The just struggle to be waged by them across the world will bring achievements thousands of times greater than the hacking attack on the Sony Pictures Entertainment.  It is the truth and inevitability of the historical development that justice prevails over injustice.  Whoever challenges justice by toeing the line of the biggest criminal U.S. will never be able to escape merciless punishment as it is the target of the sacred drive for cooperation in the fight against the U.S.  The U.S. should reflect on its evil doings that put itself in such a trouble, apologize to the Koreans and other people of the world and should not dare pull up others.
"war by oil" - The US and Saudi Arabia are colluding to keep production artificially high in a bid to drive the price down. The net result has been to make life difficult for Russia and Iran   Vladimir Putin has blamed the west for the current crisis, and hes not alone. While locals have likened it to an economic war, some western commentators agree. Earlier this year, back when oil was still at around $88 a barrel, New York Times columnist Thomas L. Friedman pointed the finger squarely at the US for the collapse. Widely accepted in Russia, is that the US and Saudi Arabia are colluding to keep production artificially high in a bid to drive the price down. The net result has been to make life difficult for Russia and Iran, at a time when Saudi Arabia and America are confronting both of them in a proxy war in Syria, he wrote. This is business, but it also has the feel of war by other means: oil.  **Just as they did to the last leaders of the Soviet Union, the Americans and Saudis are trying to pump them to  death**  http://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/pump-them-to-death-the-secret-war-on-russia/story-e6frflo9-1227160860899
