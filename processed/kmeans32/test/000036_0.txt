Put contact info in your bio (your email, and email that you create, don't matter it's up to you). I bet you'll be approached to sell that, especially if you make it easy with the contact info. I'm not sure for other countries, but as you probably know it's common practice to get paid for good usernames, even tho it's against the TOS. It happens though, and if your name is the name of the show, then I'd hold tight. Maybe try opening a different account for your personal stuff, now.
This is really, close, but my grandma says it's not the movie. I added more details in my description. Thanks so much for helping!

I will say this: I have seen, and even studied, their ads numerous, numerous times. After seeing your post, I finally just became a member. They should pay you.

I just recently left in Feb. But I know a lot about the interviews and how recruiters think.  Like a previous poster said, smile. Always smile. Don't talk about how much you love Disneyland. They don't care who your favorite character is or how many times you've been. When they ask you your number one concern, it is ALWAYS safety. Think about how the four keys of Disneyland (Safety, Courtesy, Show, Efficiency) affect your role and answer the questions in that way. You're not supposed to know those keys right now so don't talk about knowing them but casually mentioning them would be prime (i.e. "I recognize that to be a great CM, I have to be courteous to all guests when performing my role." That's another one: don't forget to think of yourself when answering questions as a part of a show, a cast member with a role.  That's about it. They typically offer the jobs on the spot if they like you.  Good luck. Say hi to the Mouse for me.

Thanks so much!
Okay, we get it. You're funny. Please make this AMA worth something to us by giving us real answers to our questions, please.
Wow. I'm extremely humbled by this. That's my tweet. I started posting my tweets in Nov to get feedback on my jokes and reddit has been very kind to me. Seeing someone else post my own tweets is so crazy.  To clarify, I work at Disneyland and teenagers run rampant through the park and say YOLO. All. The. Time.
[Here's his reply](http://i.imgur.com/rKDui.jpg)  I then replied with http://i.imgur.com/ckuY7.gif  Thanks again Reddit.
Chapman actually.
Those Mexican Microwaves....
Look... closelier....
Thanks for sharing. I'll be right there with you once I get out of this school, man.
That's a really funny video! Thank you for sharing, or else I would never have seen it. Looks like I wasn't the first to have this idea... but what ideas are ever original to us?  Hahaha, getting way too fucking lofty at 4:45AM....
This is something a lot of parents should be doing all the time that my mother did for me: My mom is a very popular lady amongst her peers and at her workplace. So, whenever she would take me around her friends, family members I hadn't met yet, or people she ran into at the store, she'd always make sure I fully introduced myself and started even just some small talk with the person(s). Instead of "This is my son Michael" she'd turn to me and say "Michael, would you like to introduce yourself?" Really simple. I'd generally reply with "Hi, it's nice to meet you. I'm Michael. Shellani's son" to which her friends would usually laugh... haha. It's funny to think about now. But really, I see too many shy ass kids around as kids and as teenagers and adults I deal with every day. Could've benefitted from what I did.
Thank you very much for not making the top half "Socially Awesome"
Great title.
That oughtta do the trick.
We only have as many chairs in our computer lab as there are computers (first world problem). Decided to take a quick picture before I personally took the professor aside and let her know I wouldn't sit in that chair. She was awesome and traded me since she doesn't sit in hers during class.
As an Asian, I approve.

Sorry I don't know why some of y'all can't see it. It says:  HOW TO READ THIS BOOK: If you're reading this sentence then you pretty much got it. Good job. Just keep going the way you are.
KOREAN WAR
Who the fuck would tattle?
On these guys, I sized down one. This was with the intention of curing them myself... as in like fading and all that stuff. So I did that, I cold soaked to get rid of the excess dye and wore them for 8mo hardcore before any problems occurred (see my comment below). The cinch is what sold me at first. It was really neat. However, the more I wore them, the less I felt a need to call attention to the cinch and the more it just became a thing for me to enjoy.
This exact pair of denim.
No. But I'll upvote for OW.
