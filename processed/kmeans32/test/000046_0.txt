Democracy at its worse.
They both do, but HIP only adds more provinces, not any new areas (There's no Persia or India either) whereas Lux Invicta expands the map to include a lot more of Africa/Asia. What I thought you were asking was where the even comes from, which is the VIET events thing (I forget the full name) which is a part of both modpacks. If you're wondering what mod OP is using in the picture, it's Lux Invicta.
...With his horrible smell.
This pretty much sums up anything I'd try to say. The problems I'm experiencing (and apparently the rest of the community is too) are so ubiquitous that I'd have to open 100's of tickets and most of those wouldn't result in me getting what I was supposed to.
Medieval people actually had a pretty good idea of what the world looked like (except for America and the Pacific) so the only new stuff you'd show them is stuff you wouldn't be able to back up. (Many people claimed there were America-like continents west of Europe)
Yep
I fired the event and it gave me a window saying "you're not supposed to see this" I selected the only option and I got the window saying the election was over with a random lowborn receiving over 2000 votes and he was the only candidate. I took this to be a glitch and killed him with console, upon his death the elections began again and they went through without a hitch with me being elected.  Thanks for the help. I feel really appreciative that someone on the mod team would help me troubleshoot this.
Invisible bread?
thank mr skeltal
TIFU by not Checking my Ports.   Hey guys, so I just fucked up a few minutes ago, lemme explain.  It's 2 in the morning and i'm 16, I have my own room and laptop, it's a simple laptop, a chromebook, but it does what I need it to do. However, I'm also a heavy listener of music and as such have a nice pair of over the ear headphones. So i come into my room, I had just gotten back from using the bathroom after trying to fall asleep for the past four hours, but try as I might I can't sleep.  As I come back into my room I decide that sleep isn't happening so I instead opt to go to grab my computer and surf the web. I begin surfing and after a while I decide to put on some music, I check to make sure my headset is plugged in. Now, my headset has two plugs a USB and an audio/mic cable. I can feel that it's plugged into the USB port but the audio cable isn't plugged in so I quickly fix that, however my chromebook only has one input that works as either a mic port or an audio out port.  I plug in the audio cable, not really looking, and pull up [this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IwmYAdgU18) The song starts up and I notice it's a bit quiet, so I bump up the volume on my chromebook until it's at full volume, at this point it's listenable and I'm pleasantly rocking out. About 2 minutes later my dad bursts into the room, yelling at the top of his lungs about how he has work tomorrow and I need to turn that down immediately.  I'm confused for a moment before I look down and notice that... My mic cable was plugged in instead of my audio out cable. Since I had noise cancelling headphones I hadn't noticed them yelling at me to turn it off, and I hadn't noticed that it was so quiet even at max volume because I had those on...  TL;DR: Mix up mic input and audio output cables for my headset and end up blasting Rock music at full volume at 2:00 in the morning.

East coast is beast coast.
You. I like you.
Someone needs to make this into an actual game. I would totally play it if they did.
10/Potato, would bang.
"Hey baby. Are you an oreo? 'cause I want to spread you and lick out the good stuff in the middle."
Well, you gotta make a "byeah"-ing sound. You really have go "byeah" from deep in your byeah.
No martial arts are created equal. You're right. But even the "worst" martial art could beat the "best" art depending on the practitioner. I put that rule in there because I didn't want the comment section to devolve into squabbling about how "My art is so much better than your art!"  I will reword that rule though to exclude bullshido arts from that rule.

I just don't see what you mean. If you need an example of early story telling look up ZORK, The hitchhikers guide to the galaxy, Adventure, Day of thr tentacle, or any other early text based game. Many of them came out before the NES era.  Or look at the sierra games, they also focused quite a bit on story and many came out before the first super mario bros.  All I'm saying is that story has always been a major part of gaming.
Wat
Fallout: New Vegas. The game was amazing and definitely ranks up there in my top 10 games of all time. Probably my top 5 even, but when I finally beat Lanius and general Oliver congratulated me I expected something... More, it just plays the epilogue and you have to go back to a save from before the battle at hoover dam. This was exactly what people didn't like about Fallout 3 and I understand they didn't have a post game because of time-restraints but....  I wish they had atleast had a DLC which continued it. The ending was okay, but in comparison to the rest of the game it just left me feeling empty and wanting more.
Learning how to make a stable budget is important. In fact, it's so important that the government has to do it!   ...Oh wait...
They're scaled down in that a martial artist can't just punch a hole through the universe, (a la kame sennin ryu) The fighters can use all the super duper techniques they want but can only apply as much force and speed as an Olympic level human. The guy you're talking about, (no idea who he is BTW) could use his aikido but he would only be able to do it as quickly as a normal human being, he couldn't jump 50 feet in the air he could jump 5, He couldn't punch through a concrete wall but he could punch through an interior wall.  If a certain ability couldn't be used by someone who lacks the superhuman strength of that character then the character simply can't use it.
Satanism question thread #6   Leave any questions you have about satanism or Satan below and one of the mods will answer promptly.
I myself am in a very similar situation to yours. I too live in a christian household and I'm thus, unable to perform any rituals beyond meditation before bed. What I'd recommend is thus. If you want to contact your guardian demon, either find a time when your family is gone and perform a summoning ritual then. Or try and astral project. By astral projection you could seek the guidance of a guardian demon. However, what I would most strongly recommend is to simply wait. You've already made admiral progress simply by recognizing these truths and by partaking in power meditations, no one expects you to do anything more. Simply keep meditating and wait until you're old enough to move out of your families house.

about 8:00 PM me thinks.
Although it's unlikely I think that we could very well be seeing some sort of OB2 scenario going on here. Think of all the hints going on. L4D2 being free on christmas like portal 1 was before portal 2 was released, The alleged leaked screens of source 2.0, End of the line sounds like a final update to me. and now this? I'm probably wrong but I think that this right now might be the single most likely time that valve could release a new game.  And that game just might be.... ricochet 2 ^or.. ^you ^know ^~~HL3~~ ^a ^DoD ^sequel...
Nobody knoooowssss ooooooo. Seriously though I'm gonna try and dig into this things source and see if I can find any further info.
Hotdogs.
Honestly as a member for almost a year now, I share your sentiment as do many other in the community. But by simply looking past the hateful shite on there you can find some useful information on there. Remember, don't follow anything blindly and think with your brain instead of your gut.
