If you could only use a single line from a song to talk for a day, which song and line would you choose?   You have to use the line to convey all emotions, ask/answer questions, and make general statements (think "I Am Groot").

Masturbation and beer. If I get really lost in the thought of my death, I have to use beer as a lubricant for masturbation to ease the stress even more.   Killing two birds in the bush, is worth one dick in my hand...or something like that.

Damn. That's not going to be good for me that day. At least I can get her a replacement, then.   Thanks for the help! I appreciate it.
I opened the door to my mom's Camaro as she was pulling into our gravel driveway. For some reason, my 8 year old self didn't have a seatbelt on and I went tumbling out. If she hadn't stopped the car when she did, my head would've been ran over by the back tire. Instead, I have a Harry Potter-like scar on my forehead to this day.
That's some dirty fighting, right there.
Yeah. No doubt.
Not too bad for your first time. I liked the alien aspect.
Why not? I'm too lazy to look that up.
He's in [this](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4362342/) now.  It's an interesting show, but once again he carries his co-host...IMO.
I find your choice of breakfast foods rather [shallow and pedantic](https://youtu.be/yetwdpsiM8Q).
Yes, I am glad that I didn't. I don't want him to worry about something that I did to myself in the past. He has his own issues to deal with and I didn't feel like burdening him with one of mine.  And what you said last is something that I find to be very true now. Last night I found out that my friend has gone through the same exact situation I'm in now...only 8 years ago. After our talk last night, I realized that we have a lot more in common than I originally thought.

Sounds like the beginning of a [drumline](http://i.imgur.com/zb0EgkN.jpg) beat.
I've read a version of that before somewhere and let me tell you...I fucking hate it!      Whenever my wife calls me from downstairs and I'm halfway down, that little thought pops into my head for some reason.  If I went towards her voice in the kitchen and then I heard her calling me from one of the upstairs rooms...I would probably shit myself right there.
