BANJOOOOOOOO!
Gotta give it to the superior officer he handleded that perfectly. He asked the rookie if he had any RAS and when he didn't he let him go. Good stuff all in all.
A city police officer who spent the last eight years on paid leave after being accused of sexual assault is negotiating with city over how much money he will get for the vacation days he didnt use during that time, officials said.
Just imagine if someone wrote this type of letter to the police. Just think about what they would do to that person.
This is the state of our country, the line between satire and real life has become one in the same. I am not even surprised anymore.  We have politicians who are bought by the highest bidder to shove an agenda that is bad for everyone but a few rich assholes. Democracy is dead, killed by backroom deals and corruption.   In the "Land of the Free" we have a government that has implemented some of the following in our name.   Rampant violations of the fourth amendment by the NSA.  Proxy wars orchestrated by the CIA (including drug smuggling and overthrowing governments).  Using the biggest tragedy in American history to start two failed wars, hundreds of thousands dead, billions of debt and a even more of a bad situation then when we went in.  But the biggest part of this that destroys me about this is using the horrific deaths of thousands of innocent Americans, to pass the Patriot" act, that takes away our rights.   Internal check points where citizens are told to prove citizenship (papers please). Not only that but these constitution-free zones are within 100 miles of our boarders, thats most of our population.   A militarized police force.   A failed, expensive and pointless war on drugs. That not only makes nonviolent people felons (no more vote), but turns people who have been doing what people have done for thousands of years into a crime.  There is so much more and these are only from my lifetime (28 years).    I love my country. I love the rights granted to me as an American. I am thankful for the blood that was shead for these rights.  But when I see that rich fucks run for leader of the free world I can't even be phased anymore.
I'm just pointing out the facts.  Fact is this fucking cop is going to get away with it. There is nothing to investigate, piggums bashed someone in the face with his fucking gun. Or are you saying they will find out that the gun he had on him jumped out on its own and proceeded to smash in guys face?  OP is the one with all the answers and is either using multiple accounts or a brigade.   Yeah that's totally it. Ive made over 200 accounts just to upvote this. Its not like people are starting to wake up to the growing brutality and double standard cops gets away with.
You and I both know damn well that's why they did it.
Chie is a fucking slut. Just imagine the amount of sausage she had between those lips. She was probably the town bike before you came around and she was instantly lusting after your salami next.  Her phonenumber is probably all over public toilets with the annotation that she's willing to do anything for a beefbowl.  And remember those 3 guys from her S rank? As soon as you enter the train to go back home those guys probably rape her and NTR the shit out of her, turning her into a sexslave so they don't have to pay for the meat to take turns on her

Im gonna watch it with /v/. Like I always do. /v/ maybe a shit posting, console war, weeaboo playground, but when E3 rolls around its my favorite place to be. All the cringe, all the new memes and all the disappointment. The whole experience with them makes it all worth it.

[REQUEST] Baby's full it'd be sweet if dad could be also.   So here the story im flat broke as of yesterday, I live on my own with my daughter so most of my check goes to her (she has tons of food because of WIC) and I rely on my food card too get me between checks. But I cant go shopping for food until around the 3rd, when my card refills. So im pretty screwed on having dinner. :( Sadly i have nothing to give in return but all my internets. Im in Licking County, OH
