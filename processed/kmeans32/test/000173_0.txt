The climate systems, ocean systems, solar activity, and all other factors that effect Earth's climate are very complex.   The fact that all models predicting temperature rises have been woefully wrong compared to actual data proves this.    http://www.drroyspencer.com/2013/06/still-epic-fail-73-climate-models-vs-measurements-running-5-year-means/  The 97% of scientists agree that anthropogenic climate change is occurring claim has been thoroughly debunked.    http://www.thegwpf.org/new-paper-the-97-consensus-and-its-critics/  http://www.thegwpf.org/content/uploads/2014/09/Warming-consensus-and-it-critics1.pdf  The 97% claim is based on a study by John Cook. His emails on the study are revealing:   "Its essential that the public understands that theres a scientific consensus on AGW. So [Skeptical Science activists] Jim Powell, Dana [Nucitelli] and I have been working on something over the last few months that we hope will have a game changing impact on the public perception of consensus. Basically, we hope to establish that not only is there a consensus, there is a strengthening consensus." -John Cook  Two things are immediately apparent from this email.   1. Cook had decided even before he began his investigations what those investigations would reveal.   2. This was always going to be a PR exercise, not a scientific one.  Cook's own emails further destroy any credibility in the 97% figure be showing his intentionally misleading methodology:  "Okay, so weve ruled out a definition of AGW being any amount of human influence or more than 50 percent human influence. Were basically going with Aris porno approach (I probably should stop calling it that) which is AGW = humans are causing global warming. e.g.  no specific quantification which is the only way we can do it considering the breadth of papers were surveying." -John Cook  But Cooks 97 percent consensus claim was rebutted in subsequent analyses of his study. A paper by five leading climatologists published in the journal Science and Education last year found that Cooks study misrepresented the views of most consensus scientists.  The definition Cook used to get his consensus was weak, the climatologists said. Only 41 out of the 11,944 published climate studies examined by Cook explicitly stated that mankind caused most of the warming since 1950 meaning the actual consensus is 0.3 percent.   This graph proves there has indeed been a pause in global temperatures for 18 years and running:  http://www.climatedepot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/1711years.png  The data for the graph above is from RSS satellite.  You said:  There is no ideal temperature for Earth  there is no constant to provide as an answer, CO2 levels are always changing  So how do we know that the current (or future)  temp and CO2 levels are bad? Doesn't that defeat your entire premise?

I bet you are also an MMA cage fighter, Special Forces trainer (possibly a Navy SEAL) and all the ladies love you.   No, it is obvious you are uneducated past a high school level and you are incurious of the world around you and are simply a follower. I am not criticizing you, I know I appreciate people like you when my car needs to be waxed or I need someone to serve tasty snacks at parties.   The bottom line is that I CHALLENGED YOU to provide proof and you simply could not do so. You failed plain and simple.  You proved that I was smarter than you and I appreciate the compliment.
I asked if you graduated from high school because I asked someone else a question and you butted in and made a lame comment. That seemed like the type of thing an uneducated person would do.

So we are left with conflicting data.  As the song says "Two men say they're Jesus, one of them must be wrong"  The bottom line here is that Ted Cruz and the Right base their climate change suspicions based on data. We may be wrong but we are sincere and being scientific.   Shouldn't this issue be determined using the scientific method of experimentation and reproducible results? Politics has polluted the issue and thus actual facts are often difficult to find.  How could you be against continued experimentation? Certainly scientists do not understand climate science to the point that we can simply stop exploring.
You must realize that Progresivism is not a general improvement of things, society, and the condition of the people. "Progressivism" and the policies of the Left are nothing but a rigid ideology based path towards socialism. Dissent is not allowed. Expressing contrary opinions is not allowed. Anyone who opposes the Left is evil in their eyes. The Left, AKA Progressives, Democrats, Liberals want to fundamentally change America from a Jeffersonian representative democracy into a socialist system where self appointed elites boss the common people around and compel them via intimidation and force to comply with their ideas of what a perfect society will look like.  The GOP (Grand Old Party) AKA Republicans is made up of various factions.   1. Establishment Republicans (sometimes called RINOs- Republicans In Name Only)  are old school Republicans who favor big government, immigration amnesty, and are DC insiders.  2. Tea Party Conservatives are interested in smaller government, less taxes , and less regulation, They look to the founding fathers and the Constitution for guidance in making policy. The Left often demonize the Tea Party as being racist but no evidence whatsoever has ever been produced by the left to back that false claim up. The Tea Party just wants less government interference in the people's lives. Race has absolutely nothing to do with that.  3. Libertarians believe that the government should not be involved in anything except  a very few services. They favor no drug laws, no taxes, and they want the freedom to live their lives without government interference.   I encourage you to watch Bill Whittle's Firewall series on Youtube for a great primer on politics in the US.  https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=bill+whittle+firewall  Good luck!

Asking for proof of such a switch is like asking for proof Rome existed, it's self-evident that it did.  Sorry but simply because you believe it does not make it true. Can you offer any policy statements, candidates' positions, voter outreach, advertising, or anything else to back up your claim that the GOP is racist or embraces racism as a policy.   Please realize that simply because we Conservatives are opposed to the policies of Mr Obama that does not equate with being racist. We Conservatives oppose any Leftist policy regardless of the race, sex, religion of who proposes it.   BTW the Nazis were socialists so your knowledge of politics seems to be a little suspect.
Shooting anyone, even if totally justified, will change your life. I personally go to great lengths to avoid drawing on someone even if it is legally justified.   Carrying a firearm is a great responsibility. Slights, insults, and other infractions by others can be ignored because you are carrying and those insults are thus not real challenges to your honor or manhood.   I was not there so I am not trying to criticize. I just know that drawing on someone or shooting them, even if 100% justified, will open up a Costco sized can of worms that will likely not be pleasant for everyone involved.

Interventionist strong military  He has cut the military's budget drastically. How effective has he been regarding Libya, Iraq, ISIS, Syria, Iran, Afghanistan, Yemen, Boko Harum etc etc etc? Other than drones, how could  you even claim Obama favors the military or is interventionist?  continuation of Bush domestic terror policies  See above  more money on the border  Huh? Do you realize he has directed ICE and Homeland Security to open the borders? Remember all of the refugees from central America?  Guantanamo is still open   Many prisoners have been released and returned to Jihad   taxes weren't raised  Ever hear of Obamacare?  the deficit is lower  Hahahahahahahaha. thanks, I needed a good laugh!
I agree the various socialistic systems seek to achieve the same end game via differing paths but they all end up at the same destination ultimately. That is a planned economy,  non privately held means of production and distribution (whether held by "the community" or by government), and a government (or community) centric society at the expense of personal freedom.   As for fascism, that and Naziism were true socialist ideologies. You listed some of the unique elements of their brand of socialism but you fail to acknowledge their commonality with "classical" socialism. Fascism and Naziism featured no private ownership of the means of production (and distribution), a planned economy,  and a government (or community) centric society at the expense of personal freedom.   Socialism is a family tree that shares the same roots
I tire of people like you who simply cannot distinguish/differentiate/discriminate between the actions of two groups of people and feel the need to place both groups in the same moral basket. The USA and the Nazis killed thousands of people during WWII but they did so for different reasons. They are not two sides of the same coin.   Muslim extremists have been engaging in terrorist and violent acts for centuries and against every culture they interact with. Islam is a religion based on conquest and subjugation of their rivals. Radical Islamists have been involved in thousands of religious based violent attacks in just the past 20 years. http://www.thereligionofpeace.com/index.html#Attacks (follow links to yearly lists)  The only reason the US is engaged in violent action against Muslim extremists is because they simply won't leave us alone. They have already declared war against us unilaterally.   According to your logic, a robber who enters a store and shoots a clerk and the store owner who defends himself and shoots the robber are moral equivalents because they were both shooters engaged in violence.  If you cannot see the difference between the two or the difference between what the US does and what Muslim extremists do then you are indeed being juvenile and naive and engaged in wishful thinking.
It's not Ad hominem because it is not simply a meaningless attack of Warren for being a bitch. It is a criticism of a necessary requirement for leadership. I demand all leaders be trustworthy and not place their goals ahead of the people's needs.   Warren has a documented history of lying. Even her husband lied about being a Native American too.   Please look at this chart:  http://i.imgur.com/qqhr4dK.jpg?1  This is the relative Warren claimed made her Native American. As you can see her claim is a total fabrication.
You are 100% wrong. The only portion of the middle class that the New Deal created was from hiring government bureaucracy employees.  May I suggest you read a book on US History? Your knowledge on the subject is based on Liberal ideology and not historical fact.

The oil and gas released from fracking is collected via a controlled tube. There are many shale and impermeable rock layers between the oil and gas and the surface and ground water. The fracking process only fracks a few layers leaving most layers intact.   I understand your frustration and need to be snarky but is there a part of you who can simply discuss the factual realities of fracking?  Turn off the religious part of your brain and just weight the facts.   A question for you:  If fracking methods and fossil fuel usage were technologically advanced to the point that we could guarantee that no environmental damage ever occurred, would you  accept fracking and the use of fossil fuels?
