Did someone say Dim Sum?
Plenty of options in Kansas City.  I would recommend Water Works.  It's pretty close to I-35. Waterworks Park 100192 Water Works Rd Kansas City, MO  64116 United States
looks fake.
Pizzaman in Lenexa off Pflumm and 103rd.  Chicago family owned - thin crust.  They have a killer Italian Beef pizza - just do it.
i just picked up a Gstar TL3.  needs some beating before it flies understable like TL.
I purchased the Weber Genesis in Green of Amazon a couple months ago.  It was delivered for free to my backyard (I helped the driver).  Assembling the unit proved to be simple - this isn't an Ikea grill.  I've been grilling constantly since I purchased it and am extremely happy with it.  Just rip the bandaid and do it!
recipe!?

Apparently they make an exception for him.  He must not be as big of a cunt as some of you turds think.

it appears you received some great info already.  i moved to KC from WI in 2004.  in 2008 i moved to FL for a new job.  i just moved back to KC in july of 2013 because i couldn't stand FL!   i'm so happy to be back in the midwest!  here are a few things i noticed having lived in both states (i lived in boca raton/fort lauderdale area):  1)  the people here are ridiculously nice.  if you make eye contact in public chances are the person will smile or say hi.   in florida i felt that if i made eye contact with a stranger that they would want to fight or run the other way.  the fake people in So.FL are the worst.  everyone is trying to one up each other.    2)  traffic.  anyone that has only lived in the greater KC area and complains about KC traffic, you haven't been to FL.  i don't miss the snowbirds or the tourists lost while looking for disney.  3)  cost of living.  when living in FL you're paying tourist prices.  i don't miss waiting for a table anytime i wanted to go out to eat.    4)  parks.  KC has some amazing parks.  what i experienced in florida was that it was so crowded that parks didn't really exist.  builders in florida would rather put a few high rises and make more money.  5)  the weather.  while people in FL are probably asking how you could leave FL for KS, the weather is very fair here.  people will tell you, if you don't like the weather in KC, just wait a day, it will change.  while living in FL i really started to miss the midwest seasons.
i also love holding doors for strangers.  the true test is holding a door for someone who is about 20 feet away.  if they pick up their pace they are truly grateful.  either way, a simple gesture can make someones day.
