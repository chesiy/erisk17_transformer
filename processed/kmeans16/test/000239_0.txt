they won't take the site down they are not going to give up a site with 40 million (even if most are bots or scammers) accounts because some hackers told them to  they will call the bluff and the hackers won't do anything  got to say i'm getting sick of hackers atm and all the threats and ddos attacks etc etc
too many years of the drug war has people believing it's the right way to go about it not to mention countless scare campaigns and the usual BS this nanny state country pulls  people would rather continue fighting a failed drug war and keep criminals rich than try something else like many other countries have  it's why they have no fucking clue what to do about ice atm except those idiotic scare ads which have no effect whatsoever
Williams isn't winning anything as a customer team he's knows that and will take a offer from Ferrari  Mercedes won't dominate forever, Ferrari looks the best next option unless red bull gets there shit together and gets a car that doesn't explode almost every race. Mclaren won't be a challenger for at least 3-4 years and it seems they have a driver line up for the next few years
disappointed in the Master Armorers Quest Armor   the stats and what not are great but i wasn't expecting it be witch hunter armor  witch hunters are cunts and i don't want to look like a cunt  don't know why they thought that would be a good reward
Its not essential but it helps so you know the characters from the last two games and some of The back story about the wars and what not  Though if the 3rd game is the first one you played you might not like the first two (game play not the story)  movement is completely different like no jumping or climbing unless there is a press whatever to jump or climb,  plus combat is different as well
i was fine with it at first but it got annoying towards the end  every single time i heard Geralt say gotta take a look around i knew i would be spending the next few minutes following a red trail towards something
because people just don't like them and think they are a bunch of loonies  people will always vote labor/liberals reguardless of the shit they do because they don't want the greens in power  this is highly unlikely to ever change
$30 Billion wiped off Aussie sharemarket
the hate comes from the fact the guy is overhyped and seems to have a big head because of it.. people are already calling him a future world champion and what not  plus not taking the blame for the Monaco crash saying he was brake tested didn't help either
it's declining and has been for a while it's the whole reason why there was that meeting to discuss changes and why so many past and present drivers are suggesting ideas to make it interesting again.  sure there are fans that love it how it is but without new fans coming in the sport can't survive.  the biggest complaint i see from people who are not diehard fans is that it's boring and predictable, it's not helped that it went from 4 years of vettel domination (even with those 2 close years) to the current 2 years of utter complete Mercedes domination.  then you have broadcasting which in many areas is no longer on free to air tv and attending races costs an arm and a leg and probably a liver as well
Queensland Liberal and panel member Steve Ciobo was unapologetic, saying he believed the only reason Mr Mallah was acquitted of terrorism was that the terrorist offences "weren't retrospective in application", and that he would be glad to see Mr Mallah sent out of the country.  so would i he was jailed for threatening to kill asio and other government staff and traveled to Syria during the Arab spring  he clearly supports ISIS and has no place in civilised society  if he's left unchecked he could easily become the next man monis
don't see what will make anyone spew she worked and saved money and bought properties  any money she received from the family was wisely used instead of been pissed up the wall like most people at that age  I think the reason why people think they cannot buy property is because they want a multi-million dollar house now. Youve got to start somewhere and build it up, she said."  that is actually sound advice.. lots of people are not willing to live far from the city so prices are much higher, the further you move the cheaper it is.. the commute might suck but you'll have a cheap decent home/apartment
hes already been proven otherwise he just doesn't want to admit he made a mistake  with a attitude like that i won't be surprised if he crashes into another wall this year
anytime something happens to Hamilton his fanboys come out with the sabotage remarks.
honestly i think Ricciardo gets a little more credit then he deserves due to last year.. his wins came from safety cars and when Mercedes had issues  what i want to see is him get a good car for a few years and see if he can consistently pull off results like 2014 or if it was just a one off  right now the red bull is a turd so you can't count this year to be fair to him
events are getting much harder to compete in   just noticed the new event so had a quick go  got 1.6 million on my first try (died because of a stupid mistake)  i thought that would be good enough for a decent position that i could work on later.. nope 360th place don't even want to kow what the top 50 scores would be  1.6 million in previous events would of got into the top 100 no problems seems now you got to get over 4-6 million to place well
