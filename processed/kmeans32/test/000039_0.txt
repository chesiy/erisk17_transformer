I like your thought process! Those are all really good points. I bet it is a drug of some sort when you put it that way.

Jesus Christ! If you want to be an asshole about this whole thing then lets take a look at your beautiful very polite post we have here. Not a shred of reasoning to disprove anything. I thought this was a safe place with knowledgeable individuals. Put down the bong? Really? All I was doing was throwing a theory out there and hoping for intelligent people to explain why this definitively could not work because I sincerely want to know. None of which you addressed. like the idea of that dark matter and black holes may be linked which is probably non-since but I guess ideas (even exotic ones) are worthless to you. I have studied astrophysics, graduated, and somehow I still manage to not be a total dick. I just wanted to throw out a crazy idea that I wanted others to disproof and talk about. After all isn't that the basis of new ideas? Thank you for your very awesome post that will surly incurage me to be less open minded. Much apreciated
I also read somewhere that Suboxone added the Naloxone to its recipe just so they could patent the name because just bup was taken by the brand subutex and that bup itself is the primary blocker and the low dose of the Naloxone doesnt do much at all. If what I read is right then suboxone and subutex block opiates the same way and you can't feel a p30 on eather. Please help me guys cause I thought this was common knowlage but my friend thinks hes 100% sure.

Yes true, but it says they only had a glimpse of it. Just enough time to see something and jump to conclusions. Then question everything you know.

We ended up going to the jewely store today. Got the ring cut off professionally and it can now be repaired and sized. [HERES](http://i.imgur.com/72R5CHd.jpg) a pic. And one of her [FINGER](http://i.imgur.com/VeWTRWW.jpg)
Hey, thanks a lot. I appreciate it!

It's great that you took in consideration to blur the snowflakes. It gives the piece movement and makes you feel the womens chill from the wind. Nice job. I use Photoshop and paint and do stencil work but from what I know this takes mad patience.

yea but thats not all stencil work. Most of it I hand painted. Tedious work. I'm glad my friend took the picture because the wall was taken down a week later. But the photo lives on!
First we bought one plan at our local skate store but it was too expensive and too big. After looking everywhere online I stumbled onto this plan. It was so detailed and perfect for what we were looking to build. I couldn't tell you where to find it but it was perfect because it was just big enough and if I recall just under 500 dollars. But we had a bunch of left over plywood we stashed under the half pipe. So the best advise I can give is try to find something in your budget, have some friends help you, and get all the material before you start. And make sure that shits level. The surface is 2 layers. First plywood, then skate-light or something similar. Let me know if you have anymore questions.
Me and some friends built this in the dead of winter in 2007 when I was in high school. Still skate-able to this day.
Holy monkey balls.
It deserves lots of love indeed. Man, the hours I spent on the school bus playing that. Remember how awesome and new it was to have a lighted screen?
I still have a lot of kinks to work out. This is pretty much a first draft of a cool idea I had, so not much effort went into the physics of it yet. Thank you for your concern for my safety. I already play it very safe and you are very right about a fail to lift scenario. That would really suck but I would treat it like you said, as a loaded gun. Maybe I will even go as far as launching it from inside my jeep and film it instead of standing next to it just in case.
My idea for my next homemade model/firework rocket. Would like feedback/thoughts.

Hey thanks for the heads up. I rely to much on spell check and the rage maker doesn't underline misspelled words. my bad... my bad
no, I didn't mean to lead you on. I didn't realize these sets have hardly any value. Its been about ten years and all the cards are in mint condition. I assumed I could get at least 100 or more but someone said they saw a set on amazon for 7-9 dollars. Guess I'm going to have to wait until they become more valuable.
