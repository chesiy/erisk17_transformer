Pogs.   In elementary all the cool rich kids had them. I was a poor immigrants son with no allowance. Our family was dirt poor. I'm talking hand-me-downs between the girls and boys. So naturally seeing all these kids playing this cool game at any chance they could really angered me because I couldn't even buy one. I decided to sneak a few away from some classmates thinking they wouldn't notice. The teacher caught me red handed. She called my parents for a conference so she could hand out my punishment. My parents asked what the consequences are and my teacher said "I need about tree fiddy"  it was about that time I noticed that wasn't my teacher but a 50 ft tall creature from the paleolithic Era. I said "get out of here you god dammed loch Ness monster"
Not OP's pic. He is just a reposter
That's a meem
I hate those.
The crust is a prepared dough from Pillsbury.   The sauce:  5 dried pasilla or ancho chiles, stemmed and seeded  Two 6-inch corn tortillas, or handful regular tortilla chips  2 tablespoons olive oil  1 1/2 medium onions, chopped  Kosher salt  2 cloves garlic, minced  2 tablespoons smooth peanut butter  1 teaspoon dried oregano  1 3/4 cups chicken stock  One 3.1-ounce disk Mexican chocolate, chopped, such as Ibarra or Abuelita   Freshly ground black pepper  Other ingredients:  1 1/2 cups cooked chicken. I prefer chicken legs  Cilantro  Queso fresco  Crema fresca  Sesame seeds (optional)  To make the sauce, blend all sauce ingredients until smooth consistency.   Precook the dough for a crispier texture and better mouth feel. Otherwise you will get raw dough. Top with sauce and chicken and bake until dough is fully cooked. After it's done, top with queso, cilantro, crema fresca, and sesame seeds.
Anything you need. I've got it

That 19.2 volt system is terrible. Low torque and battery life. Get him a Dewalt or makita 18v or 20v system
Funny?
Sorry but I can't  be seen associating with you. Mr burrito eater

Know and understand, you no longer live for yourself
Not sure, but I bet using the search function is part of it
Not full on archealogy, but amateur hunting. There are a few places near me where you can pick fossils up from the surface. No shovel required. It's a great way to burn off some extra calories walking all day, being outside. And the feeling when you find something, is amazing.  Check out /r/fossilhunting for more info.
Then yes, op and her mom

You need encouragement? Did you put a little too much money into dogecoin than you could afford?   Dogecoin has been around since December (as have I) and so much has been accomplished! The water wells, Jamaican bobsled team, save them hood, Nascar. The community is always positive and has grown to almost the size of btc. For dogecoin to go away it would mean that no one mines anymore and there are no more merchants to accept it and no longer has volume on exchanges. I don't see that happening anytime
Stop using the drive if possible. Load it into another pc and run recovery software like "Recuva" looking for any *.key files (I believe that's the wallet from multidoge)
Hehe Thanks I forgot about those
I love you for this.
I'll load up a tip and hopefully it goes through later  +/u/tacotipper 1000 tacos

They already did at the 1.6 fork/update. It's called digishield and the digibyte guys helped with it.   The reason multipools are still mining doge is because of the profitability.
Um hmm
