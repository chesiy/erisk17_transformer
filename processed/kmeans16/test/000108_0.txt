You woke up with wet pants? Was it piss?
Thats intense as hell.
Well it was 2008 or 2009. I was at my parents house alone. I was looking for something in the guest bedroom when I felt like i was being watch. I glance over my shoulder to see it standing by the door. I did a double take and turned all the way around only to see it glide out through the doorway. I was shocked so I slowly walked to the door but it was gone. I dont remember going into the bathroom or filling up the tub. But I do remember being underwater long enough that I started seeing a white light that seemed to be getting brighter. Then the light started faded away in the distance and I regain my senses and sit up to find out Im in the tub of water. Desperately trying to catch my breathe again, I was so confused. Right next to the tub was a statue of Jesus I guess I brought into the bathroom and I kind of broke down and started crying. I haven't seen the shadow since then.

Well since I've been using the app for almost a year I've met about 10 girls that actually wanted to meet. Thats very good for a guy like me. Im average looking i just put the basics and keep it simple. I get their attemtion by asking them about something they are interested in. Usually you can find that out on their profile. Its alot of hit and miss but its still effective
