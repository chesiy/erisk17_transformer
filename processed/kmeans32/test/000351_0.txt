And is anyone else kind of, dare I say it, glad that those particular subreddits were banned?
I know of a store that has had a "sale" on for over 6 months now. People think they're making huge savings and it pisses me off so much cos the price has never actually been reduced.   In fact, does anyone know if this legal in the UK? I'd love for Trading Standards to stumble across this one.
Improve your public speaking skills in Reading!   Hi everyone,  My name is Josh and am the current Vice President of Membership at Reading Speakers Club. The club is part of an international speaking organisation called Toastmasters International (NOT the guys in the red coats, don't worry) and we're always on the look out for new members who want to improve their public speaking/leadership skills in a safe, supportive environment.  I personally joined the club last year and I can't believe the progress that I've made in such a short time - 9 months ago I was on the verge of being diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, but thanks to the confidence I gained at this club I'm now happier than ever. Its a very rare thing for a person to make permanent and genuine change in themselves, but every month I witness more and more people growing in confidence and becoming truly talented speakers at this club.  I just wanted to put the word out there that this club exists, as it is not always well publicised. Our next meeting is at 7:30pm, Monday 6th July at Salisbury Conservative Club (near Cemetery Junction).  Please feel free to come along as a guest and see if this club is for you. It's a great group of people who are all really fun, supportive and willing to go the extra mile to help you.   PM me for more details or visit the website https://www.toastmasters.org/
Fellow plane viewer here! Unfortunately I watched it on the way back from Australia and it made me want to book more travelling straight away, wish I'd seen it on the way out!
Two main reasons in this case. 1. This guy steals as a business and is a regular around my town, he'll head out with a list of requests and then sell them on to his buyers. 2. I was really fucking bored on that shift and I couldn't resist the adrenaline rush!
I tend to get that with international students a lot who couldn't afford to do one at home. Always a bit of an awkward situation as somebody was convinced they'd spotted a tumour in their scan once and we got an angry phone call from their GP asking why we gave pictures out.   It was nothing more than a spot of hypochondria though!
Acid rain, never heard of it since.
I'm a uni student and the only reason I take that seat is because I'm doing the exact same thing! I remember being inspired to do this by Dave Vitty on the Chris Moyles show when I was a wee teenager.
I don't believe in God in a traditional sense, but I'm open to the idea that there could be something out there akin to a God. It could have personality flaws, it may not be powerful enough to be aware of everything it created, hell, it may even be that our universe is a kids toy to teach baby aliens the meaning of life and death.  I simply accept the idea that there are so many things that I will never understand and maybe a God would be one of those things.

I think Americans do this as sport.

Hi Jstbcool  First of all, thanks for your incredibly well structured and thought out response. It's rare to see that on the internet!  I'm surprised I missed the effect sizes and it's definitely something that we need to be aware of, you make a very good point. In fact one of the things that stood out for me in this paper is the fact that they computed their required sample size a-priori in terms of power. It's refreshing to see people embracing the "new statistics".  I didn't mean to suggest that the participants played 8 hours of luminosity straight. However, having participated in a lot of Psychology experiments myself I felt I could speculate pretty accurately as to which of the two trials would be more tiring. Portal 2 is likely to be much more engaging and most importantly, fun. I think this would affect participants attitudes towards the testing as a whole, particularly with regards to motivation. Motivation is something we take for granted in Psychology a lot and I would hazard a guess that it will have had an effect even in the testing phase.  My third point stems from the reading I've done into the effects of nutrition on cognition. Nutrition is a pretty fascinating subject because there are huge pitfalls in a lot of the research and these are often worsened once cognitive testing is brought into the mix. It's not uncommon in this field of research for a cognitive benefit to be apparent on the day of testing, but to have disappeared once tested again a few weeks later. But, in defence of this study, it is a good starting point for further research to explore longer term effects.   If this study can be replicated, it'd be interesting in the future to work out exactly what aspects of Portal 2 are causing the cognitive benefit. It's extremely difficult to break down the components of such a complicated game, especially as it wasn't designed to be a brain training device. I get the impression that dedicated brain-training games are simple because developers attempt to make them evidence-based. By jumping in with Portal 2 we've almost worked in the opposite direction; we have a game that may cause a cognitive benefit, but we have no idea what the mechanics are which make this happen.
Sometimes it's awesome because if I stay calm I can generally transition from sleep paralysis into a lucid dream.  Sometimes it's just the most terrifying feeling, you can put all your effort into moving and nothing gives. You start to worry it'll never end. Luckily I've realised that sleep paralysis doesn't extend to my tongue, so if I freak out I start moving my tongue a lot and movement seems to slowly return to the rest of my body. Man, I'm weird.

This was fascinating, thanks for sharing!
I find they're really helpful. All of the unpleasant feelings that you have at the moment are based on what is going to happen in the future. If you practice meditation or mindfulness you can start to focus yourself to be in the moment, and speaking from experience this is a huge release. It helps you release that at any moment you can get away for these horrible feelings if you need to.  Do you have a smart phone? There's an app I could recommend, if not I can have a quick look for some online sources
Looks more like two hippocampi.
I did half-GOMAD about a year or so ago and it definitely did work. The biggest problem is trying to adapt to a normal diet afterwards - milk doesn't really stretch your stomach that much and I found that I actually lost weight when I tried to switch back to solid foods as I couldn't eat as many solid calories.

I just got given a sample of this but I'm totally new to shaving properly, should I be excited??
Goodbye xbox live membership!
Really?? I always assumed it started using the necks of beer bottles but that's way more disgusting and cool!  And I found the album on spotify so I'll check it out, cheers for the recommendation
RIP this subreddit
While I admire what he achieve with his body, this guy is a massive douche and represents everything wrong with male culture today.  Downvotes ahoy!
This is awesome to jam to, love it!
