[AU] Gigabyte P37W or P37K   Trying to decide whether the extra ~$400 is worth it to upgrade to the [P37W](http://www.gigabyte.com.au/products/product-page.aspx?pid=5349) from the lead in [P37K](http://www.gigabyte.com.au/products/product-page.aspx?pid=5375). The laptops are not cheap so I am trying to keep it reasonable. I specifically need a relatively high powered, thin gaming machine with internal optical drive at a min 17".  From what I can see, the only difference is the upgrade from a [GTX 965M](http://gpuboss.com/graphics-card/GeForce-GTX-965M) to a GTX 970M in the P37W.  According to GPUBoss, the 970M is up to 35% more powerful, has a larger memory bus and higher clock speed.  Does anyone have an opinion as to whether the upgrade would be worth the extra cash? I'd love some help. Also, please let me know if I am overthinking things and the 965M is perfectly solid.  Thanks!
Holy shit yes

Thank you /u/lilypetal! I love your suggestion about natural sunlight, I will have to rearrange our room but I think I can work it. And I hadn't thought about the spills, either. I imagine that as nice as a wood finish would look it would be horrible for stains.
No, I don't think he minds to much. He knows anything on Facebook is public domain. It was more of a hilarious shock I think!
