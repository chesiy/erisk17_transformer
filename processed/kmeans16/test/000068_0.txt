Lad :D  How did he do?
Math IA Idea Question   Hey r/IBO! I cannot think of a topic that is within our syllabus (SL) and that makes any sense. Could you please help me find something. For example, the '4 colour theory' that many of you may know off, is interesting - but how exactly does one write a math IA about it? I do not understand. :(   I'm interested in many different areas so hopefully this shouldn't be too hard. Areas I am interested in: Investing/stock market (anything really) Economics - (more macro) Rocket launches and rockets generally History (ww1, ww2) Military of armies Nukes  4 colour theory (Plan B)
Than you. This is the kind of response im looking for.
You are awesome
:'(
Hey r/mapporn! To commemorate the end of the war, here are maps that show the events unfolding. Please tell me any inaccuracies! I want to note I did this unrelated to Mapporn and throughout a rather long time period, so the quality is inferior to my expectations.  http://imgur.com/a/JzU3O  Key: I did not think of it as being crucial considering everyone knows about world war 2, but here it is:  Blue: Allies  Dark light blue: UK  Light light blue: occupied allied* territory and colonies  Dark dark blue: France  Light dark blue: occupied french territory and colonies  Red: USSR and allies  Dark red: USSR  Light red: occupied soviet territory  Axis: Grey  Dark grey: Nazi Germany  Medium grey: German allies  Light grey: Axis occupied territory  Blue arrows: allied movements  Red arrows: soviet movement  Black arrows: axis movement  *Allies: includes all shown on map, USA, other colonies and dominions, and post-liberated France.  Again, I want to apologise for the low quality, I did not mean to do them to post them here.Furthermore, please find any mistakes, I am sure there are many! I want to apologise in advance for the lack of Lake Lagoda, lack of consistency in the shades and again for the poor camera quality.
That should be a quote! When was the last time you invested in something?
Great response. Thank you.
Thanks for the great answer. Exactly what I was looking for. I have two questions:  1) In how much trouble will I get into if I don't do anything (assuming that this remains a small thing and I don't have anyone go and sue me).  2) Can I get in trouble for things that the other parties have agreed to. If they agree 'I understand I may lose all my money', and then I they try to sue me for losing their money, will I get in trouble?  3) What are the chances I even get caught if this remains a small side thing with no 'lose all the money'?   PS. I consider myself a value investor (risk averse, long term), not a trader (speculation, high risk, potential for huge mistakes).
"living in France". Updated.
In my humble (and often wrong) opinion, I believe the veto is not meant to be beneficial, but is meant to allow the great powers* to have checks and balances, so that no one power is too powerful. And I believe that by not allowing any nation too much power / making compromise and dialogue effective, leads to more benefits to the entire world in the long term. It also gives the incentive to large nations to want to remain in the UN (eg. USSR in the 1950s). Look at the league of nations to see what happens when one power/one side is too powerful.   However, as you've mentioned, this has lead to numerous local mishaps at best, genocides at worst. Try looking at the bigger picture. Hope my answer helped, tell me if im wrong.
A legal question from a 17 year old.   Hey r/Investing! I hope this post matches the high quality that this amazing subreddit provides to all. If I fail to do so, please tell me so. I will keep it short. I am a 17 year old and I invest (shares and bonds), living in France. My question is a more legal one. I am interested in selling 'shares' of my portfolio, which would allow my 'partners' in the 'investment vehicle' to see their investment grow and fall in par with my capital gains/losses. I don't plan to make this a big thing, but I am still curious whether this is legal or not, and whether this entails me to any risks if I fail (I plan on providing a document on this).
I would love doing that, but its impossible living in the middle of Paris. I was thinking maybe bringing newspapers or even breakfast (croissant, etc.) to neighbors (and later grow) every morning. What do you think?
ELI5: How to purchase government bonds in secondary markets   Hey r/investing!  Im having trouble understanding how to buy bonds (I am only interested in government ones) in secondary markets. I understand what face value, coupon, yield, etc. mean and how they are calculated and what they represent; but I fail to understand how to buy them and how the secondary bond market system works.  I would be very grateful if anyone helps :) Besides, bonds are the other side of the coin in investment, and yet, bond investment is so underrepresented here. I am sure an answer here would help at least a couple of you out there.  Thanks for the help, and wish you all the best for your portfolios! :)
Wtf happened to botswana
1) What the hell did I just see! Do people actually play on that!?  2) Its true, those colourful boards are plainly a pain. However, why do you want Stauton peices? I was thinking of making newer, more elegant and simple designs (but certainly not abstract pieces where you could not tell the difference between a rook and a bishop).  3) Thanks so much for the advice! You are the real mvp! I can use any material really, and wood certainly is the easiest option, but I really wanted to experiment with "new" materials, such as aluminium? I was not thinking of glass as I imagine it could be easily broken when travelling (saphirre or gorilla glass may be too expensive).  4) Will do! In your opinion, do you think I should?  5) Sounds interesting and aesthetic, but how would that help?  Thank you so much for the detailed post! I didn't expect such a great answer!
