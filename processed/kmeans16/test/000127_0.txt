Hm, good point. I figured liquor was an easy fix, but it's probably the best option. Thanks for the tip!
yeah!
Who Said Chivalry Was Dead?? - Funny Story   I was just in line at the bank. The guy in front of me was some creepy old guy wearing a AAA uniform. The girl behind me was an attractive Latina nurse.   So the old guy starts hitting on the nurse pretty hard. Calls her spicy, compliments her figure and generally eye-fucks her the whole time. I could tell that she was getting really uncomfortable, and felt like I should intervene. I mean, I was sandwiched between them so it's not like I could ignore it all. So, I did what I do best: I start hitting on the old pervert. Hardcore.   I generally repeated the things he said to her, complimented his mustache and uniform and said it would look best on my bedroom floor. I even winked a few times. I could tell this guy was incredibly homophobic and hated the fact that he was getting hit on by a guy. He did, however, understand the point I was making and got out of line and left. He even apologized.   The girl thanked me and said she'd never seen anyone do that. I just replied that I'm always happy to fight fire with fire.   So is this something I can get knighted for? I'd love to be knighted.
