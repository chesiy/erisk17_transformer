It wasn't entirely intentional that I am just now entering The Strip. I followed where I felt the game was leading me all the way down south then east before heading up north to Freeside. Once there, I had other quests to take care of that to me as far north as Nellis AFB and as far west as Jacobstown.
I'm not sure if you've decided yet, but here is the opinion of a mega fan who has played each game in the series:   Begin with  **Final Fantasy X**.    The graphics are new enough to not be offensive or distracting to modern gamers. The story and world are both beautiful works of art. The cast of characters is unique while each party member still holds traditional JRPG roles. It's the first voice-acted Final Fantasy, so there are some flaws there, but still a great game overall.
Have any of you ever seen the Assassin's Creed Encyclopedia?   I didn't even know it existed. When I came across it at the store tonight I had to make myself a spot on the floor and spend some time with it. It has original artwork and tons of incredible information.   I took a few pics:  [Encyclopedia Cover](http://i.imgur.com/IikVpyi.jpg?1)  [Introduction + Ezio](http://i.imgur.com/KWG2CUr.jpg)  [The Blades](http://i.imgur.com/5Q9rxJ9.jpg)  [Cast of Characters](http://i.imgur.com/1etjK3T.jpg)  My wife's favorite: [Haytham Kenway](http://i.imgur.com/Cej6yV7.jpg)

Bunny Lovers, help. There is fur EVERYWHERE!!!   Guys, our bunny's shedding is OUT OF CONTROL!   It's not coming out in clumps and she isn't acting ill so I don't think that she is sick or anything. And it has only been going on for two weeks now. We just think that she is shedding her winter coat in preparation for summer. But it has never shed this much.   There are flurries of bunny fur flying around the room. When we pet her, our hands look like hairy gloves. Her cage now has carpet.  **Is it normal for bunnies to shed this much!?**
Don't we all!
pls
It was just another day. Though, this day he was Jennifer.  He knew so thanks to the alarm on his phone that must have been going off for two minutes already. The screen read: "GET UP JENNIFER! Seriously, last chance if you want makeup today." He didn't.  After the second snooze wore off and the alarm sounded again, he forced himself out of bed and found his way to the bathroom. It was always awkward being a girl, even more so a teenage girl. As usual, he lifted his nightshirt to check himself out. *Could be worse*, he thought. And it could have been. He recalled the terrible day he woke up as middle school principal's secretary Shelia. Ugly, overweight, married to some bad-breath slob who tried for morning snuggles. That day was a living nightmare. Screw Shelia.  He found some clothes that looked what he would consider to be cute, tied his hair in a bun, skipped the makeup, and went downstairs. There was commotion in the kitchen. His mom started as soon as he walked in.  "Jennifer, are you kidding me? You're going to be late for school! I packed you a lunch, it's on the counter. Please get your stuff and get your brother to school on time." He knew it was his mom because he wasn't stupid. Also, he had done this many times before. Different people, different names, same story. He mumbled something so that his mother would know he had heard her, retrieved his purple backpack, and then grabbed his lunch off of the kitchen counter. Little brother was waiting at the door before he, Jennifer, could grab the keys to what he hoped would be his own car. He followed the boy out into the garage and into the red Prius. *Ew, that kind of Jennifer.*   He didn't know how to get to the middle school, much less his own school, which he assumed was a local high school.    "Can you tell me how to get to your school?"   "Real funny, Jen. You take me to school every single day."  "I know. It's...just a test." This wasn't his first rodeo. Little brothers love to be challenged.   They made it to Caddo Middle School as the bell rang. He smiled and waved by to his brother before rummaging through his backpack for clues as to where Jennifer attended. It was easy to locate, park, and even attend classes, talking to friends who spoke first and remaining quiet and passive in class. Everything went downhill at volleyball practice.  Coach Bates was a frumpy male-looking female--short graying hair, sagging skin, and a voice that was uncomfortably deep. Apparently, Jennifer was supposed to be one of Coach Bates' best athletes, at least when it came to hitting a white ball over a suspended net. And while Jennifer might have been swift and agile in her own body, he most definitely was not. He couldn't fake it either. Halfway through practice, Coach sent him back to the locker room to change. He was a little embarrassed, but he didn't really care. Jennifer would have to be the one to put up with the consequences of today, tomorrow.   As he pulled off his sports bra, he heard a noise. Instinctively, he covered his chest and looked around the room. He was alone. Everyone else was at practice.   Slowly, he walked through the aisle between the lockers, stopping at one that seemed to be rattling. Pulling the locker opened, three high school boys tumbled out onto the locker room floor in a panic. It was an accident. They didn't mean to. It was Cliff's idea. All sorts of excuses came spilling out of their mouths. None of them were true. It was obvious, they wanted to see some naked girls and that's that. Jennifer wasn't having it.   He dropped her bra. The boys gasped. He reached down for Cliff's hand, beckoning him to stand. He did. Jennifer leaned in, his chest against Cliff's, and whispered in his ear. "Don't let me *ever* see you in here again." He reared back and then slammed his fragile little hand into Cliff's nose. He howled in pain. The three boys ran out of the locker room, two laughing, one crying.   Later that night he lay in bed remembering the events of the strange day. It wasn't the only strange day he had had. Most, in fact, were awkward to some degree. He was sure that he had broken Jennifer's hand. He tried to hide it from mom, but she had noticed and bandaged it up until they could have the school nurse look at it in the morning. He couldn't even begin to imagine how confused Jennifer would be tomorrow. A broken hand, a few new enemies at school, an angry coach, and a fresh new key scratch down the side of her precious Prius. But, none of it was his problem anymore.  Tomorrow he could quite possibly be a Rick or a Dave or Juan. He might even wake up as Coach Bates. He never knew what to expect. Today, he had been Jennifer. It was just another day.

I finally got to play AC:U as it was meant to be played.   ^^Preface: ^^I ^^know ^^that ^^there ^^have ^^probably ^^been ^^other ^^posts ^^such ^^as ^^this ^^one, ^^but ^^due ^^to ^^my ^^excitement, ^^I ^^just ^^had ^^to ^^make ^^one ^^of ^^my ^^own. ^^Carry ^^on.  I came home from Thanksgiving travels today and sat down at the computer, downloaded Patch 3, and started up Unity. For the first time, I was able to open the game online without a single crash. For the first time, I was able to up all graphics to max settings and saw very few graphical issues (970 for those wondering). For the first time, I was able to open a blue Companion App chest *and* a yellow Initiate's chest. For the first time, I was able to play a co-op mission in all of it's splendor. For the first time, I was able to play AC:U as it was meant to be played...and it was awesome.  I would love to connect with some of you via co-op because I can only imagine how could missions would be with skilled assassins by my side. Feel free to PM me or post your detail below.  I am excited once again. This does not excuse what Ubisoft did with the launch of an unfinished game. But I am finally content with being able to experience AC:U in the way it was meant to be played.
What a beautiful gift to give your daughter when she is grown.
My wife and I went as Doc and McFly last Halloween. I think it turned out pretty decent: http://i.imgur.com/ibGVCrT.jpg
GPU suggestions?
You just made my day. BunnyProof.com. That is hilarious.  I am looking at Logitech speakers as I've been really impressed with them in the past. Is there one you would suggest? One that might be comparable to the Z-4 of the past?
True on that. I'm just kinda fed up with all the talk I'm hearing about it all. It has blown up into a game that has no females in it whatsoever. It has become a game from a corporation that hates women (not true). Oh yeah, don't forget that Ubisoft is a racist corporation also because every assassin has been white (also not true). They did bring some of it on themselves by their first lousy response. I just think it could have been immediately remedied by a better, more thought out response.
That's cute. :)   http://imgur.com/FwWTc4H
I value your opinion, but disagree. I hate making the comparison, but that is like saying that everyone who plays League of Legends publicly desires to play competitively, Ranked, or Major League.   I think there are a large majority that just want a casual, fun, and nice atmospheric game to play when bored. I don't think we can offer them that right now.  **Edit:** I read your comment as "players will always be looking for something more." That's not what you said. However, I'll leave my post as I believe the comparison still stands.

Exactly.

I look on Craigslist until my eyes grow sore. Luckily, I am an hour away from a military base where men and women are leaving at a moments notice and need to sell a car. That is often how I get them so cheap.  Just look for a deal and wait patiently for a deal and a deal will present itself!

I'm playing a free online competitive game called **TagPro**.   I know it's been mentioned before, but it is a great game. It is still a new game; in its birthing stages. It is simple in style and gameplay. Think capture the flag, but as rolling balls with spikes and bombs. If you aren't playing yet, or haven't even given it a try, do a quick Google search for TagPro and play a game or two. See how addicting it becomes.
[Outfit Feedback](http://i.imgur.com/Eipf2Bm.jpg)  This is a shirt, a pant, and two shoes kinda look.
I'm not sure that the original image of "Great Fall" was confirmed a fake. I know that some of the "leaked" videos were.   I personally think it was completely fake, along with Desert Son, but I wouldn't doubt that there will be two releases this year.
Looking for a good looking athletic shoe.   Here are the qualities I am looking for in the shoe:  * I don't want to spend more than $75. * They need to be a dark color (preferably black).   * Must have decent/good support. * Must strike a perfect balance, allowing me to wear them to the gym for light running/weight lifting AND out on the town with a casual day-to-day outfit.   Ideas? I've found these so far:  [**Adidas Original Dragons**](http://www.amazon.com/adidas-Originals-Dragon-Retro-Sneaker/dp/B004JXWUES/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top)  [**Puma ZDC82**](http://www.amazon.com/ZDC82-Peacoat-Black-Heritage-Trainers-UK/dp/B00DEENV5K/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8 qid=1394861709 sr=8-2 keywords=puma+zdc)
You make great points. And I think the majority of the discussion regarding other people's finances all has to do with percentages. I do understand that some people can buy a mansion like I can buy a Big Mac. I do understand that.   But just because it is difficult to tell when night ends and day begins doesn't mean that we can't know it's midnight.  I think there is an amount of balance and wisdom in the equation. I am not to judge. And I don't really want to. It was just a personal observation and I am fully aware that I might be wrong.  *P.S. Love having the insightful conversation with you /u/BAMF_3.*
http://imgur.com/HsdH9Re  I just met Darby at a creative writing conference. I had no clue that he would even be there. I freaked out when I saw him. We joked about recent Reddit hype. We talked about the future of Assassin's Creed. He let me in on some stuff. Just let me say, we will all be happy by the end of the week.
Great find! I'm going to include this in my post above so we can keep them all together.
I reread my original post. Nowhere did I say that one couldn't give their opinions. Opinions are great things. Opinions are also monumentally different than attempts to overthrow the system and/or force the Creator's/boss's hand.  The Creator opened a vote. Voting is great. You are kind of making my point stronger (thanks). If people vote democracy, democracy rules. If people vote anarchy, anarchy rules. But the experiment doesn't fail with or without it. That is my point.  P.S. I live in a world where people whine and complain and do nothing to better their work situation. There are thousands of jobs available in the real world my friend. They are available for the hard worker, for the educated, for the faithful, for the ethical, and for those willing to go out and find a job rather than sit at home on their computer and complain that there aren't any jobs available.
