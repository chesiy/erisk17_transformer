I am Ellen Pao, new CEO of 9gag. AMA!
I believe I can fly.
Candid photo of Lebron and his son watching Rockets/Warriors tonight. He looks just like his father. It's remarkable... http://i.imgur.com/HEfegqC.jpg
Since tonight will be the last gameless night for awhile (and it's the halfway point in the playoffs, so to speak), what are your thoughts on the first two rounds and what are you looking forward to most as the Conference Finals/Lottery start tomorrow?   Today is a good day to pause and reflect.  Lots of positive/negative emotions last night.  Curious what's swimming through people's minds since there isn't an NBA game on tonight.  Thanks and have fun!
What can be done to de-stretch the Boomer avatar as well as Scola?   Awesome subreddit just needs a few little tinkering-fixes and it will be Finals for Pacers!  Edit:  Other pictures next to posts like the NBA logo, etc are stretched as well.  Maybe it's an easy fix in the code?  I'm not a mod (yet) so I'm not sure what to do.  Thanks!
My idea is for a meta film of Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin trying to get Coneheads 2 off the ground.  It explores issues such as crowd-sourcing, product placement (in a different way than how wayne's world did it marvelously), aging stars, new forms of comedy, CG vs props, Aykroyd talking up his Oscar nomination, who really has clout in Hollywood, Lorne Michaels as a gatekeeper, Curtin's built up resentment of Akyroyd for the ignorant slut joke,reboots vs remakes vs one last final hurrah, rights to the characters, etc etc.  It doesn't really start with Dan and Jane wanting to do the movie, it just kind of blossoms over time and they ride the wave, attempting to get off the wave from time to time, etc.  There would be multiple scripts for the Coneheads sequel, and about 3/5th of the way in, it would get even more meta as all of a sudden the projector would screw up (kind of like the muppets movie) and we realize that the Dan/Jane movie is a movie within another movie that we're watching about trying to get a movie about Dan/Jane making Coneheads 2.  And the producers having problems with marketing that film and reshoots, ethics of using unused Farley footage, and what is too ironic/complicated, etc.  I would have story and screenplay credits as well as an executive producer credit.     Edit: Spelling and whatnot
Which teams will absolutely, positively not reach a Super Bowl within the next 5 years and why?   I want your 'No Guts No Glory' picks for teams you know deep down are not appearing in one of the next 5 Super Bowls.  Sure you can give us your scrub picks of teams that everyone is positive won't make it...  but I want your interesting choices as well and WHY you don't think they will appear in a Super Bowl over the next 5 years.  Have fun and show your work!
Which are the best buffets, brunches, and/or all-you-can eat places in the Indy area?   There are some obvious gems like Sushi Club, Edelweiss' buffet days, Spice Nation, etc.  Curious as to which others you guys know about, love, etc.  Edit:  Feel free to share pertinent details such as what they offer, if only certain days/times, if it is all-you-can-eat, vegan, price, etc.  (if you happen to know them)
Which facts and opinions about your team would piss off your fanbase the most?   Feel free to back up your facts with evidence.  Feel free to back up your opinions with facts and evidence.  Be honest and have fun!  Edit:  Your facts and opinions can 'depress' your fanbase if you want as well.  'Piss off' is just a suggestion.  Looking for negative emotions.
Who would you like to see play QB for one NFL game and why? (caveat: They cannot be an NFL quarterback.)   They may currently be in the NFL, a star Point Guard in the NBA, your parents' mailman, one of the Olsen twins...  Doesn't matter.  Just pick someone who isn't an NFL quarterback and tell us why you'd like to see them play.  Edit:  Feel free to pick the teams that play and describe what you'd think would happen.
Which single sentence can piss off the most Redditors?   Edit:  Obviously, OP deserves Gold for this.  #SWAGYOLOCOPTER420HOLLA
What is the worst thing you've ever done at work?   Something you did by accident, did on purpose, were told to do by your superior, have to do daily, etc.  Just the worst thing you've done at any job you've ever had.  Doesn't have to be work-related.  Just something you did 'at work'.  Edit:  Quite the overwhelming response!  Made me realize what a model employee I am, though still searching for a full-time writing position.  Maybe I don't have a scandalous enough work history to be hired yet.  Back to applications.  Thanks for the thousands of laughs, gasps, and cringes.
[Request] Tia Carrere in Wayne's World's Camera One/Camera Two Scene   I think it's one of the more beautiful/playful/romantic shots.  Just her smiling and laughing going back and forth.  Here's a clip I found on youtube, though there may be better clips online or perhaps you have the DVD.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74M0hPAeFHs  Grazie!!!

You're welcome and thank you.  Peace would be nice.
It's actually a reoccurring problem.  Previous friends of previous girlfriends have tried to get me to have sex with them.  (Unsuccessfully.)  And the reverse has definitely happened a few times where male friends of mine (who obviously aren't friends of mine anymore) tried to get my then girlfriend to sleep with them.  It always seems to start with Facebook.  A friend of my girlfriend will friend me and occasionally IM me to see what's going on and start getting really chatty and friendly.  Perhaps I shouldn't list Secretary as one of my favorite films.  That seems to give them an icebreaker.
