Yeah, me too. I've done extensive work since taking over here, both on liquors and beers. Great wine list, always had been, but nothing new or innovative with either beer or liquor. Trying to change that for the better. (This month has been Small Town's Not Your Fathers Root Beer. Sold like a barn afire.)

Depends on where in Florida you're going. The state of Florida has a rich history, with many different museums focusing on the different places in history that Florida has figured. From Ocean Pond in Olustee, in the north, site of one of only two Civil War battles fought in Florida, and certainly the bloodiest, to the Seminole Rez outside of Okeechobee, in the south, home of the last survivors of the Seminole Indians, a proud race that never submitted to the US.  Cape Canaveral and Kennedy Space Station in the mid-east of the state is America's Space Station. Can't go wrong there!   On the mid-west coast, you have everything from the Ringling Museum in Sarasota to the Dali in St. Petersburg. Ft. Desoto, south of Tampa Bay, is an post-Augustine-era defense fort where you can learn about the first Europeans in Florida.   Or just check out St. Augustine itself...in the northeast, site of possibly one of the oldest European presences on the state. (There is some evidence that Turnbull's site in New Smyrna Beach might be the oldest.)  This isn't even close to an all-inclusive list. Anywhere that you look in Florida, you will find some history. You might want to narrow your trip down, and then check the county website for the area(s) you are interested in visiting.

Can you help me with my anniversary gift this year?   My wife and I have been married four years tomorrow. Flowers are the traditional gift, but giving each other dead (dying anyway) blooms has not been our thing. So here's what I want to do. I'm going to do a DIY with the kids; four pint glasses, etched, with decorative hangers to make a small flower garden for the wall. Here's where you can help me. I don't have a brown thumb but it's not exactly green either. What do I need to know for small container flowers like this, and what's the best flowering plants for such a small container. (I live in East Central FL, indoors is not air-conditioned often)
I'm glad it's not just me. I like the editing/translating of articles in the target language aspect of Duolingo, but other than that I struggle to stay interested in the site. Many of the sentences just don't make sense, and it adds another level of disconnect...I have found in real conversations with people in my target language I can make some educated guesses about the content based on what a normal person might say, and the way a normal person would construct sentences, and that becomes part of my learning when I find my assumptions are correct, I can file away another word or phrase I don't know, as opposed to trying to guess why someone would say something so ridiculous as your sentence examples show.  What do you think about Memrise? It's user generated, so the good is with the bad there, but I use that site far more than Duolingo recently.
Thank you for that injection of ultrafunk into my otherwise boring day. You guys rip.   Unrelated, but I checked out a couple videos of  yours on the Tube, (I really liked that Byrd cover, BTW) and eventually I got to a point where all the recommended videos on the right side were 9/11 conspiracy films...
Yeah, I'm a fan of that one.  I don't know what to tell you; I feel that it's worth reading through. More things happen towards the last half, good things, great stories, but the overall feel of the novel won't change. At its heart, it's just a story about a dude and the things that happen in his life.  Read it. Give it another couple chapters. I think you'll get more into it.
I'm terribly guilty of this, but I rarely waste food.  I like to shop without recipes/meals in mind...that helps me make value based decisions. Instead of going to the market and hoping to find a good price on a particular cut of meat, I can go to the market and find the best deals and worry about production later.  I also like the challenge of coming up with new meals every day (that I get to prepare meals at home). It's a nice game to play. Got to pull something out to thaw sometime after lunch, and that gives me about four hours to figure out what I'm going to do with it.  Saying that, I also don't buy "rare" items and/or speciality or expensive items without having some idea what I'll be doing with it later, and if something goes too long in the freezer without being used, well into the crockpot you go, and poof! STEW!
Now here's a food label that I'd like to see.

Really, just one more than I have now.  Every independent listener, (not a repeat offender) makes me happy. I don't have a large count out there, but that's not the reason that I do this. All this work, all this time, all this fun, is because I *have* to do it, I don't have a choice. Finding out that someone out there likes what I do, at least enough to listen, is an additional reward.  tl;dr I ain't greedy. Just listen to it.

You Should Know about Snopes.com, an internet rumor-busting site.   In talking to my coworkers about a few things that are patently false on the internet (surprise!) I realized that many people apparently do not know about this place. [Snopes.com](http://www.snopes.com/) is a great resource to find out the truthiness of just about anything that you find on the internet.

I went to see him in Tallahassee. Couple of good friends, a whole lotta whiskey, prepped for a great night.  Got there early, decent seats, smaller venue. Gonna be a good show.  Opening act comes out.  Blown away. It's The Derek Trucks Band. (Here's a favorite of mine, [I'd Rather be Blind, Crippled, and Crazy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSbcpLLadX0), it's got a 15 second no-skip ad, but it's the best live version of that song that I know of. L 6:22)  Stole the show. Outstanding performer, super fun show.  Almost forgot that Eric Johnson was up next. His show, while still amazing, was far less satisfactory for me compared to the discovery (for me) of this new thing.  Unfortunately, I suppose I left that night less of a fan Eric Johnson. I still like what he does a bunch, and this song is my favorite of his.
Good luck my friend. I'm well into my second year of attempting to quit. Two weeks ago, right about when you started quitting, I had well manicured nails, longer than I wanted them. (Got in the way of playing guitar, and I kept cutting myself with them!) I had a rough night, and without really thinking about it, chewed/gnawed/gnarled/ripped/bit/crunched every millimeter of them away.  This was probably the fourth or fifth time that this happened.  Take it day by day, and don't give up, because you will probably backslide a time or two.   Seriously, good luck to you, and everyone else fighting this ridiculous habit. There is every reason in the world to not do this. So do it. Do it for cosmetic reasons, because we know what our fingers look like; that's why we hide them. Do it for the health of your hands. You're two weeks in, probably no infections or redness anymore? It's nice, isn't it? Keep at it.
A smile.   Seriously. Whether it's sexy short skirts, or a long skirt and no undies, or sweat pants and tank top like Panda said, the most important thing is confidence and fun.  For me, just the smile, when we get home, please. I don't need anything else.
Would also add a big hurdle for me to jump over, and hard lesson learned..  You are never "done" writing a song.  I've changed my songs over and over and over again. Each time I play it, it seems like I see an opportunity to improve the message the lyrics were trying to convey, or a slightly more fitting guitar phrase that fits the mood of the song.   I have songs that I've been working on since a teenager, and while my friends from high school would probably recognize the song that I play for them, they would also recognize that it's nothing like the one they heard the first time, oh so long ago.
Father of two, boy 8, girl 5.  A lot of the behavior that you talk about when he was visiting the lab seems pretty normal to me, or at least age appropriate. My boy is not real "hands on" with new stuff, but he loves to learn new things and be around new things. I think that if he went to work with his uncle (not a scientist (how cool!) but road construction) he would love all the machines and cool stuff, but might be leery of actually getting involved. Some boys are different, and would be all kinds of hands on, to the point of seeming like mania.  The defiance could be described as normal for his age group as well. This is the time that they start to understand themselves, and he may be pushing the boundries to see what he can get away with. How's the mom and dad at home? If they're allowing this behavior to go unchecked or are unwilling disciplanarians, they might be fostering these sorts of problems. (When you describe impatience for future goals/rewards and change of situational difficulties, it sounds like he's maybe not getting negative reinforcement of these behaviors at home.)  The scaredness, (or timidness) that I sensed you were talking about might be something that you should watch. It could mean a lot of different things; from the relatively normal i.e. he's just sensitive/timid, to the relatively severe i.e. he's got something either real or imaginary to be scared of, and is acting on these feelings.  Overall, he sounds kinda like a normal eight year old boy to me, assuming all developmental skills are about where they are supposed to be.   How's the relationship in between the boy and his parents? Are they stern enough in their demands about his diet, his habits, his bedtime ritual? Or are they enabling his bad behavior by not being resolute? Did this behavior maybe start as a reaction to the new child in the house? Hopefully there's no overt favortism between the two children. Without knowing much more, I can be of no help, but overall, outside of the timidness/anxiety he doesn't sound that much different from my boy.
Right there with you. I brought it up to my wife, and she's given it a go a few times, but she says it's not her thing. Makes her happy to see me have a good time, but can't get her to initiate without having to almost beg. I think it's maybe more taboo for a female to be on the giving end of anal than it is to be on the receiving?...either way, it still makes me happy, and every now and then is better than never now or then, right?
Profit above all else...but most people don't see past the pictures on the front of the box.   I've been working with the Anaphalaxis Network on getting together some alternative menus for our guests with food allergies, and the one thing that I've learned that stands out is that if you are trying to limit or eliminate one macroingredient from your diet, it's damn near impossible. Things are misleading, mislabled, recipes change and the packaging doesn't...these people don't care about their customers, they just care about dollars...just dollars.

[Favor]...r/dg, I come with my hat in my hands...   In the spirit of the upcoming Arbitrary Day, I seek the help of my fellow Redditors and Discers.   My wife and I took a couple of friends out to beautiful [Tuscawilla Disc Golf Course](http://www.dgcoursereview.com/course.php?id=98) to play a friendly round with a couple of our buddies.  You ever have that game where nothing really goes right? Or left? My wife had that game. And on the signature [hole #7](http://www.google.com/imgres?q=tuscawilla+disc+golf+hole+7 hl=en biw=1024 bih=616 tbm=isch tbnid=ZRm7d6vpuf3NeM: imgrefurl=http://discjag.blogspot.com/2009/07/tuscawilla-park-in-daytona-beach-fl.html docid=YgsrrwZ1FatbeM imgurl=http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9MfYZehXfoI/SnIQEZEKecI/AAAAAAAAAOU/DNvOdVLAQXo/s400/tuscawilla_hole7_basket.jpg w=400 h=300 ei=Uz38T6aeFYWO8wSms-zcBg zoom=1 iact=hc vpx=282 vpy=114 dur=5281 hovh=194 hovw=259 tx=118 ty=117 sig=111693889434370404481 page=1 tbnh=131 tbnw=175 start=0 ndsp=15 ved=1t:429,r:6,s:0,i:91) my wife put not one, but both of her drivers in the lake. A rare pink pro Beast, and her favorite Millenium Astra.  This park will recover discs, I think, but it could be awhile, months even, before they turn up in the local seller's trailer. (She does have name and number on them.) This leaves my wife without drivers to play...and we play two to three times a week.   So here's my problem...we're so broke lately we can't even pay attention...and I just don't know if I can free up the money to replace those discs. Maybe two weeks from now, I might be able to pick something up in a DX for her, but it will be a bit before I can get her some quality plastics again.  DG is such a great way for us to get out, and our kids love the time spent in the park, and it pains me to see my wife in such foul spirits after losing her two favorite discs, and not be able to do anything about it.  So here's my begging....if any of you have an extra driver laying around, something you're tired of seeing, or just a disc that you feel needs someone who will love it, learn with it, and try to keep it out of lakes, please PM me and let me know you can help.  I would be willing to reimburse shipping, but like I said before, we're way broke and it might be a minute, but I do pay my debts, or if you're interested in trade, my wife is quite the crafty one. (Here's some [bag tags](http://www.reddit.com/tb/vosw5) that we made for our little start up club.)....maybe we could work something out in trade?   At the very least, thanks for taking the time to listen to the lament of amateurs who can't keep their discs out of the water...lol. (I've been in that lake a time or two as well, but on the edge...she sank **both** of them in the middle.)  Happy discing!
