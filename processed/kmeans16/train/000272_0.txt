Land Before Time is one I battled over for my own list
I know what you mean, should've made it top 10 at least!
What's your Top 5 favourite animated films?   Seeing a lot if these going around lately and got curious!   *Give Reasons?* It's fun to discuss!  **1.** The Lion King **2.** Beauty and the Beast **3.** Princess Mononoke **4.** The Iron Giant **5.** Toy Story   The majority of this list is because I've been watching them since I was a small child. But as I've grown up I appreciate the deeper themes, especially in The Lion King and Toy Story.   Princess Mononoke introduced me to Studio Ghibli at a later age, and I love the art, the action and the mythology!
1) Star Wars V: The Empire Strikes Back 2) The Lion King 3) Shawshank Redemption  4) Pokemon The Movie: 2000 5) Django Unchained
Thanks, definitely using this chart! And will check out everything you suggested and your post :)
Thanks, looked them all up and they all seem really interesting so I'm adding them to my list :D
Thanks, just looked up Dragon Tiger Gate, looks interesting :D

Thanks, forgot about checking the Criterion!
Thanks, I used to watch death note when I was younger (15/16), and I don't mind gore, so I'll be sure to look up Living Hell and Battle Royale.   I've never watched foreign comedies, does the humour translate well over subs? Or would it be best to search for a dubbed version?
How do you deal with different reactions (positive/negative) to your cosplays and other professional photo shoots that you do? (meaning underwear ect). I'm guessing most people/fans will be happy with your work but is it difficult at times when there are people simply "hating" or "trolling" on your page in an effort to put down the great work you do?
