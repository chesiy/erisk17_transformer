Battery life on Nexus 5 suddenly amazing
Thanks for pointing out Aqua Nueva! The quote is actually referring to one of their other restaurants, Aqua Kyoto, but I agree that it's a little confusing. I'll edit the quote tonight. In the future if you come across something you'd like to edit you can click the 'edit' button in the bottom right hand corner and submit a change :)  Adding a full menu is definitely on my to-do list. I don't suppose you know a nice API that is able to provide restaurant menu's? I think there are a few out there which I'll review once I've made a few other changes.  Thanks a lot for your feedback,  Joe
I've just released Food Finder: a place for foodies to find and share amazing restaurants (London only). I want to create an incredible UX - I need as much feedback as possible!   Hey everyone,   I've just released [Food Finder](http://www.foodfinder.io) into an incredibly crowded space. There are a couple of things I want to achieve with [Food Finder](http://www.foodfinder.io) to make it different to the competition.   They are:  * Every restaurant on [Food Finder](http://www.foodfinder.io) needs to be amazing  * [Food Finder](http://www.foodfinder.io) will be powered by the foodie community by enabling users to post great restaurants to the site  * I want to make an incredible user experience similar to City Mapper where things are simple and just work.  There's still quite a way to go and [Food Finder](http://www.foodfinder.io) has only been released in London so far but I'd love your feedback on the user experience and any advice on the best way to grow the community of foodies.    Thanks,  Joe   Name: Food Finder  URL: [foodfinder.io](http://www.foodfinder.io)  My Bio:  I'm a VC, physicist and (weekend) entrepreneur living and working in London. Food Finder was originally a weekend project but has been adopted by a lot of my friends. Now I want to grow the community and improve the platform.
