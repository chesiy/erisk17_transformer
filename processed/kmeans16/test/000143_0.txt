1. That link doesn't show a comment made by me. Get your shit straight before you try to use something against someone.  2. Why do YOU care so much? All I said was read the sidebar, and you dug through my comment history until you found something to launch a personal attack with.   3. I don't pretend to have power anywhere. I don't have any interest in being a mod. My interest is keeping r/nosleep safe from impotent goons like you who exist solely to start fights.

I totally get it. I describe the inside of my head as a fish tank bubble machine. I'd absolutely love to know more but all in your time, as you're ready. :)
I would love to know more!
In real life I'm actually a super kind and understanding person. What irks me is that all of a sudden society has to cowtow to weakness. I've seen trigger warnings in college syllabi. I think that's absolutely ludicrous. Real life doesn't come with trigger warnings. There's not gonna be someone to warn you if you're about to walk out the door to see an assault and no one is going to cover your eyes when you see bad things happening. I think that instead of letting the fear and "triggers" win, people who can't handle it should get the help they need from a professional and learn coping skills.
It's true. I wasn't saying they were the same thing, necessarily, just that there were similarities it might have helped OP to read. On how to deal with it, etc.
It's funny you mention that. Where I grew up it's very conservative and exactly as you said, less colorful. Even the lesbians fit into gender roles, you know? Femme and butch. Unfortunately there's really nothing in the world that makes me melt like a good strong butch and they just don't exist here.
What is ftfy?
Holy shit dude. It already happened once? Talk to your parents again, see if you can get someone to watch her during the day. I dog sit, but I'm betting you're too far away for me to help you.
Take that bottle of ink you gathered to a police man okay? Tell him where you found it and that daddy is uspet about it and that Maisey is gone away. He'll have special stuff to get it out of the carpet with.
Anyone else read this, hoping for the mold?
It could just be me. It's habit to look for messages. It's just that they're so well written any mistake seems deliberate, you know? In Back In The Alley there's a place where it says "of" but it should say "some." Also in that one, 6th paragraph, there's the word "bar" but the "a" is missing. If you come up with anything else, can you let me know?
Hey OP any news? You doing alright?
It is SO not your fault. Accidents happen. You didn't do anything wrong. Also, I'm sorry you're having a hard time with your transition. It's this awful cycle where being in the wrong body makes you depressed and being depressed makes you unsuitable for T and surgery, which makes you more depressed, etc. I hope you hang in there OP. Feel free to PM me if you wanna talk. I have a little experience. Not in the dead guy department but in the trans department.
Thanks for clarifying that.  Can I ask though, now that it's done, have you got any clarity as to why you did it?
