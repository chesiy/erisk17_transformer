Hm, probably have man hands on that keyboard.
I think your handsome in a 'professor' looking kind of way.  I like the beard, goes good with your shaved head and the glasses are nice.  Maybe consider making an appointment with your family doctor and telling him how you feel?
I've read what you had to say, re watched the video and you're right, he did point to the side walk area.  I stand corrected.  I don't know if he was necessarily deliberately getting her out of the view of the camera or if he simply wanted to deal with her off the roadway.  Either way, you're correct, he told her to go over there.

I'm an ex smoker.  Smoking is fucking filthy.
...but operating a black market gambling operation does
You didn't see through the hyperbole?  The cops actually took the time to find the wife to tell her to go back to the house and unlock the door, so they didn't have to kick the door in.
I read the entire story.  He never once advised he was declaring the income to the IRS.  Even more damning, I now see he tweaked his suggestion, that on top of the winners, he recommended **all participants** gift him 10%.  If you think he was paying tax on his gambling operation, I've some swamp land in Florida I'd like to sell you.
Did you know you can't grow a weed free lawn without chemical herbicides and regular watering?  So screw it.  Let the weeds grow and my days of toiling over that little patch of grass and spending hundreds of dollars are over.  I have a Japanese lilac tree, columbrian maple tree and a hybrid Apple tree + 3 pyramid cedars + 2 lilac bushes, one of which is a beautiful 10 feet tall.    That's plenty of oxygen.  My kids play at the park.
I thought nothing existed outside the universe?  Which means there's an end, no?
You're not responsible for unauthorized CC transactions, so no need to worry.
That's a short haired woman.
The NDP **will never** hold office unless they shed their socialist, big government  spending  roots.  I am a member and regular donor to the NDP and am both pleasantly surprised and thrilled at the direction our future PM is taking the party.  If you want to win, you must campaign from the centre, as you will lure both centre right and centre left undecided voters that are necessary for a win.  Do you want change or do you want more Harper?  If you want change, follow Mulcairs lead.  Edit - For my party, the fringe left ( which is in abundance on/r/Canada) does as much harm to it, as the fringe right does to Harpers brand.  I know, the truth hurts.  If I wanted to turn an undecided voter off my party, I'd sent her to /r/Canada.
What are they protesting?
I've  a theory, some people like some things  and other people like different things.
Empty?  No.
Negligent.  Losing track of a loaded magazine is negligent.  Negligence;  ' Is a failure to exercise the care that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in like circumstances.'

Five months before she was found hanged in a Texas jail cell, Sandra Bland posted a video on the internet stating she had depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.  http://abc7chicago.com/news/naperville-woman-who-died-in-texas-jail-claimed-depression-ptsd/855439/
Why does a flat earth need to be discussed?  Do you discuss whether or not the delusions of a schizophrenic are real?
Ok
His proof is unreasonable.  I have life long friends whom I am in no photographs.  People I work with every day, no pictures.  Neighbours I've lived beside for ten years and with whom I socialize, no pictures!  Most 40 year old men don't go around taking pictures of friends, colleagues and neighbours.
It'll be quite straightforward.
If I'm 15 and hundreds of people are collectively mocking me, both strangers and my peers and it's spilling over into school...  That shit's gotta hurt something fierce.  I'm 40 and when I was 15, there was no such thing as people posting a picture of you online and saying horrible shit about your looks and some telling you to kill yourself.  It just wasn't a thing...  And then you say it's the kid being mocked who has the problem and not the vicious people finding pleasure in tearing someone down?
It wasn't always this way.   Seriously, Ive been online since 94. ( interesting you chose that year)  Things have changed and in cases related to disagreement, not for the better.    You can't disagree with popular sentiment on Reddit, else you'll be insulted, ridiculed and cursed at.  It's pretty strange, as people don't act like that in real life.
16 is the age a youth can be kicked out.  You don't believe that there are youths who are so destructive, so abusive, so disruptive and so intent on disrespecting the rules of the home that a parent is not wise to give their child the freedom they so desire by taking away the privilege of living rent free in the home?  I do believe there are unfortunately youths who do in fact deserve to be removed from their homes due to the choices they make and their behaviors.
If you walk in public, you have no expectation of privacy.
In Canada,( where I live) the courts have ruled there is no expectation of privacy in our yards.  Else your neighbor would get arrested for looking into your backyard.  I don't believe cops jerking off in helicopters is a reasonable concern.  To answer your question, you have zero expectation of privacy on city streets.

Semen needs to fertilize an egg.  Semen can never become a human on its own.  I've honestly never heard someone comparing semen to a fetus before.   I'm pro-choice, but your analogy isn't convincing.
I'm happy to see that the police investigated themselves, prosecuted him internally under the PSA, convicted him and then fired him, which was upheld by the OCPC. ( Remember these cases when Canadians claim cops can't investigate themselves)  There **should** be a mechanism in place to suspend officers without pay on a case by case basis.  No such mechanism exists, so dirty and corrupt cops get their top base salary of 90K while they work their way through the system.  So, the government needs to legislate this power, that is currently unavailable to police Chiefs.  The Ontario Association of Chiefs want the ability to suspend with pay on a case by case basis.
No love for that genre, but that video was hilarious.
