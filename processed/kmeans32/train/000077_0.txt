I play this same conversation in my head.
Sex.
The point is it's not real...actually.  I don't REALLY know her at all, and that's by design in the therapeutic relationship.  By feelings are not really for HER.  It's something that I'm projecting onto her that speaks to something in past, that's what we need to get to the bottom of.
I have a crush on my therapist right now.
Ha ha! Yeah come to think of it was usually the same people always doing the interpretations at that church too.
Wow, that's awesome!
I want your job.

Rapidly approaching the one year mark.   I quit August 8th, 2013, and now less than 3 weeks until my one year anniversary of being smoke and nicotine free, I feel like I can breath and that I've broken free of something and completed a task that for years I had deemed "impossible".  A person who never gives up, never fails.
Wow! Amazing seats!

New to python, and forums, interesting question   Ok so you guys probably know my little brother, metulburr, I am train_subject3168. I am pretty new to python and just learning. I'm a computer science major in college at the moment.  Anyway, in a programming structure and logic class I'm in (intro level) in our textbook, the chapter I just read described the bubble sorting algorithm for sorting data, it has flowcharts and pseudocode and I thought I'd try to translate it to python (I'm using python 3.3.4 right now) I have functions for filling an array and sorting the array and then displaying the array, the filling and displaying work now, I still gotta fix the sorting one, but the real question is, my brother was noting that it shoudn't work at all because I have global variables and I use them in my functions, well look at the code:          array_size = 5     scores_array = []     comparisons = array_size - 1     x = 0     y = 0     temp = 0          def fill_array():         x = 0         while (x  array_size):             userinput = input("Enter a score:\n")             userinput = int(userinput)             #for i in range(5):             scores_array.append(userinput)             x = x + 1               def sort_array():         y = 0         while (y  comparisons):             x = 0             while (x  comparisons):                 while (scores_array[x]  scores_array[x + 1]):                     swap()                 x = x + 1             y = y + 1          def swap():         temp = scores_array[x + 1]         scores_array[x + 1] = scores_array[x]         scores_array[x] = temp          def display_array():         x = 0         while (x  array_size):             print(scores_array[x])             x = x + 1          fill_array()          print("\n")          #sort_array()          display_array()  now what is interesting is my brother pointed out to me that the code above runs with no errors, yet the code below throws an error "UnboundLocalError: local variable 'var' referenced before assignment" in this code:          var = 0          def addone():         var += 1          print(var)     addone()     print(var)  Why is this? Does anyone know why the latter code throws the error but the first doesn't?
Praise the Sun!
thanks :)

What i don't get is why I a "loyal" customer have to pay full price for the service, but people who are flaky customers, on again off again, repeatedly get the discounts for introductory offers...why do i stay in business with them?  Bring on Google Fiber, I'm ready for a change.
That's hilarious
