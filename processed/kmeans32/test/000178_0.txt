Interesting that this comes after last weeks rumor about [MS ditching windows phone](http://www.techradar.com/us/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/microsoft-is-about-to-kill-windows-phone-claims-bold-new-rumour-1298038).   Edit: also direct link   ["We plan to narrow our focus to three customer segments where we can make unique contributions and where we can differentiate through the combination of our hardware and software. Well bring business customers the best management, security and productivity experiences they need; value phone buyers the communications services they want; and Windows fans the flagship devices theyll love."](http://news.microsoft.com/2015/07/08/satya-nadella-email-to-employees-on-sharpening-business-focus/)

I'll only support this kind of thinking if it also applies to rubberneckers on the highway.   If you slow down to look, you might as well have caused that crash, ticket please.
