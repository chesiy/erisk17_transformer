Your name says it all.
Yea you're right ofcourse but it just seems impossible to go. I mean i have 2 hours left until my bus leaves, basicly pulled an allnighter and my mom is also awake already telling me she will chop my head off if i don't go because she doesn't have enough money to pull me through all of this, which is true. Yet i'm convinced that i won't go. I really don't think i have the potential to be honest because right now im just acting like a self-destructive child who is also a big burden to his mom and whole family. Maybe i'm just still too egoistical... And i might not even care...fuck
Could have, would have, should have...
I don't think you win 7 games in a row by being sloppy.
Hearthstone is one of those games where i feel like it's not really worth all the grinding and trouble to hit that legend rank. The only reward is that cardback which looks really meh imo and it doesn't give you enough bragging rights compared to what you can get in games like WoW, LoL and even SC when you put in the time and effort. Everyone who thinks it's worth i wish you best of luck but in the end I've decided against it. Cheers
HIKUUUUU
That's just me. Always jumping to conclusions. :(
How can you tell?
Who is Apdo v1 on EUW?
First time im doing this fantasy thingy. The other guy had no chance to begin with :p http://imgur.com/P5gcnwX
It's always like this in the early season. Hype gets created and as the season goes on and LCS ends the hype is gone. I mean teams are still figuring out how to optimally play the game so anything can happen and any team can look strong(UoL). Atleast the games are super fun to watch.

[Photek - The Third Sequence](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esHpGuBkGys)  [Xtrah - Soundclash](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XN6t-HF8yk)  [Octane  DLR feat. Script - Set Up The Set](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QpKaYVbtuQ)   ...aaaaaand some unreleased stuff:  [I Am Legion - Make Those Move (Teddy Killerz Remix)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4P_lwiH9Hs)  Also look out for the record label Critical Music. They are putting out some real deep, intelligent but also dark tunes. And they sound more stylized and less muddy and hardcore than most of the dark dnb tracks, what i like.
