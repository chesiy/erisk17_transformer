MONKFISH
I need to meet these men.
I slept with my best friends step dad when I was 20. He was in my college town for business. Always was attracted to him. He would always randomly hand us $100 in high school and on vacations and shit.  He was handsome, wealthy and I never really thought of him as her 'father/step father'. It happened and it was amazing. When she found out, she laughed. Said I wasn't the only one who had thought about it. But I was the only one to do it. She wasn't upset. Still isn't. We see one another weekly. I guess I got off easy. I still see him randomly, but I am in an amazing happy relationship.    EDIT: When I said "We see one another weekly." I mean my friend. Not him. I am in a great relationship.
GLORIOUS!
This has to be the funniest shit I have seen in FOREVER
Very interesting, thank you!
I can see the eye. It blends right in like it belongs in the darkness. When I noticed it I felt a huge weight in my chest.    I cannot say I am a professional psychic/medium but I do know I have abilities and many "professionals" have shared that same information with me.   Try saging the house. All corners, door ways, every room including the attic. This can be done at any time, if you are more comfortable with the daylight do it then. Say something to bless the house and be rid of the spirits. Send them on their way to the actual afterlife. Another thing that I do whenever staying somewhere new, hotel, house, whatever- salt. Salt gets rid of negative energy. Windowsills, door ways and EVERY CORNER.
He's awesome!
I work at a 4.5 star restaurant. We feature tons of amazing craft beers and wine on tap. This is one of our featured beers of the month.

It is a cyst. I'm not an esthetician or anything but have gone numerous times to get those removed, I stopped going because I love popping things so I do it myself. I pierce the skin with a sewing needle after sanitizing it and it has to go through the layer of skin and the sack the cyst is in. It will hurt. Then squeeze. The process is a little painful and if your not grossed out easily I suggest you do it yourself. Sometimes they just explode when you least expect if so I do it myself so it doesn't happen at the wrong time. Hope that helped a little.
