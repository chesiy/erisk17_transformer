[**Here's the video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-IWRd3YKoc) I just uploaded with a timelapse of this colorization.    I discovered this amazing subreddit a few days ago and instantly subscribed, I absolutely love the photos posted here. Please tell me where do you think I can improve and tips, and what do you think looks good, it would be of great help!
Holy shit
Apparently [he is a real reverend who's wife died](http://www.kwwl.com/story/29413353/2015/06/25/man-says-letter-telling-him-to-kill-himself-was-put-in-his-car), I find it hard he would write that, but who knows, it's entirely possible. I believe it's.l more likely some idiot troll kid or just some idiot troll left it there to mess with him and hurt the guy.
Thanks a lot! I will :)
You fucking piece of shit. You are part of the problem that the Internet is objectified in this world. Have some sympathy for a REAL Redditor with a HORRIBLE autistic problem and stop being such a jackdaw. This is someone's SJW or stalker. This comment will probably not do anything to change you from being so rude but I want you to think if this is really the type of user you want to be.
Well, towards the end of the 90s (1998) it was discovered that the expansion of the universe is (very contrary to the belief in that time) occurring at an accelerating rate. Before that it was thought that galaxies moved away from each other more slowly as time passed, but since 1998 we know it's not, they move away faster and faster, and will continue to do so. One of the most accepted theories to explain this weird effect from the universe is the Dark Energy Theory, but it's 1:15am here and I'm about to sleep, so I'll leave that to another redditor or go into it a bit more tomorrow.
It costs 200 dollars. Remember that it spawns on helipads and parking lots, usually not more than 1,3km away from your char. That's cool.    Personally I'm now going for the new sports car (can't recall the name), I love how it looks and sounds. I already have a Kuruma, a Hydra, and had multiple cars in the middle that I bought and eventually sold. When I get it I don't know what I'm going to get.
Frankly when I'm stoned everything surprises and amazes me, woahdude doesn't even have to come up with great stuff to accomplish that but they do, I always leave that sub with my mind blown
I honestly would fuck the fuck out of her if she was my fucking mom. Imagine going into the kitchen and that slut is making a fucking mermelade, stearing and shit, putting on some godly lemon juice in it, and that amazing ass is bursting out some fucking yoga pants and you don't go to school because your fucking tummy ached so she gives you a mermelade covered blowjob and there's fucking cum all over everywhere, the gardener just watches in silence and cries for your fucking lost innocence a bit but that's alright because he kind of likes it a little bit and lets you play with his tools    Fuck man I'd love to have her as my mom

Yes
Of course, I'm from Argentina.
Thanks so much! I'm super glad you loved it!
Thanks! Indeed this is a lens effect. The lens in question is a Nikkor 10,5mm f/2.8 **Fisheye**, and I bold that because those are the type of lenses that have this particular bending. They also make far things seem smaller and closer thing bigger.
I read your username and thought you were a novelty account that just wrote comments in caps lock, "shouting". I was disappointed.
Haha, calling someone gay on the internet. Classic.
You're right.    Isn't it perfect that it was voiced by Steven Ogg though? Like in, Steve-O?
Buenisimo! Ah agrego. Hace mucho entraba muy seguido a 3dg y era bastante activo, por ah reconozco a un par. Mi user de ahi es Nikolai. (con punto al final)
Alguien juega al GTA Online ac?   Pregunto porque estara copado hacer una crew de argentinos, ciertas misiones requieren mucha coordinacin y con los yanquis a veces se me complica un toque el tema de hablar por mic, tengo una pronunciacin medio chota y de ltima estara copadsimo poder hablar en espaol y que todos entendamos bien.
You think wrong, I've never believed we were in the right to reclaim them, mainly because they have been occupied for about 190 years now, it doesn't make much sense. If you do some reading you'll find out that the war in 82 was only by and for the dictatorial government to remain in power longer, they actually never had the desire to regain the islands.
This is fucking incredible
Aparently no, or someone did and thought it was funny and said nothing. Of course the media did and it was all over the news the day after.  The best part was that they kept running it. I searched it but couldn't find it, I don't remember which province was it. If I find it I'll post it here.  EDIT: HA! Found it. 00:19 is where it's at.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Nrcd0Czu4
The fun kind
I clean my cheese with it
Jesus also existed, just not the part with all the magic powers and stuff. He was just a cool dude.
What an incredible, gorgeous movie. I'm so glad Nolan picked up so many things from it for Interstellar. In the slight chance that someone in this subreddit doesn't know where that quote is from, it's from Contact, a film from 1997.
/r/conspiratard mejor dicho
Es que claro, me llama la atencin como a vos... *Qu pas con este tipo?* O sea, es un flaco que al parecer lleg lejos con su carrera, en el sentido que logr cosas grosas, fue respetado, tiene una trayectoria considerable, o sea que MUY BOLUDO no puede ser, o al menos eso querra creer... Pero de repente empieza a twittear pelotudeces que se interpretan como el orto y que hasta un mono entrenado se da cuenta que son impublicables. Es raro.
What I love about /r/trees   This is a slow sub. And not because of quantity of suscribers, but because the majority of us are all fucking stoned.  A post can stay in the frontpage for an entire day, maybe two, reaching it with ~200 karma and ending up with +2000. We take our time to read, to see, to comment and to vote.  I love you, Ents.
Tonight I couldn't sleep. I need to tell you why.   Well, this is my first post in /r/nosleep. I hope I'll be able to express myself well, since English isn't my first language.           I was thinking, almost meditating, about distances between us people, and how the technology now easily available in every home allows us to connect us and debate instantly about ideas and conceptions. That's admirable, and it's something to remember and charish. Let's not take it for granted.            But also, on the other hand, at the same time a lot of people can not access to this technologies and therefore is marginated from that community, geting behind in human evolution pace. And, a lot of them can not tell us their realities such as we can, and must be in dark places and needing our help, but without getting it. And it made me sad, to think of all those people, departed from their beloveds, kidnapped girls, war prisoners, war victims in the middle east, everyone and everything that you love, gone.                  And that made me wonder about my beloved ones, my house, my things. My life. What if, say 2 to 3 years from now, some political debate gets into a discussion, and then into an issue, and then, into a international complaint, and then, into a war. And its a war with your country, and another very threatening one. And this is ALL from a trouble that to this day, did not exist. Maybe it'll originate tomorrow, but, there's a chance that in 3 years, you will be in that situation.                                              With your beloved ones gone. Imagine your neighrhood, destroyed, your family killed brutally by bombs and bullets of high .cal, your sons and brothers, and fathers, burned and mutilated. Imagine them, with their faces and their voices gone. You knowing that you wouldn't see them anymore, hear them anymore, hug them anymore. Feel them anymore, not ever again. Your pets, all killed as well, you and a few people you know and members of your family survived, but the hunt isn't over yet and you may be the next victim. Or your left beloved ones.                  So, this is something that seems far from true, and we say ourselves that it doesn't actually seems like something that could happen, so, I'm tranquile and I sleep well that way, not thinking about it. But, it could, it HAS, it IS (in other country, to people like you and me), in it WILL BE in some point, another great war.                                  It may not be violent war, with bombs, nukes and airplanes, it could be a echonomical war, which then ends in you and your family in poverty, dying from hunger and great recesion, or a civic war, or I don't know. We, as humans, know that in time, shamefully it's going to happen.                  And now, us that can seen it before it happening, need to do something. But we can't. It's not up to us.                      It's NOT up to us. It's up to THEM.                  And THEY will decide if its your country's turn, my country's turn, or someone else's country turn. We just have to wait and... see.              *Keep a good ear for the bangs and booms.*          EDIT: a word
[All seasons spoilers] What I LOVE about GoT.   Ever since Season 1, when they're about to kill Eddard I was thinking "OK, he's going to get saved, obviously, any moment now... any moment... wait... what?", and so I learned that this show is not like any other show, or books for that matter.  What I mean is that I never expected to so much main characters to die, and this is something positive for me, because although I do not wish them to die, but to win and live happy forever (well, not quite, but you get my point), I enjoy the thrill of fights and challenges the characters face, because now I know that they CAN die. In any other shows, they won't die, they will only get CLOSE to dying and they'll be saved in the last second, and you get the thrill of suspense in fights and the not knowing, but you kinda expect that they will end up victoriously. But not here.  For example, when I watched last night's episode (S04E09), I was tense through the whole thing, and that's because Martin isn't afraid to kill a main character. I knew Jon could die any moment there, it was a real possibility, and that filled me with excitment. Again, I wanted him to "win" and that things ended well, and that's the same reason why I got so hyped up: because I knew the chance of that not happening was a real thing.  I like this feature a lot. It's like a double edged sword: on one hand, I get to see the characters for which I developed certain amount of affection get slaughtered, but on the other, I get the thrill and excitement of death and the "bad guys winning".  Sorry for bad english!
[SPOILER] What is it that Marty smells when he enters the house, when looking for Errol's sister?   Couldnt figure that out. I'm talking about this http://i.imgur.com/aX7t395.jpg  You can even see the pinetree carscents hanging (to soften the rotten smell I guess), I highlighted them in the third column.     *Sorry for bad english*
