Bartender: Order your whole round at the beginning. If I've just made 4 espresso martinis then I can't just "quickly add" a 5th.
eeek so inappropriate.   "Most people with pedophilic tendencies never harm a child, knowing it is wrong. These people need support and encouragement to stay strong."

I like food, booze and memes.
Glad I clicked.

Don't try to make friends at uni. I'm about to finish my 4 years and I'm not taking a single friend with me. If it happens, cool, but don't plan on having 'buddies from college' when you are 50.    If you're confused about what to do, take 6 months off. Work, travel if you have the means. Working full time, even as a bartender or waitress will make you enough money to be able to save so maybe you can alleviate some of the financial pressure.    But that's all based on my experience. Different strokes for different folks.
Anything where people sing and are judged.
Creole and Americana food is getting huge in Brisbane. Its tasty. Not too foreign from what we're used to.
Hello fellow Aussie.
Yesterday I failed to make three baskets in a row. Turned around to my friends, said "I suck at this." and threw the ball behind me.    Through the hoop, nothin' but net. I strut everywhere for the rest of the day.
Its my real name. I was new to Reddit. I realize now how stupid my choice was.
My brother broke his neck a few years ago and has not cut his bright red hair since. Then he put dreadlocks in it.  So when people ask how he is going I put on a really sad voice and demeanor and say   "Oh man, it's  been really hard on the whole family but we are getting through it together. Living with someone disabled isn't easy but its something I've had accept. My brother is a cripple: He's a white dude with dreads."  They laugh and I don;t have to go through the fucking story again.

Hey man, I hope you don't feel humiliated anymore. My bro broke his neck and was in a spinal unit too. Everyone there shits themselves. He's out now and still occasionally shits the bed. We just tell him not to worry and wash the sheets. If your people don't understand your medical condition leads to you sometimes having accidents then you need new people.
Does this work for girls too? I'll try it next time I jerk it to confirm but anyone else out there?
Met my ex 2 weeks before I was leaving the country to live in England for a year.   6 months later he came over to visit me, took me to Amsterdam, Paris and Ireland.  We were staying in a castle in Ireland when I told me he loved me and I lost my virginity to him while Rocky Horror Picture Show played in the background.   I got the guts up to say it back to him the next morning. Very, very timidly...   Looking back I think I only said it because it felt like the right thing to do. I love him as a friend still but I never felt as strongly about him as he did about me.
Lube sucks.

Awww look if she's not used to doing it she might be more comfortable with you finishing on her chest or something till she gets comfortable enough with them/you.    She might've expected you to take it for a while then fuck her to finish... that's been the usual in my experience. Come in the mouth is appealing to some girls and equally unappealing to some. Communicate.
I HAD A DREAM ABOUT EXACTLY THIS. THIS IS SUPER FUCKING WEIRD.
There was a case of a conjoined twin assaulting someone in a barroom brawl. It was decided that he couldn't do any time because that would impinge his twin's freedom. And "it is better to let a guilty man walk free than imprison an innocent one. Here is Stephen Fry on the subject.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNgMncOqlA8#t=1005
Oh I should specify that this approach is for "cold call" type situations where you don't have a lot of time. E.g. The cute girl/guy on the bus. Obviously if you lock eyes in a bar or something have a chat to see if you actually get along.
