Quick Smash Stage Poll, would highly appreciate the input!
No problem, I'll just continue my search then. Thanks!
Silver Mario NIB for Robin, Pit or Ike?
Let's stretch our legs!
Autobots, Rollout!   Present the Puff!

TIFU by listening to my music too loudly   Minding my own business, listening to music and working on my essay in chemistry, my friend pokes me and points out a video. Watching it, I realize he's the interviewee in the video. I reply "Holy shit!"   My music droned out the fact I yelled this. It's bad when the teacher has to hold back laughing.
Sonic.   My fanfics are coming true!
Ice Climbers, Lucas, Wolf and/or Snake.   I think Lucina negates any purpose for Roy to return (minus possible alt. costume for her or Marth if they really want to stretch it), Young Link's basically dead with Toon Link there (unless they revamp him with new weapons and/or the masks), and Pichu didn't work well as a character.  Wolf and Lucas, while they had a lot of similarities to Fox and Ness, still had major differences and lots of unique moves. Snake and Icies were just fun to play as.
Alright, in the case that this is legitimate (which it's looking to be):  What'd his moveset be? Besides the obvious Helicopter hair and wind-up punch ending up somewhere?

Goddammit Ross...
I understand the fact that it's limited edition. That's not my problem with it. My problem's the fact that the pre-orders sold out in 2 hours in a time when the majority of people are working/in school. And when the majority of them aren't even doing it for the figure, that's what bugs me.  As an older brother, it's freaking difficult with my brother and I trying to collect. Marth was sold out Day 1 for me, and I can't find a Captain Falcon anywhere. Luckily, I got my brother his two most wanted, Villager and Little Mac, before they became rare.

Quick question from a younger amiibo hunter   First off, let me just say I'm a sophomore in high school, and not exactly the most persuasive person on the planet.   I've been on the hunt for amiibos for quite a while, namely a few of the more rare ones (Marth, WFT, Falcon, Pit). I was lucky enough to get Villager and Mac a while back, but otherwise I'm out of luck. I've been calling store after store, and I've noticed that some people are a bit... shady. For instance, one of the Wal-Marts told me that they had nothing but Mario and Pikachu. When I asked if there was by any chance a few amiibos in back, he gave a long pause and then said that what they had out was all they had in-store, and that I'd have better luck looking elsewhere, then hung up.   While a majority of employees are cool (One Target employee directed me to a store where he'd seen a few Falcons, but they had sold out by then), it's a bit more difficult to approach the shadier ones and call them out. Considering I'm also unable to drive and have very limited access to ordering online (can't import or go over base price, heck I was only able to pre-order 2 amiibos for the next wave), how should I handle trying to search for the ones I'm missing?
Hell has frozen over.
**1. What amiibo figure would you like to see in the future?:**   I'd definitely like to see some more varied characters to fill up what Smash Bros. doesn't already have, such as Captain Toad, Waluigi, Ridley, Tom Nook, etc. Plus, third-party figures like Rayman and Bayonetta would be cool.   **2. What other types of amiibo functionality do you want?:**   I'd like to see a sandbox-styled game where you can use the characters o build your own games based off their franchises. Think Disney Infinity and LittleBigPlanet combined. Plus, using amiibos as the playable characters, combined with unlocking specific parts/textures/items/vehicles would be cool.   **3. Thoughts/Suggestions for /r/amiibo (if any):**   I'd like to see some sort of way to find the amiibos and where they're in stock, such as if they're out of order or if they're exclusives.
They fist bumped.
A really cool thing happened during the Smash demo at GameStop...   So, just some quick background here:  I'm by no means the best player. I've played with competitive level players, and I'm always coming out in 2nd or worse. So, it's no big surprise I wasn't doing well.   Then there's my brother, who's turning 10 a few days before SSB-Wii U drops. He's by all definitions a casual. He mostly spends time in Brawl spamming Toon Link's dair yelling "DUCKTALES!". So, he tagged along when I went to GameStop, hoping to try out the new game.   There was a group of people that were competitive-level players who were trashing everyone, including me. So, my little brother secretly asks to use my controller so he can play against these guys, and I agreed. They never bothered to look at who was playing.  The two guys both chose Pit, and my brother the Villager. There was a Diddy Kong somewhere, but he died pretty early. Items on, 3 stocks, Palutena's Temple.   Fast forward to near halfway through. Diddy's gone, and everyone has one stock. The Daybreak item begins to appear. One of the Pits manages to grab two, and the final piece spawns behind my brother. This is when I begin to watch him more carefully. He quickly plants a tree near the Daybreak, and one Pit doesn't see it. He rushes towards the piece, and then BAM. My brother finishes him off with a final blow using the tree.   My brother pockets the piece and runs. The final Pit, with the other two pieces, begins to rush towards him. What I saw my brother do, this filthy casual who likes to spam attacks and then Kirbycide 90% of the time, really made me proud of him.   He used Lloid Rocket to space himself decently from the player, and did nothing but constantly avoid the grasp of him by rocketing from one platform to the other, and sometimes using Balloon Fight. He planted trees to create walls in order to get some time. At one point, he landed on the bridge and destroyed it right as Pit landed on it using his Weed Pluck D-Tilt. He continually attacked using the slingshot, and managed to grab nearly every single  arrow this guy threw and shoot it right back. The guy was screaming "Get over here, stop running away! It's my Daybreak!" After managing to rack up enough damage, my brother stops on a platform. He doesn't plant anything, he doesn't do anything, he stands there with enough damage that a good aerial from Pit would kill him.   The Pit rushed towards him. The platform rose above the ground, and the guy cockily laughs as he jumps onto the platform and stands there. My brother begins to dance. Pit started up the Upperdash Arm, and just as the dance ended, my brother rolled for the first time in history, and then used the twirling stick U-Tilt to land a finishing blow on this guy.   The player looked at me, and stuck his hand out as a "good game" kind of thing. I told him it wasn't me playing, and my brother grinned ear to ear and started laughing.  This is the kind of stuff I really enjoy seeing. He's never been this excited about a match before, and suddenly he picks up on some techniques he's never used before, and uses them to win against two competitive players. I've started calling him Decky the Destroyer, and he's enjoying every moment of it.   I really do hope we can see this kind of stuff pop up in the future.
Touche.
Well, Bo Peep happened. Never expected that.
Dat ain't Falco.
All aboard the hype train!
If the only reference is the title, I'll be slightly disappointed. Little Shop was the last musical I performed in, and I loved it.
I volunteer as tribute.
It's good to be the King.
Thank you for this advice!
We're keeping it very low-key for the moment, when the demo comes out I'd definitely appreciate some assistance in patching it for problems. We're trying to make it the same core as Smash Bros. with the best mechanics from different installments, yet add enough new mechanics to differentiate it from any previous or upcoming Smash. It's likely the full version won't be out until after SSB4.
We're definitely trying to get all veterans into the game.
-There aren't any OCs in this game. All veterans are hopefully going to be implemented into the game before the final version.   -This game brings the best of each Smash game together, as well as introduce new things from other fighters and Nintendo games that wouldn't be in the upcoming SSB4.   -Our coders and spriters do. I've worked a small amount, and do know a bit of coding, but I'm able to manage the team efficiently and help assist them if needed.   -I'm trying my best to make this happen so that it's available on Mac, PC and Linux. It may take a while, though.   -Affinity is a work in progress name, it's based off of a new mechanic we're implementing into the game, but I can't reveal it until we can definitely put it into the game.
I'm developing a Smash fangame. Suggestions?   Hi, I'm test_subject6948 and I'm developing a game currently titled "Super Smash Bros. Affinity". It's main goal is to take the best from Smash 64, Melee, Brawl and SSB4, and put it into a free online game that people can pick up and play. Currently, a very basic demo is expected by July, but I need some fan input. Here's what I can tell you so far:  -The game is sprited, similarily to that of Smash Bros. Crusade and Smash Flash 2. We're currently using sprites from other sources in the demo, but custom sprites will be added soon.   -The game's main goal is to focus on improving veterans and mechanics first, but we can promise you that many newcomers will appear eventually.   -The game will attempt to reach the speed of Melee, but appeal to Brawl players as well.   -We're mainly keeping it to Nintendo and some of it's third-party affiliates.   -A variety of Nintendo characters will appear, such as Mario, Link, Samus and Ness, alongside newcomers such as the Balloon Fighter, who's main focus is stage control and lightning-fast aerial combos, as long as you avoid getting your balloons popped.  -Stages include iconic locations from previous games, such as PictoChat, Mario Galaxy and Onett, as well as new stages like Mt. Dedede and Kokiri Forest.   I'd truly appreciate the input on ideas or suggestions, and a link to some in-development pictures is below. Thank you for your assistance.  http://smashboards.com/threads/super-smash-bros-affinity.342020/page-9#post-16846227
