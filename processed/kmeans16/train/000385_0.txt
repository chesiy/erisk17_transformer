I remember reading a very in depth and interesting article on the issues that have arose with the wheels of one of the rovers(not 100% sure which it was). Basically the back left wheel has accrued over the years pretty sizeable hole so NASA actually begun to only drive the rover backwards to limit the risk of allowing the hole to continue to get bigger and eventually to cripple the poor rover. I always assumed this meant some NASA scientist had to manually drive the rover backwards but I guess it does make more sense to just change the programming. Although I'm not sure this is the case because the sensors are obviously designed for sensing forward not backward. Do you happen to know if in this special case the rover is still moved autonomously?
This is exactly what I thought as well and I've got a degree in biomedical engineering and am fairly scientifically literate. The irony in that comment is almost palpable.
Dude I can't believe they did that. Tripping at the Oscars while wearing a dress would be a little too much for me and I'm pretty well acquainted with acid. [You can see Trey almost lose it for a second in the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsvQuJmASSk#t=103), I can only imagine the feeling. Before I knew the story, I didn't think it was possible to respect them more than I did but I was wrong. They're at the very top of my list of living people to trip with for sure.
Been listening to all of these and loving pretty much all of them. Since apparently we have the same taste in music I'm gonna be so bold as to recommend some bands/songs to you its only fair. I'm sure you've hear some of these.   John Butler Trio- Better Than, Used to get High, Ocean ( absolutely amazing solo instrumental on a 12 string. Actually watch [this live performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYJf_ybyVo), to fully appreciate just how fucking good he is)  Dispatch- The General   Sea Wolf- Middle Distance Runner   Iron   Wine - Boy with a coin   Matt Costa- Mr. Pitiful   Jose Gonzalez- Heartbeats   Two Door Cinema Club- SOmething good can work   Dr Dog- Heart it races James Yulli- No surpise  Actually you know what feel free to check out [my grooveshark playlist](http://grooveshark.com/playlist/1111/103994753). It has all of these songs and more, pretty much all my favorite songs right now.

You might say I'm a ramblin' wreck from Georgia Tech and a hell of an engineer.
Actually the studies on Ebola were minimal until this current outbreak. Not many labs have the abilities to test on BSL4 level pathogens and there was little reason to do this as there was a belief that ebola would burn itself out before killing more than 20-100 people because that had happened multiple times already.   I directly work with someone who is at the CDC 4 days a week working on Ebola. I know what they know and I know how smart they are. They are still people though they are not on a whole other planet they are on earth, literally and figuratively. I am up to date on the vast majority of published scientific studies on the matter and believe me there is a lto of debate in the scientific community over certain specifics. I'm sure the CDC has some material which is not publically published in scientific journals but they aren't that far ahead. it is in their interests to keep the rest of the community up to date. Like I said, I said the more you learn the more you learn what you don't know.
That's definitely true. I that the expectation of the public that a serious epidemic would be like the movies instead of something gradual over years along with the notion the government is this omnipowerful agency and not something human and fallible can't help either. Before all of this that's sure what I thought. If you had shown me a movie depicting these exact circumstances a year ago it would have made me roll my eyes. I would have thought how the patient was handled in Dallas was a completely ridiculous scenario and government ineptitude like that would never happen in real life.
You walk into an elevator with a couple people already there. To set the mood you begin with the whole awkward and cliche "I'm sure you're all wondering why I've gathered you here today" thing to them. Awkward silence and maybe a pity laugh ensues. This is just the beginning though.  While "You are my Sunshine" plays over your phone speakers, the seductive and sensual and ever so slow unbuttoning of that trendy and definitely not serial killer-esque trench coat begins. The most important thing to remember here is it you must maintain eye contact with each person for at least 4 seconds and move in sync with the music. If they look away assert your dominance by moving towards them so they have no choice but to be intimidated by your alphaness.   Obviously you are not naked underneath your trench coat, that's what they expect that's tired and boring. Instead you are wearing a suit made up of fresh fish you caught from the river this morning. After catching each fish, you made a quick mental note of it's personality traits. The reason for this will soon be apparent but it is very important to be in tune with your fish friends. This should be obvious but I'll say it anyways, the fish are secured to that green morphsuit you are wearing underneath the trenchcoat and not directly to your skin. This is of course done with with Velcro for easy fish removal. Based on your fish personality assessment you choose the correct fish to give to each person based on looks and personality. The fish personality must be compatible with the personality of the recipient, this is vital. If they won't take this fish, don't be insulted you prepared for this. You pull out our duct tape and ensure that this person and their kindred fish spirit are bound securely. They will thank you later. Once the person-fish kindred spirits have all been united, you pull out that celebration hotdog you've been keeping for just this occasion. You look at each fish-person with a sense of satisfaction, knowing your duty has been done. In a single bite, you down the hotdog and as the energy in the room reaches it's apex, you hear the ding for your floor. In a single swift turn you leave the elevator and the stunned silence of your ever so cooperative audience is all the thanks you'll ever need. Another day, a couple more fish-human hybrid creatures are now on the prowl. The plan is succeeding.
Here ya go all the fun of a circle jerk in a single post!  Stupid sexy flanders. Nothing at all ^(Nothing at all) ^^Nothing ^^at ^^all ^^^Nothing ^^^at ^^^all  The goggles they do nothing.  "The aurora borealus?! At this time of the year?! In this part of the country?! Localized entirely within your kitchen?!" "...Yes" "Can I see it? No"  Well, if it isn't my old friend, Mr. McGreg, with a leg for an arm, and an arm for a leg  Everything's coming up Milhouse!   My cat's breath smells like cat food  Uh, no you've got the wrong number. This is 9-1... 2  Hey, look at my feet. You like those moccasins? Look in your closet; there's a pair for you. Don't like them? Then neither do I! [throws them out the door] Get the hell outta here! Ever see a guy say good-bye to a shoe?   Talking out of turn...that's a paddling. Looking out the window...that's a paddling. Staring at my sandals...that's a paddling. Paddling the school canoe...ooh, you better believe that's a paddling  Me fail English? That's unpossible.   Well, he's kind of had it in for me ever since I accidently ran over his dog. Actually, replace "accidently" with "repeatedly," and replace "dog" with "son."  Inflammable means flammable? What a country!   This is a thousand monkeys working at a thousand typewriters. Soon they'll have written the greatest novel known to man. Let's see. It was the best of times, it was the "blurst" of times! You stupid monkey!  Well, crying isn't gonna bring him back, unless your tears smell like dog food. So you can either sit there crying and eating can after can of dog food until your tears smell enough like dog food to make your dog come back, or you can go out there and find your dog.
Yep my highschool in Texas had enough people for 3 separate teams, JV, D2 varsity and varsity. Really fun sport I miss it a lot, especially playing attack and not have to run constantly all game.   I don't really miss getting beaten on with 6' titanium sticks all the time though. I never wore elbow pads either and took the actual shoulder pads off my shoulder pads so they was just chest pads too. Probably wasn't the smartest thing to do.
I feel like the meme format detracts from the seriousness of the situation a bit though. Maybe its just how I view memes but this post would have hit front page regardless of how it was posted and a news story would have given more context. I came into the comments to figure out who this group of people is and some more insight into what exactly this petition is for. I haven't really found anything except shitty jokes and this loser I went to high school with but I guess that's reddit for you.   Fuck you ryan
That's when you say oh here let me wipe that off for you and pull out your rock hard dick and ever so tenderly get every drop on the tip of your dick.   The moment is finally here! That skill you've been practicing for months, that you've put your life and soul in, it's moment has arrived. You lie down and prepare. Pushing your dick down as far as it will go you steady yourself. Using the cock pushup acquired dick strength, you let her rip. The the cum is shot in a perfect arc right into your own open mouth. A flawless dick catapult. The man juice in your mouth tastes better than ever before, you literally have an orgasm in your mouth.
Amazing. If cait would have just kept running instead of trying to dodge it, it would have probably missed but that instinctive dodge when you see the ult appear is really hard to control
For me a bad trip on acid(never had a bad one on shrooms) is kind of like taking the anxiety and uncomfortable feeling I get when I'm too high or in the wrong environment and multiplying it by 10. I've tripped probably at least 40 times, the last time over a year ago. That was such a bad trip I had to leave my friends because I was paranoid and was at the point where my mind was racing too fast to even be able to form coherent sentences. By the time I wanted to say something, my mind was already somewhere else so anything I said would have be incoherent babble.  I've also convinced myself I was crazy a couple times and that this time I had taken it too far, taken too much acid and I was never gonna come back down. Those trips sucked a lot but a good trip on acid is equally as mind blowing, in an opposite, amazing way.  TLDR: Acid is a hell of a drug
Yeah, he has a ton of really mind blowing videos. My favorite is where he somehow subconsciously convinces like 30 mall goers to raise their hands in the air at the same time with just a few announcements over the loudspeaker.  Honestly, I can't help but be skeptical that he didn't stage some of his videos but everything I've watched paints him as a honest down to earth guy who wouldn't stage things just to increase his ratings.  Here's the video if anyone's interested: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOEKdaXIEHc
