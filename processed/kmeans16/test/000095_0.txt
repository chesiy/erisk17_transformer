I've only read the abstract so not 100% sure on the methodology but there's nothing groundbreaking or novel from their results and conclusions here:  1. Healthy men were given a high fat diet with the same number of calories as a "normal" diet.  2. Study 1 showed that after 5 days of being on the high fat diet no changes in insulin sensitivity or metabolism (not sure exactly what they measured) occurred. If you just took this at face value (ignoring the short treatment time etc.) you might think that a high fat diet has no effects on those markers.  3. Study 2 shows that changes are occurring at the molecular level (study 1 is more of a whole tissue measure). In general they are saying that markers of inflammation (endotoxin) increase (which is thought to contribute to diabetes onset and progression). P38 is a kinase (a protein that can phosphorylate and change the behaviour of other proteins) and is involved in many process including insulin resistance, glucose uptake and can be activated in response to inflammation. The phosphorylation (a marker of its activity) of p38 is altered with the high fat diet and may contribute to the metabolic and transcript (gene expression changes) changes.  4. Overall the study is saying that molecular events that lead to impaired insulin sensitivity and/or insulin resistance are started with 5 days of the high fat diet but it's not enough time for it to manifest into actual insulin resistance.
Good point, human cardiac progenitor cells (from human ES/IPSC lines) have been shown to be functional within 2 weeks in 3D culture (in fibrin or collagen gels) so their protocol to get cardiac progenitors might not be optimized to generate functional tissue. They just said that the cardiac progenitors were a gift from a company in the paper so it's hard to know how good/differentiated the cells were when seeded.   Thanks for the reply!
The effect of more vigorous exercise on life expectancy is hotly debated and still being figured out. Several studies have shown that those who do a lot of endurance (20miles/wk) **appear** to lose the benefits of exercise on prolonged exercise - it doesn't shorten life expectancy but doesn't increase it. This is one of those studies and is free access and easy to read.    http://indorgs.virginia.edu/MuscleClub/OKeefe_JH_article1%2B2.pdf    Some of the studies are limited as the runners aren't split into groups with confounding variables (e.g. family history of CVD, other illnesses etc.). When accounting for those variables one study found the same effect, very intense exercise prevented increases in life expectancy.   http://content.onlinejacc.org/article.aspx?articleid=1855458    The studies don't mean that you shouldn't exercise at high intensity and if you enjoy what you do then keep doing it. It might be that quality of life is higher but life expectancy isn't increased for people who chronically train at high intensity. More studies are needed to be done to understand if there is a true relationship between very intense exercise and life expectancy.
Something I put on another post about this:  The term muscle in these studies is a little misleading and a bit confusing. The "muscles" they make are not meant to be used in people but in machines as actuators.  They took the outer layer of an onion (the epidermis) as at the microscopic level it mimicked a very basic muscle structure (aligned, densely packed rectangles in the onion vs aligned, densely packed cylinders in native muscle).   They then freeze-dried it to get rid of water and to make it structurally stable. This meant that they had a sheet that kind of looked like a muscle but obviously without any contractile proteins to make the structure contract.  To get the muscle to contract the added/plated a very thin layer of gold to both sides of their onion layer. Gold is electrostatic, so when the applied a voltage they could get their onion layer to move due to electrostatic forces. Essentially the same basic science as when you rub a balloon against a surface (the voltage in this study) and it makes your hair (in this case the artificial "muscle") stick up.  I don't know enough about these artificial "muscles" to know the significance of the work but it's a pretty cool proof of concept. If this will translate to something you can buy or will wind up in electronics I'd assume not as down the line somebody will engineer a polymer or plastic that does this.
The .gov really has no influence on the paper, the website is a database where peer-reviewed journals upload abstracts and links to accepted papers. Journals from all over the world (i.e. with no government affiliations) use the database as it enables researchers to easily find new or old papers.  The paper is a review paper, summarizing the findings in the field so no new findings or physical study was performed. The paper is also peer-reviewed by experts in the field who would/should ensure that a fair reflection of the literature was provided and discussed.
Scientists engineer the most complete in vitro slow muscle to date by using only electrical stimulation
1. Scrutinizing studies and taking them at face value is a good thing. The linked media article title "Study Finds Evidence That the MIND Diet May Protect Patients From Developing Alzheimers Disease" and the journal article title "MIND diet associated with reduced incidence of Alzheimer's disease". At no point do they say MIND diet score more predictive - where are you getting that from? You say that "articles appear with title discrepancies..." I guess you mean articles in magazines and newspapers. Unfortunately, sensationalization occurs in the media and in some peer-reviewed journals but I don't see much here, the articles say that it MAY help which is all that can be taken from the studies at the moment.  2. Recent reports of wide-scale falsification in reports - that has happened recently (it has happened before and will again, the system is not flawless and scientists are humans that will be tempted by greed and money. The system is somewhat self-correcting, if nobody can repeat your cure or whatever then your study will be the exception and not the rule) with 43 papers to date that may increase. The 43 papers appeared to be from a Chinese ring and there's no suggestion that this paper would be part of that (US based and different publisher (i.e. NOT Biomed Central) to the ones linked to the falsification reports).  3. Echo chamber/positive feedback loop - I see what you mean but this paper builds on previous finding from 2 different labs (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20305128 and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23670794?dopt=Abstract) and no shared authors between the 3 papers. Repeatable findings (associations/correlations in this case) are part of a step forward and collectively strengthen the associations and increase evidence that it is an avenue to pursue.  4. You trust findings from a wider audience and peer reviewed journals rarely are. (Linking the source would be a major help as I don't quite get the point - I can only assume that you mean that the reviewers are too narrow focused on a certain area. I'd say having an expert in the field to review a paper a good thing, I wouldn't get an electrician and librarian to evaluate my heart health, I'd go to a cardiologist or a group of them who may be less "wide" but would have more relevant knowledge) So what other findings/sources do you use then? Does that mean you have sources you prefer to peer-reviewed articles? Personally, I'd base any health choices from peer-reviewed articles or use such articles to see if any claims have any truth to them. The peer-review system isn't perfect but I don't know of a better system (it can be improved with the publication of more studies showing no effects amongst other things).   5. I interpret this paper as saying that this diet may help decrease or delay the onset of Alzheimers. More detailed questionnaires (geographical location, occupation, socio-economic status, exercise levels etc.) would be needed to eliminate potential confounding factors (e.g. those on the MIND diet may exercise more and once you account for that the diet doesn't have a significant effect). The mechanisitic basis would need to be determined as well (i.e. what part of the diet is beneficial, on the molecular level how does it work etc.). All that takes time, in the meantime I think the **authors** have done a decent job without hyperbole (*media coverage* may be different and they thrive on hyperbole which is unethical and disheartening). The Mediterranean diet has been shown to be **correlated** with increased healthspan (better cardiovascular function I know of perhaps more) so based on current information it seems like it's a good diet to prolong healthspan. Does it mean that it definitely will?, no - it might do nothing. I think the current information should be released to the public to let them decide if they want to follow it or guide their diet choices.  EDIT - balanced out point 2 a bit more.
Haploinsufficiency of myostatin protects against aging-related declines in muscle function and enhances the longevity of mice
The paper is open access but here's the abstract:  The molecular mechanisms behind aging-related declines in muscle function are not well understood, but the growth factor myostatin (MSTN) appears to play an important role in this process. Additionally, epidemiological studies have identified a positive correlation between skeletal muscle mass and longevity. Given the role of myostatin in regulating muscle size, and the correlation between muscle mass and longevity, we tested the hypotheses that the deficiency of myostatin would protect oldest-old mice (2830 months old) from an aging-related loss in muscle size and contractility, and would extend the maximum lifespan of mice. We found that MSTN+/ and MSTN/ mice were protected from aging-related declines in muscle mass and contractility. While no differences were detected between MSTN+/+ and MSTN/ mice, MSTN+/ mice had an approximately 15% increase in maximal lifespan. These results suggest that targeting myostatin may protect against aging-related changes in skeletal muscle and contribute to enhanced longevity.
Children with Type 1 would benefit from this and is what Viacyte VC-01 treatment is targeted at and where they have started clinical trials:  http://viacyte.com/clinical/clinical-trials/  Type 1 diabetics don't produce insulin due to autoimmune-induced loss and dysfunction of beta cells. Type II diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance - i.e. insulin is produced but glucose uptake from the blood is diminished/not as effective. Most research has focused on increasing/restoring insulin sensitivity with drugs and exercise and this enables the condition to be managed in many cases and disease progression to be slowed. However, over time and in more severe cases the beta cells start to not function as well (i.e. release less insulin) and start to die (decreasing insulin levels more). A couple of recent studies have shown that injecting high levels of insulin in type II diabetics can help manage the disease and improve the symptoms, like this one in patients:  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18502299  In this study they showed that injecting beta cells alone helped improve insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerances in animals fed a high fat diet which is used to induce insulin resistance. However, the tissues which uptake glucose would still be less insulin sensitive than healthy tissues so they tested the effect of combined cell therapy and traditional drug therapy. When they added drugs that improve insulin sensitivity in those tissues (i.e. normal drug treatments for type 2 patients) they found that the cell transplant and drug treatment worked synergistically and improved outcomes more than either treatment alone.
The difference between the EU and U.S. Cattle feed, antibiotic and hormone use has been shown to effect serum (basically blood without cells) and can impact biology research.   For example, In this paper tissue engineered muscles exposed to EU cow serum became fast muscle and US serum resulted in a slow muscle, though the specific factors causing the change were not identified.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25146978
Rapid blood test may help decrease antibiotic misuse
New therapeutic target for myotonic dystrophy
FDA approved drug Epitholone B promotes significant spinal cord regeneration in mice.
In the animal studies they used an oral garage which is basically a tube that delivers the drug directly to the stomach. Dasatanib was at a concentration of 5mg/kg and quercertin at 50mg/kg body weight, most likely they were dissolved in water but it might have been with a different solvent. That info is from page 8 of the paper.  There's no need to bind it RNA which I can't see making any difference unless it prevents it from degradation, if you let me know where it says that then I'll have a look as I skimmed through the paper to find the dosing info.
Hypoxia may actually drive tumours to be more aggressive and promote metastasis. The lack of oxygen converts their metabolism to be glycoyltic (which allows them to better survive without vascularization), upregulates anti-apoptotic genes/proteins, promotes release of factors (i.e. VEGF and PDGF etc.) that promote blood vessel growth into the tumour and may help keep the cells in an undifferentiated state, which in turns helps to keep them proliferating.   There's a review here that shows providing oxygen doesn't seem to stimulate tumour growth and talks about the role of hypoxia in tumour progression and phenotype  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3510426/
