Definitely check out Hotline Miami. It's a two part game series, both on PSN. I can't even begin to explain how phenomenal this game is. Both gameplay and story. Music too. Here, check out a trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5AJtaYx1Eg
Philadelphia Warhammer enthusiasts?
Dude I don't even know, it was two tabs of the strongest doses I've ever taken. None of my dealers have known about the doses so it's always been hard to say. I remember just looking around me and since I couldn't see anything it actually helped me to just focus on what I was thinking and I was kinda just like "I can't see anything... Well fuck." Haha
Okay so I ended up getting the Logitech G600: http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/product/g600-mmo-gaming-mouse  it's a good mouse, has a ton of buttons (A third button to the right of the right mouse clicker AND side buttons on the scroll wheel) plus custom LED's, the works. Not sure if I can handle it all though! I just tried last night and remapped all my hotkeys and it's a little overwhelming. Maybe I just have to get used to it?
Oh I'm currently using all of the hotkeys on my mouse, hence why I mentioned them aha I just need more
Please update with the models present on the board! I'd love to see more of your work :D
This is ridiculously bad ass. Nice fucking work!
Just wanted to make sure this was a genuine strain, no BS. Thank you for the response though!
But it's not hard to realize that it has a slash through "$80". I think it's common sense that most people know new games are worth $59.99 so if they "accidentally" click on it then I mean really, how can you be that careless? Not you in specific but anyone who would get angry at such a thing. I don't think they were trying to trick anyone and be nefarious about the whole thing.
I want to get Grim Dawn and Stanley Parable but I only have about $30 left.  Should I wait to see what tomorrow holds or no?
[ID Request] Found near tree root in Eastern PA, light rain. Looked at list of local mushrooms but doesn't fit any description to me.
Want to try the "Helium Hood" method

Me too, it's almost unthinkable that PC's are becoming a more popular platform than consoles at this point. I have a huge wishlist of games on Steam though. Some of the ones I'm looking for deals on would be D4, Project Cars, Mortal Kombat X, and Killing Floor 2. What about you?
Yarp
Good old role playing
Dammit, we need lamps
Does the rice really work that well?
Okay, just performed this test and the fan doth spin.
Absolutely agree.
I would purchase your room.
Volume differences are... difficult to comprehend?   At times, usually during my peak, I'll notice that increases and decreases in volume are kind of weird. It's like, I notice the volume going up and down but I can't tell what's too loud or too quiet. Does that make sense? Anyone else get this?
I just realized that's The Son running toward Tony.
My good friend said he'd call me at 10pm to see if I wanted to get picked up. I still have so much planned for my trip at home though. What should I do? Uncertainty is always exciting, and I think we might going to his really trippy room buuuuuut I did wanna experience a few things first. Like, things I've been saving in my journal for next time I trip. I'm peaking now, so that's the thing. Do I spend my peak with them or with me? Why am I asking reddit this? You guys can't make decisions for me Ahahah But it'd be cool if you could. I'm sorry for the typing too, I feel like it's getting sloppy. It's gross, I hate it man. But whao didn't mean to get negative. 3 3 But yeah, this was an unnecessarily long reply to your comment haha
Love tripping out on this amazing album artwork.
It's shitty. I went to take a walk for like two hours just because it was killing me and now I'm back in my room. I just can't fall asleep, I just want to fast forward to when we can try again. I'm so upset with myself.
Fuck your artificial barriers and fuck your shipment of goods as well.
Get off your high horse, I didn't come to LSD for bad vibes...
Interstellar viewing experience, tripping balls   So when Interstellar was still playing in theaters I decided to go see it with my sister and that we would both take two hits of some Grateful Dead. So I wanted to time it perfectly so we'd be tripping by the time the movie started. I gave us a 45 min window and I toked a bit on the car ride to help the peak.  We go in the theater and, surprise, there's these two empty seats right in the Goldie Locks zone of the theater! These seats... where fucking leather armchairs that reclined and all! I saw these seats and I was pissing myself with excitement. We get chilled and then the trailers start. It's hard remembering any of them but they were pretty intense for the most part. Then, the feature presentation begins. Fucking Interstellar.  This fucking movie was just the perfect setting for a trip. Great story, great acting, emotional, great cinematography, and it's about fucking space! The scene where it's just static shots of Saturn and the calm thunderstorm sounds are playing (When the one character puts on the Sounds of Nature CD to calm down) was just perfect. Absolutely beautiful.  Here's something I really loved about it; When a certain topic came up in conversation in the movie (Love, time travel, God, etc.) it was like a roundtable discussion. They didn't let anything fly over your head, they almost explained it directly to the audience with pictures and metaphors and everything. Great learning experience. When they were arguing about love it was just like, DAMN. Also, the first time they go through the black hole and look at the videos from back home over the last however many years... I almost cried with them aha Powerful stuff.  Then, the climax of the movie hits. Everything has been getting more intense and darker by this point. It's one of those mindfuck movies and I HEAVILY enjoy those. When I'm tripping you can imagine how cool that is. So then the story really begins to wrap itself up in a pretty intense way. Arguing, events happening on Earth and in space, it was a lot all at once. My sister started freaking out. She walked out of the theater and of course I walked out with her. Missed the ending of the movie and I will regret it to this day because she decided to just have a cigarette and call our ride...  I don't know the science of it but... Did she really freak out over having a nicotine craving?? Just a thought, I'm not a smoker but it seems logical I guess. Still a great experience that I wouldn't trade for the world and I encourage everyone to trip the fuck out and watch this on surround sound!
Yeah that's another reason why I'm really liking this subreddit. Lots of like minded people here, I've seen plenty of titles that look like they've just been extracted from my mind written by trippers. In regard to babysitting them, yeah, old real quick. It's a waste of a trip sometimes and I value that time since I never know when I can experience it again. Solo tripping is fantastic but at the same time I want to tell people my thoughts haha It's a cruel irony, it's the one time I like telling people what I think.

DUDE, I was heading into the theater with my ex when this came out. I had four tabs in my pocket... This chick... said "No, not in public."  As soon as the opening credits rolled, I was like "Yup, I should be tripping."  That's what you get for being whipped I guess...
