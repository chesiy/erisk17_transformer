That's the plan at the moment - I'm just finding it difficult because my options for getting away from the situation are minimal. I've moved interstate to a city where I have no friends or family. Short of eating out   sitting in coffee shops all day   night I have no other options, I can't go anywhere else except home. And most of these issues arise when I'm trying to sleep.
I get what you're saying but its now been two days since it happened and I haven't heard from her. I would have given the benefit of the doubt if she had reached out and apologized for her behavior, given that she was under the influence and no actual harm came of it, but she clearly does not have an issue with her behavior and that says enough for me.
Your best bet is to uninstall any tweaks you've installed in the last 24 hours since you started having issues (you can do this in safe mode). Respringing in safe mode just goes back to safe mode again, which is why your tweaks aren't showing up. You have to reboot, and if you're sill getting a black screen then there is still a problem tweak. Possibly try installing ilex rat while in safe mode and use that to remove all your tweaks.

Yeah it really wouldn't have been much more trouble to add the vendor prefixes, there are websites you can just copy and paste the code into and it will automatically generate the extra code where relevant.
haha love your take on this, thank you!

No.
Nothing that happens to you before 30 matters, in the grand scheme of things; it just doesn't. The sooner teens and 20 somethings accept that, the better off they will be, and the less suicides and depression will occur.  While I agree with you somewhat, let me also tell you why I disagree with you invalidating the way people feel as well. Life is proportional... as you get older, things that may have previously seemed huge to you are not quite as big. This is simply because you have experienced more. Take this [crudely made pie chart](http://i.imgur.com/U59ok5I.png). Say you've been in a relationship for 3 years. For an 18 year old, it is *proportionally* larger than what it would be for a 30 year old. That relationship ending, if we were to scale it, would feel the same way it would for a 30 year old to lose a relationship of ~5 years. It's a bit poorly explained, but hopefully you do get where I'm going with that.  The point is, just because things are insignificant to you does not mean that the validity and strength of the feelings that a person experiences is not real. I say this because at 18 years old, I have been through a bit of shit. And maybe it's trivial. Looking back now, I can see that what was going on was stupid and dumb, but hindsight is always like that. If I could go back to my past self and try to explain it, I wouldn't listen. The vastness of my feelings wouldn't go away because I told myself that it was insignificant (I even did so at the time).  So; I do agree with you. But you should never, ever invalidate someone's feelings. Because that will cause more suicides than people "taking what they go through far, far too seriously".
The Play Store version won't be 2.0. Reinstall the .apk you have. Google rolls out big updates like this slowly based on your device's IMEI and country, so not everyone gets 2.0 at the same time (even though the app's description says so).  Edit: to understand, go to hangouts in the play store, expand the description and look at the current version. Mine is still 1.2 ( http://www.imgur.com/6kLfCTf.png )
And how exactly would you know what other phones I have had? I had a galaxy s2 before my n4 and it had hardware keys, and I much prefer onscreen ones. Especially since my home button needed a push so hard I was blistering my thumb from extended use.
While I agree with many of the points you made, I think that a lot of people in this thread are jumping to conclusions. I think its a safe assumption to make that Google were rushed with the nexus 5 release, and have only had the resources to get KitKat optimized for the nexus 5. I'm not going to promise to eat my dick but I'd bet good money that the factory images that drop for the nexus 4 will start with 4.4.1.
Are you talking about an OTA update or for when the ROM scene reaches 4.4?  If the former, you have to do the following steps:  * Flash stock recovery * Flash latest stock ROM (if you are not already on it)  An OTA update will remove root and overwrite your radio (assuming there is a new one) so you will lose root and LTE.  If the latter:  * Nothing - When you flash a 4.4 based ROM you will have to wipe data though, so you may want to ensure you have some sort of backup.
they don't just push out builds if they are not 100% satisfied they are production ready for end users.  Uhh, that is objectively incorrect. The last "M" build put a few of the Galaxy line in a bootloop.
Just to be clear, the comment above yours is talking strictly about FB Messages only. You can set Messenger to handle SMS as well, but it does not support group SMS (try adding more than one **phone number** to a message, it gives you an error). It also doesn't support the sending of MMS, so you have to switch back to Go SMS or stock MMS to send pictures.
Thanks for the comments, I'll definitely fix up the horizon on that photo. I had trouble with the exposure because this is the first time I've taken photos in such harsh light, I really should have shot in RAW but I didn't, they're JPGs so I couldn't get much more of the sky out of them (well, I could get some back on a few of them, like you said). They are mostly unedited except for the first few, so I'll go back over them and try to fix up the things you suggested. Thanks!

Its not really about the physical issues that arise, its a matter of principle. Nothing quite says "I think you're white trash and you don't have the right to touch me." than people deliberately avoiding your hand to place the money on the counter. You have obviously never worked in sales/hospitality because you would understand it if you had.
* Do a nandroid and a titanium backup. * Download desired cm10 ROM and equivalent gapps (remember, cm10 uses a different gapps package than cm10.1) from get.cm or goo.im or wherever else and place on SD card/internal storage * Wipe caches, flash cm10, flash gapps, flash anything else you desire (kernel, init.d scripts etc), wipe caches again to be sure and fix permissions  You should boot up and it should bring up the "optimising apps" screen. If you start getting force closes or get stuck in a bootloop then perform a data wipe and restore only user applications and data from titanium.
Its prettier. Not much else.
S2 has only been supported by AOKP since JB build 3, afaik. I don't think many people realize it has official support, since there are a lot of unofficial ports on the XDA forums and they all have quite a bit of following.
The past few months have helped me *really* get to know myself, and I've discovered that a huge character flaw of mine is that I just love helping people... almost to the point where I cannot feel happiness on my own, but I have to be making someone else happy to even feel okay.   I've always been the guy that people talk to and I love giving out advice and taking care of my friends. I care way too much about people that don't care about me and its resulted in me getting burned time after time. I try to not let it change me into someone uncaring, because I'm only 17 and I know that I'm the nice guy at heart. I'm a little less trusting now though.   So thanks, your words hit home and mean a lot to me. :)
Its not new. Flash a stock ROM with Odin.
No worries. Seriously dude... you are just wrecking shit up tonight/today. You've bounced back awesomely after the Play Store fiasco and are obviously working very hard to make yours the best Reddit app there is. Its definitely the best looking at the moment, and if it keeps improving the way it has been there will honestly be no competition whatsoever... congrats.
Just off the top of my head:  * Sidebar viewing * Intents (handling reddit.com links like you said) * Sharing a link to posts that aren't self posts * RES-style advanced comment/post formatter/edior
[CM10 nightlies are coming along nicely.](http://get.cm/?device=i9100) It won't reach "stable' status for a while, because they're having trouble with hwcomposer (which means that Project Butter isn't completely there for the SGS2 at the moment.) **Note**; this is for the **International Galaxy S II** (i9100), if you have a carrier variant than you'll have to go to its relevant XDA forum.
According to its XDA-developers thread, if the app TriangleAway is installed and used on the ALE8 firmware, it will reset the flash counter and remove "System is modified" from Download Mode. [The thread can be found here](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1494114).
Probably something to do with the fact that the notification shade is always there, while the home screen requires a button press.
[Senior MATH B/Calculus] Rates of change - really stuck. (x-post r/cheatatmathhomework)   Okay firstly I'm just going to type out the question word for word:  Alex, an accomplished runner, has just been dropped off at Bandicoot Camp in the bush. The roads back to her home on Dugong Lane run south for 6km to the top of Cassowary Hill and then east 8km to the turn off for Dugong Lane. After limbering up for a run home through the bush, she gets a call on her mobile that she needs to get home quickly and there is no transport available at the camp.  Alex decides to run through the bush directly to the road heading east from Cassowary Hill to Dugong lane on a bearing of 135^o T.  If she runs at V km/h on the road to Dugong lane and b% of V through the bush, evaluate whether this is the best heading to run on?  Investigate Alex's options if she runs along the southerly road to Cassowary Hill between 10% to 20% faster than she can run through bush.  You will be assigned a value of V and b from the tables below. Circle your assigned values.  My assigned values are: **V km/h = 20** and **b = 50, b = 61**  I've gotten as far as drawing up a [diagram](http://i.imgur.com/JqJLg.png) to represent the paths, with the diagonal line being the direction Alex is travelling in (through the bush). I'm having a total mind blank and can't get any further than that. :/ Any help would be appreciated.
Totally new to LoL and this type of game, is there a video I can watch or a glossary I can read?   I know there's plenty of guides in the sidebar but the thing that I find myself having most trouble with is simply the vocabulary and lingo that is used in this game - I'm trying to read guides and posts on reddit and I end up coming away more confused than I already was! If someone could point me in the right direction, that would be great, because I've totally enjoyed the few games that I've played.
