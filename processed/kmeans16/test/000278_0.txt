Dude nice, I have the Echo 1 rebrand of that gun. Only difference is that my orange tip was easy as hell to take off, the plastic was like chalk lol
ayyy
He's half-ghillie man. [Classic.] (http://i.imgur.com/zUrC8m7.png)
Ah
I saw all of the original movies and I get the whole Engrish joke. I just don't remember someone talking like that I guess.
Okay lol. You said it was the E above and someone else said it was the E but then someone said it was the standard.  Alright, now I know what it is lol
I really like it, I was just pointing out that it isn't specific to anything.   Just random gear is all.
Fuck I knew that, I'm out of it and in school lol. I do have to disagree on the naming thing though. Not really codsoftery at all
Alrighterino, old Dildie is sharing a dark tale of his past to feel better about himself (x-post confesssion)   This is something that happened to me awhile ago when I was 11. I figured writing it somewhere would help me feel better-ish. I'm just going to type it how it's written in my little manifesto of mine.  Back in 2009, or 2008? I can't remember the year but it was awhile ago. I'm 17 and it happened when I was 11 for reference. When I was younger I took a grand trip to Canada, Alaska, and Seattle with my grandparents and my cousin. The cruise started from port in West Seattle (like by the Space Needle-ish and the cool stuff.)   When we arrived in Seattle we decided to stay at a hotel for three days to visit the Dry Soda Company (I saw it on Food Network and was curious) the Space Needle, and, regretfully, the famous Pikes Place Market. Well, not regretfully as in going there was bad, but the market is a dark place in my mind because of my experience.   We explored the lights and sounds, and shopped the first day. That was amazing. Seattle was, and is, a beautiful city with beautiful sights. Well, the "supreme travel itinerary" as my grandma dubbed it, was that we'd go to the Pikes Place market on the second day. Now, I don't know how it looks now, but when I visited there were a lot of homeless people. My grandparents told me not to pay any mind to them and to ignore them. This made me sad. A blemish of sorts, but it didn't deter me from the whole face of Seattle.  I remember that whole morning as vivid as yesterday. I woke up, ignored the not-so-inviting continental breakfast and waited for my grandparents to finish. Hell, I even remember playing Yoshi's Island DS on my DS Lite. Well, they were always cheap.  They finished up and we were off. As soon as we left the entrance we were greeted by a young women. She was obviously homeless by the tattered clothes and McDonalds cup with loose change in it. She smelled like pot and paint thinner. She looked hungry and distraught. Her haggard frame didn't take away from her still young looking face. She seemed to be in her late 20's or early 30's from what I recall.  Anyways, I remember reaching for my pokemon themed wallet with the intent to give her change. As I went to rummage for a penny or two my grandpa scolded me and snatched the wallet from my hands. "No test_subject8195" he said, "There's a reason she's like that."  "There's a reason she's like that."  That stuck with me. It still sticks with me. Here was this human being reduced to the status of a stray dog, and he said that. I remember sighing, still shocked at his demeanor, and trailing behind them. I remember seeing a young gentlemen, probably a concierge or a bag boy, chase her off. "Oh well." I remember thinking.   Fast forward through a sea of cardboard pleas, winos, and street performers and we reached our destination. Pikes Place Market. I remember splitting off from my grandparents and cousin while watching a young gentlemen toss a fish around and do other tricks. After he was finished I clapped, and turned around.   Gone. My grandparents were nowhere to be found and I was caught in a sea of fish smell, patrons, and the sinking feeling that I was inevitably fucked. I scrambled through the crowd to no avail. The thick smog of bodies clouded my view, and my calls for help went unanswered. After breaking through the crowd I found a back alley. Scared, confused, and hoping for a break from the hustle and bustle I walked through the alley.   Torn flyers, waste bins, and other arrangements of junk littered the passage. Then I heard it. The sound that haunts my dreams and my mind when it wanders.  Gurgling. A low mumbling gurgle laced with coughs and the unmistakable sound of struggling. It sounded rather odd, but my adventurous 11 year old brain led me to the source. Oh how I wish it didn't. How I wish I would have just sauntered off or turned around.  I walked over to a tipped over trashcan, and a dumpster. I didn't know what to expect, but it wasn't like the movies. It wasn't slow, but it was silent. Save for the god awful gurgling and struggling. I even remember the picture on what I now assume was a craft beer bottle strewn along with the forgotten waste. There was a rabbit with a shit eating grin on its face giving a thumbs up. Soon after seeing that my eyes led me to the source of the sounds.   It was a kneeling yet slumped, convulsing pile. Then she looked up. It was the homeless woman from earlier. I stumbled back and recoiled in fear. "She must have knocked over the trash can and hurt herself" I thought. The thought seems innocent now, and I wish it would have been the case.  Her tattered black hoodie was caked in what appeared to be vomit and bodily fluids. It was still fresh because I remember the smell overwhelming me. Then I saw it, there was a needle jutting out of her arm. At the time I couldn't comprehend what it was, or why the woman was acting so strange. It's that innocence I wish I could still possess.   But no, this woman was overdosing. She was dying. In front of my eyes, this woman was dying and I couldn't do jack shit to save her. I was a kid, and I was afraid.   She looked up at me and her lips seemed to try to form words, but nothing happened.  Merely shaking and more trembling before she fell and slumped even further on to the grimey alley ground. The look still haunts me, it still causes me to have panic attacks or throw up if I picture it well enough. The best way I can explain it without forcing myself to think too much about it, is milk with a little blue dye in it. That's what her skin looked like.  She feebly reached out at my pant leg. I stepped back more, and then she slumped over. I wasn't sure if she was dead, but I nudged her with my foot. She didn't move. She was dead, she had to be.   I screamed. I screamed louder than I ever will in my life. I ran after that, probably the fastest I'd ever run too. I ran back the way I came, past the stupid fucking rabbit bottle, past the flyers, past the market area where I was before. I only stopped when I reached the gift shop area.  I cried. I cried more than I ever will I think. I never cared for my grandparents, let alone any of my relatives, but I was elated to find them browsing the selection of shirts. They were wondering why I was crying.  I eluded to the fact that I watched a woman die, and rather just told them I was hysterical because I was lost. I still wish that was the case looking back.   I feel, like a part of me died when that woman died. I feel like watching anybody die an untimely and violent death would kill something inside of anybody. Seattle was, and is, a beautiful city with beautiful sights.   I am never going back there though. I'm going to leave whatever part of me died there. That's the way it's meant to be.
Time for Dildie to shitpost about another anime he finished   Put off watching Cowboy Bebop for far too long because so many other shows seemed more appealing. I thought, "Oh old show, so it must be drawn old and gross."   After listening to some of the soundtrack and a friend bugging me to watch it too much, I fired up Deluge and torrented that mother. Two words. Holy shit.  The whole story was amazing, the animation and art style was **leagues** ahead of the time. For 1998 it's a really pretty show. That coupled with the great soundtrack and story bumped it up into my top five.  If you've been putting off watching this show or feel iffy about it, watch it. 9/11 would watch again.
Do you guys ever feel like airsoft you is different than regular you?   This is kind of hard to explain, but when I airsoft I feel like a different person. When I started airsoft obviously [I had really bad gear and bad guns] (http://i.imgur.com/nmtS8ZN.jpg) and I thought, "I'm going to get better and get better gear." Ever since the days of plinking around with friends with our springers and LPEG's between jam sessions I knew airsoft was a different hobby.   When I airsoft I feel stronger, and I feel like buying more gear makes airsoft me stronger. It's weird.
I Just Want More/I Just Want to Go Away   To give a little background, I just turned 17 on the third, don't know if this has anything to do with anything. Some of my Reddit friends may see that I posted this, I don't really care. I want to travel the world and I want more now. I live in a shitty small town of only 1,000 to 1,200 people. At this point in my life my grades are only good enough to get out of highschool. I own a small business doing graphic design and articles, and I wash dishes at a local restaurant and started training to cook, but that won't get me anywhere. I need to take charge but it's so hard. When I graduate I'm either going to be a neet, or working my shitty jobs living in a shitty apartment. Now, I've had plans to take two years of general studies and get some sort of art degree, but I don't think that will get me where I want to be or anything. I just want to help people and see the world, and get away.  Now that that's out of the way. I would follow my uncle's footsteps and join the military, but even then I don't think it'd be worth it. I don't believe in anything that we're fighting for. Would joining the peace corps or whatever work? Should I just pack up and leave when I turn 18 and freelance? I'm at my wits end, but the only thing I really want now is to be away and to help people.
Hey kiddies, uncle DildoHands is back   That is all. Also I know about the other chat sub for the super secret cool kids so you guys should approve me.
Finished PMC Loadout   This is my current set up I'm going to be running for the better part of this summer. I've always loved the look of the average PMC kit so I went in that direction. Please excuse the tactical skinny jeans, I just got off of school and at the time I took these pictures and I was as giddy as a child on Christmas. Don't fret, I use eye-pro, I just left them at a friends house. For the purpose of picture, I thought my casual prescriptions would be fine.   [FUCK WHEN EVER I TRY TO FORMAT PRETTY THE IMAGES ARE TINY SO HAVE AN ALBUM OF THE PICTURES NORMAL] (http://imgur.com/a/ArEwK)   **KIT LIST FROM TOP TO BOTTOM**  **Hat-** Basic tactical cap from Condor  **Patch-** Sassy MilSpec Monkey patch  **Comms-** Just a basic Element headset  **Shemagh-** Basic black and white Condor shemagh  **Jacket-** Just a Condor Softshell Jacket, nothing special  **Patch-** Hazard PVC American Flag Patch  **Chest Rig-** No name brand I added to the cart   **Dump Pouch-** Just a Condor Drop Leg dump pouch  **Knee Pads-** Standard Condor quick release knee pads  **Sling-** GP sling plate, came with a one-point sling  Other than that I'll probably just get some Khaki's or some blue jeans to finish off the kit.   **GUN** It's a bone stock WE Open Bolt M4 I posted a little while back with a previous kit. I run four magazines right now, but plan to get at least six more (I'm very trigger happy.) Otherwise I hope you enjoyed my kit, and I tried to keep everything as detailed and nice as possible.
Pistol Questions.   So I recently bought my first real primary weapon, and being that all of my disposable income goes into airsoft, I now have enough money for a sidearm.   So there's one pistol I was wondering about, and couldn't find many reviews on. The [WE 3.8 Compact] (http://www.evike.com/products/41759/).  Now I've had great luck with WE GBBR's so far, but I've heard of problems with their pistols. For the price, this gun looks pretty and for the price seems nice. Thoughts?
[Question/Discussion] A lot of questions about the WE Open Bolt M4.   So I have a six hundred dollar budget, and I want to jump into the GBBR world. The WE seems like a really good choice out of thr box, and of course I'd get upgrade parts from RAtech and such. I've been on Arnies Airsoft, Airsoft Society, and a plethora of forums to find reviews. I've also watched every review on YouTube. At this point I'm pretty dead-set on this gun.  Now with six hundred dollars will I have enough for the gun and magazines? If so, how many magazines should I buy? I usually play thirty minutes games at our friends private field, with short breaks for reloading and drinks.  Next quick question, anybody with past experience, what parts should be replaced? Delving into a whole new type of airsoft rifles is pretty confusing. All over I've heard, " RAtech, RAtech, RAtech."  HELP /R/AIRSOFT!
