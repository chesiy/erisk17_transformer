And then you look at everyone else like "yeah I did all that shit. I'm a crazy motherfucker"
yumm
Source anyone?
I told my dad that I needed help and I couldn't feel any worse   Bear with me, I swear it's all relevant.  I'm a 20 year old gay man who is currently living at home, with a very non existent social life. I've never been in a serious committed relationship where I called him my boyfriend. It's always been strictly physical and I just always went along with it, anything to hopefully have a relationship. I know how that sounds and it took me a whole to realize how ridiculous it is. A guy I was seeing last year (let's call him Bill) ended things after 8 months. During the entire time I thought I was going to get committment from him but it ended on heartbreak. I blame myself for anything I did to make him not want me.  Fast forward and we're good friends. I forgave him, and after a nice break from him I got over my feelings for him. He started seeing this girl and I was fine with everything. He said he wasn't into going full on with a guy. This past Sunday he says things didn't work with this girl. It was too bad because he liked this girl. Later on he shows me a letter and says it's to his "boyfriend." My heart actually sunk and I snapped. I went off. He said they'd been seeing each other for two months and then he asked him to be his boyfriend. I was shocked. Literally. He's free to do what he wants, it's just the only that bothered me was that he was so quick to commit to this guy he met two months ago. I spent 8 whole months working on him, trying to get him to commit, and it takes this guy two months.  I went off. I cried in anger, I was sobbing uncontrollably for four hours. What did this new guy do that I didn't? Is it me? After Bill, I searched for someone to make me feel whole, loved and like I wasn't hopeless. I had met this guys in September who I though was going to be the guy to commit and after two months he just stopped talking to me.  I think I have depression and I might be bipolar (all of which hasn't been diagnosed because of how afraid I am to see someone). I've never felt lower. I just get rejected and then Bill commits making me plunge. I almost did something drastic to myself. Despite all the desire to end it, I stomached my pain and reached out to my dad. I didn't tell him about being gay, but I told him I needed help. But he tells me that maybe I should "pray more" because "God will fix it" and that I need to "rid [myself] of the Devil."  I finally got the courage to reach out, and it feels like it was made into a joke. I don't consider myself religious. I'm spiritual but I don't believe in God (if that makes sense). I prayed to him since I was 12 to make the desires for other boys go away, and since I was 15 to make my suicidal thoughts go away and to make me not so sad all the time. People say he works in mysterious ways, but making me and others like me suffer so much is plain cruel.   Despite my dad being an ass, after the holidays, I'm going to make an appointment with my doctor and take the steps nescessary to beat these feelings. Telling him gave me the strength. I just needed somewhere to say all this.

I never thought it a funny read because I loved Sharon, and at that point in the season, I could care less what the fuck PhiPhi thought about anything. That video just pisses me off. She's so unprofessional. I never liked her, and I never will no matter how much convincing someone did. She's just ugly on the inside.
I agree. It's pretty darn cute.
It's cool. I was just trying to help you out there. It was just really vague. I misspelled explanation earlier and I even checked it before I posted. We all make mistakes. No big OP.
He's cute too but I don't think this goes here
Yeah it is.
But it is funny. Where the rest though? There more to this photo that didn't get posted I guess.
Drag.  He could do drag.
I saw it, noticed it, saw who was wearing it, moved on. I'm not a fan of Alyssa.
Darn! Oh well. Thanks for letting me know though!
When I came out to my brother in November all he said was "About time you told me! I was wondering when you were going to do that." I told him because he was the only person with me when my ex broke up with me, via text. It was so great to tell him! Made me and my brother so close.
Totally not a sand crab
*shit*
Not wtf but I have to say its sort of clever.
*goose
Even though I like Michelle, upvote for you!
WHAT STOP WHISPERING FAGET
THIS IS SPACEDICKS FAGET WE ONLY USE CAPS LOCK OTHERWISE YOU'RE FUCKING WHISPERING LIKE A FAGET, FAGET
Sorry about that. But a simple "hey this is a repost" would've sufficed you fucker.
Yeah, with no explanation your picture makes absolutely no sense. But since I now know, I can say she's stupid.
Agreed
She doesn't have a home. Alderaan was destroyed by the Death Star. Thanks for bringing it up...She was finally getting over it.
There are very few things I wouldn't do to this man. He gets me so aroused just by looking at him!
Thank you!
It's definitely animal (obviously) but I can't tell what kind. It looks like a plant eater though looking at the teeth. But then again I can't for sure tell due to quality.
I give you that, but bacon. That's all I need.
This is...FANTASTIC.
I would be disappointed if I ran to get this mystical "free beer" and discovered it was just a clever way to get my attention to go inside. Then I'd just laugh and buy a beer anyway to commend them on their trickery.
