Cooking with accordion!
Would you rather clean up the poop of 100 duck sized horses or one horse sized duck?
I have them and like them. Obviously the bass response isn't as rich as a larger speaker...  when I went to the showroom to listen it was between these and the Adams.
Thursday: Global Throwdown w/ Tipsy Oxcart   Background Orcs (Funky Balkan   African)
haha I literally just did a film with the exact same perspective shift. Design aside, build the effects chain for your "deaf effect" and put it on an aux channel that returns to your main output. Then insert a send on any of your tracks that you want to morph into deafness, bussed to your new aux channel. Set it to "prefade" then you can fade down the main volume of the track, but fade up the aux send to reroute it through your effect.
Sure why not you just need an amp. All that said, these speakers aren't really going to give you a clear mix if you're doing serious audio work up close. They're more geared towards loud playback in a large entertainment venue, not precision.   Your signal chain would be:  Computer--firewire/usb--interface--very small mixing board*--2 channel amplifier--speakers  *like a Mackie 402VLZ4. Technically your interface could function also as your mixer but it's probably safer to have a mixer in there to gain stage everything correctly
You want the little fresh or pickled "bird's eye" peppers used in Thai and Indian food for CHILLI PASTE.   However what you are making is CURRY paste, which is different. For that you're best bet is **dried** puya peppers. You mash them up in a mortar and pestle with all the other stuff. Some trouble-shooting tips for 'ya are:   * When making your curry, first sautee the paste alone in oil for a bit until fragrant to cook all the raw shallots/garlic/other stuff.   * You are correct to add sugar. Best bet is to dilute **palm sugar** (not white granulated cane sugar) in a mixture or lime juice and fish sauce. Then add that to the pot to incorporate it into the paste.  Add coconut milk after.   * The boxed coconut milk is better than the canned.  * finish it all off with some unsweetened coconut cream once your protein is cooked (not cream of coconut or creamed coconut).  *I've never used it since my city has access to thai stuff, but you could try http://www.templeofthai.com/ for ingredients. I'm guessing you may have also been missing galangal and lime leaves too which makes a world of difference.

Entire Bible onstage in 1 night...
Conflict resolution
As others have said it's a mix. What's in it is up to you but I'd say cumin is generally dominant. When I make lamb kfte \ merguez I use:  * 1 1/4 teaspoons ground cumin * 1 1/4 teaspoons ground coriander (toasted) * 1/2    teaspoon ground cinnamon * 1 1/4 teaspoons fennel seeds (toasted) * 2 tablespoons harissa or ac biber salas * 3 garlic cloves, minced
In bacon grease!
looks like someone read Ruhlman's 20 ;-)
Exciting Balkan tunes from Brooklyn, NY. USA
I've travelled to the furthest reaches of [Svaneti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svaneti) and yet the biggest culture shock I've ever faced is in LAS VEGAS. It's like Mars. Last time I was there, I witnessed an interaction between a young girl who had just gotten back from a rave at around 9:30 am and and older gentleman in the elevator of the Luxor. The girl said "I too so much E and now I can't remember my room number." Then she asked the older man "are you rolling?!" and he said "Have you every heard of Jesus Christ?"
Brooklynite #2 here... "The Nelson Mandela" projects are a fictional name given to the Gowanus houses which are hardly "deep" in brooklyn (they are in cobble hill\Carroll gardens).   There was a raid there though from your friends in the DEA... http://www.brownstoner.com/blog/2010/10/huge-drug-bust/
