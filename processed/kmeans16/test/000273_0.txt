Hey man, no means no
I really enjoyed his use of "lol" and "haha" in the same text... You made him laugh out loud and electronically. Maybe he has multiple personalities?
Anybody know what day it is?
With. A. Degree. From. Fucking. Hahvahd!

Banana for scale?
Ahh, the ol' penis-in-the-hotdog-bun-trickaroo!
Fuck that! Seven years ago I had to get 40 stitches from a sack o' wet mice... cut me from the dangly thing on my ear all the way to the hard space between my chest area.  Edit: because holy shit I need more coffee

I can tell just by the way you type that you have a sexy voice... And I don't need to call her, we are both sitting here high as shit on some painkillers!
Believe it or not... This is only ONE picture!
Ditto! I used to work in a department that had a coffee club. Each week someone brought a fresh pound of whole bean to grind and brew. The only rule was to drink the coffee, no cream or sugar.
Thank you for your comment. Once again, my intention was not to point to the girl and say, "She should not be born." My intention was to poke fun at her parents, who should not be raising children in the way they do. They have turned her childhood into a reckless circus coordinated for all of the world to see. That is insensitive. That is irresponsible. But who am I? I'm just a person on the internet engaging in a discussion on what is apparently "right" and "wrong"... One thing is for sure though, the last thing I am ever going to do, is be all sensitive about things I see on the internet. I appreciate your opinion, I feel you have a valid argument... And with that, have a nice day. I have to get back to raising my children with love and kindness and to teaching them to have a sense of humor about life and all of it's oddities... Including other people.
Bad Luck Brian my ass! That is dumb as fuck [Insert Alliterative Name Here]!
Tried to post in /r/gaming but it wouldn't show up and mods never replied to my message...  So I was cleaning the floors in our bedroom and pulling all of the shit out from under our bed and I find these beauties in a box covered in dust. Now, I've never been much of a gamer, but I loved these two systems! The Game Boy Color still works, however, the screen on the Game Gear is not working. I can hear sound and barely see an image if I hold screen at an angle. Can it be repaired cheaply and easily?  Also (sorry).... What is this? Can I connect the Game Gear to my TV or monitor? http://imgur.com/JVbpcDu
This is in no way structurally similar to "Carolina Drama"... the song never reaches a climax of head-banging proportions like "Little Black Submarines".  And just for the record, neither The White Stripes nor The Black Keys were on the radar when they were putting out their early albums.  EDIT: I am referring to the mainstream radar, by the way.
