ayy lmao
Godlike,  superheros manifest during WW2 it has a chronology with dates and  events.  The first one was a german flier who Hitler hugged and declared the first Aryan.
Nooo :'C
[Wild Talents 2e] tell me about your games
Perfectly normal, perfectly healthy.  aha!
How does a human turned statistic look like?
Give me weird superpowers   The weirdest superpowers you would like to have   and how you would use it.  1 power per post(not person),please.
Thnks.
Yes,Yes,YES!
[The Flash]I wanna start reading about Barry Allen starting from how he got his superpowers and then on forward.   Pretty much what's in the title remakes and stuff are also welcome but please tell me if there are differences from the original, thanks in advance.
Yeah it's just that feeling you get when see someone's elses thought on how he looked.
I don't wanna explain too much bcause it might go against lore and have it all go down the drain.  On the other hand it's a metaplane  yeah i'l just introduce some more people maybe some animals that were also caught in the blast and they'le meet while climbing the tower  "I haven't seen the tower light up in a long time" could the spirit say.  how do we get out?  "if you want to technobabble talk to the one who's in charge of it"
Was thinking more of castlevania and Dark tower but that fits it somehow aswell
Yes i had the same idea to have trouble while passing by in earth dawn the gate spell had a strong spirit guarding it that was better to run by then defeat the same could apply to this but things that you run into while reaching your destination.  I mean shape change as in metagamic kind of thing shapeshift into a sentient puddle or turn your fist intl solid metal and stuff of thr like the same i have thougbt about the character loosing his sense of identity nothing like trying to change sex and critical glitch i would maybe make it so when you glitch either the spell warps or you are stuck with what you tried to change into for a while even alien hand syndrome if applicable. I'm typing all of this on my phone so sorry for the grammar.
Thanks i missed that.
I suggest posting some examples.
Chocking up when GMing.   how often does it happen to you?  i did it all the time worst was with gurps and nwod i just freeze when i have to come up with stuff on the spot ,encounters are by far the worst experiences i had, maybe i'm just not made for GMming   stating up stuff just stops the game and the players just stare and that's when the doodoo hits the fan in a panic i just blurr out something stupid and try to go around the issue in the stupidest ways as in nwod i just rolled for health and hit die for combat. or had to bail them out because i threw a monster too strong that they couldn't handle i guess in that aspect it's their fault aswell for not trying to go beyong i have stick and want kill dragon hit dragon with stick until dead.
Nobilis chuck the "estates" away if nevessary.
Would i be able to play as a character made for Nobilis (As in the players are incarnations of an aspect of reality ie: fire, swords,cats-with-blue-eyes,etc?) the characters are IMMENSlY powerful beings limited to their resources (miracle points) that can only be recharged when they role-play well(It' kinda tricky to get them back so most just hoard them for a long long time).   some of them are immortal tough as in immortal cannot die kind of way.  they have complete control over their aspect (if they can spend the MP for it) BUT they also must protect it otherwise he will get weaker and weaker until that aspect is completly removed from existence.  and some have items or abilities that are very powerful but also cost MP to use.  i think it'd be fun mortal characters interacting with characters like that striking deals with "Gods" and such.  Could this be the dat where i find a Sandbox game that allows me to play with my characters from Nobilis?  If you'd like more details or wanna discuss things feel free to do ask.
FU?
Sell me on Risus   looks cool enough  My favorite rpg is Nobilis would this be a good alternative?
Is creating characters on the fly easy?
Traveller i hear is pretty complex and yet it's one of the most beloved games.
ELI5: IP adressing and IP classes   i don't understand the math or reason behind both.
This black pony sounds suspiciously like Cr1Tikal
It says on the official page one of the reviews say that it's similar to Nobilis, that's why i said that.
How powerful can a rifts character become?
How powerful can a character be?
that's a good point too particular event or people.
[discussion] What makes something epic/legendary ? (armor,spell,weapon etc)   To you guys aside from stats what characteristics makes something considered epic or legendary and plz no answer like "story" please give an answer with some dept, if you want to use something you made as example i'm all for it.  As of now the characteristics i got are  Uniqueness  Means and stakes of obtaining it  Background story  The better, the worst, as in it's good but it's power comes at a price.  A connection to a certain event or people
It looks really sleek, i like colored sheets,dude i would advise making a black and white one and a colored one i fucking love this design! keep it up!
Help me come up with a magic system for Fate core.   So i have been trying to make a magic system for fate core and this is by no means finished it's just an idea and i'm trying to get the idea of it before the mechanics, here's what i have in mind.  i thought of magic working like the materia from FF7 as in switch them and make them stronger through use, i have taken the habit to go to the super power wiki and taking a look at the powers and checking them out  Let me give you an example let's say the gm gives a player the following Materias:  Fire manipulation.  Then he chooses the applications  Applications would be the uses of the power you start with two of those and with milestones in game you would give the Materia (i'l get to that) access to more application, of course the gm dictates what is "legal" as an application because some of them have applications that could ruin a game.  So the players chooses these as he would choose aspects of sorts:  Create/Generate/increase,shape. (this counts as one, the gm might think otherwise tough)  Flame Solidification.  and he would choose stunts called techniques if he wants for ways to use these powers with greater mastery such as Pyrokinetic Constructs for flame solidification.  that's what i got for this step, it's not very well translated from what i have in mind but it's an approximation  Now i thought this stuff is way too op and it is ,so i decided that using Materia recklessly would make you go insane instead of using a mana sort of thing.  When a player fails to cast a Materia properly he rolls a skill that the gm finds appropriate, the player is encouraged to give suggestions to the gm as in what skill he should roll, to circumvent a disaster.  the gm says what could happen as in what the calamity would be either bad for the caster or for people around him.  Example: The Player with the fire Materia tries to fling a fireball at someone,he rolls, he fails , so the gm says "well, you have a big fireball in your hand and it's about to blow up in your face and burn everyone around you, you lost control of the flames."  The player might suggest "i want to use my WILL to stop the flame from blowing up by concentrating to appease the flames "   The gm agrees, next time this happens he might choose another way the spell could go wrong always withing the powers of the Materia tough. the player rolls he succeeds but what if he had failed? well the player could use a fate point to negate any negative implications or endure the consequences, this might seem way to cruel but with the appearance of more powerful Materias this is a must.  But of course the gm is expected to offer worse implications to botching a power of greater magnitude as in things getting way way worse for having greater power means greater possible destruction.  Botching a spell completely makes everything go bat-shit crazy and that includes you for a while it scales with level of failure.  I have more but what do you guys think as of now?
