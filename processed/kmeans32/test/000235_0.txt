I'm telling Mrs. Higglesnatch about what you two did. You're in serious trouble Prendar!      Wazoo.
[I like how these three comments] (http://i.imgur.com/qiH6aOu.png) show that he's wrong about what he just said too.   He talked shit about hats. Downvotes are expected here.   He used the term 'retarded' which is an insensitive term in most cases, including and especially when it comes to hats.   And then there's a comment with upvotes because he was correct.      There are comments with ~-30 points, while the other ones have ~-5. If people truly did downvote all his posts there would be more consistent negative comments.      He even asked why something was being downvoted when clearly it was because he claimed to be able to "jump into any online fps and not be a noob" and that "not everyone starts out a noob" which is one of the stupider things I've seen there.      This dude clearly doesn't understand much.
I want to make a joke about the dude who uses this sub named Frontier_Justice, but I have no jokes left.

Change three uncommon cosmetics. Big Steel Jaw of Summer Fun, Bolshevik Biker and Flip Flops could be three to think of if you wanted to make a Heavy model reskin for just you.
That Pyro is a Spy!
A Heavy in MvM admits to using hacks, what do you do?   Do you stay for an easy win? Do you leave because you have your morals?      I personally just want to get a random ass Australium and some KS Kits so I'd stay. But I fully understand leaving or refusing to kick.
Omg dude you use the :] face too? This is amazing I thought I was alone!

Sorry about your items and all, but why do account hijackers take such stupid items sometimes? I've been hacked before and they took like 4 ref worth of uniques and a strange weapon while all my cosmetics were safe. This dude took most of the cool stuff and... A unique Degreaser? And two backgrounds?      Anyway the Amby is pretty good if you're a good aimer, I'm more a fan of using the Enforcer because Kritzkrieg is disgusting on that. 144 crits? Forget about it, more than I ever needed.
What an odd request that is, if KonKitty doesn't sell you them I can get you some.
What did the Scout say to the Soldier?   Who cares what he said, there's too many puns to hear what was said. Please return to /r/tf2dadjokes
I can tell you what I'm saying, I'm saying Happy Cakeday.
The problem with that is, you'd need to give damage falloff to the stock, which it does kind of need, but it would change Demo drastically if he wasn't a direct pills only kind of guy. If there was an added Grenade Launcher with +projectile speed and -something I would use the hell out of it, I like hitting shots more than killing, it just feels better.
Some of these Medics... HELLO, NURSE!
**Airu Blastu**
I'm going to upvote because you got me there, but I did say weapon so I'm still basically right. Which is strange because I wore both of those +Buckaroo's Hat for like 5 weeks.

I know I know, but it's so satisfying to see "wow dude that was just cruel" and "DAMN SON YOU NEED SOME ICE FOR THAT BURN!?" and on occasion I see "[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_burn_centres_in_cp_Dustbowl] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)"
[Now all I need is, oh I don't know, another 20 keys for an Amaranthine hat! I guess it's time to sell my sack!] (https://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/5/5c/Medic_mvm_loot_godlike02.wav?t=20131122053937)
It isn't really true like this though, Sniper can right click then left click for an instant 150 damage, killing most classes in one hit. Scout's speed is countered by the Engineer, Medic isn't the only class that can heal, you are correct in saying it is the easiest but Engineer and Heavy can do it too. There's also health kits but whatever. Being fast means nothing when you're facing a good Sniper. Healing isn't possible when you've been killed by a good sniper. Even a Heavy isn't safe if the sniper can hold his horses for a minute.
Spy is a soft counter to everything in this game, his sappers only break your guns if you're not near them or if you're dead. If you're dead then Soldiers and Demos can take it out anyway, and they can kill you easier than a Spy.      I'm speaking from past experience by the way. I've hardly ever had trouble from spies.
I see what you're getting at, but potentially there could always be another Burning Team Captain waiting inside that crate #4 you have sitting around, or a Sunbeams Killer Exclusive. Although it is much more likely that you would get the kritz/awp, you will 99% of the time get utter garbage.
Ooh, dude you might want to give up on that before you get too far into it, as much as I love the idea of it, I don't think Valve would want a taunt added to the game that removes the Pyro's mask.
Jealous.

If I'm playing Medic....   Feel free to yell (Voice)MEDIC! Because that's what I'm here for, to heal you in your darkest of times. If you're on full health, yell out to me anyway, an overheal is indispensable these days. (get it? Because a dispenser can't give you an overheal. I thought it was pretty funny.) If you're a Baby Face's Blaster Scout then I'll heal you in a couple of seconds, You're a pretty quick guy. If you picked up a health kit when I'm on low health then I'll give you a quick overheal and wait for it to come back, When I'm on fire and you're a Pyro, I don't hate you for not airblasting, you might not know how to do that, maybe you don't know it puts out a player, and I'm fine with that. But I swear to god if you wear a Lime Green or Pink loadout I will never heal you. Because Y'all look stupid.
