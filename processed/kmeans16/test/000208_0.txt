Harper Lees recipe for cracklin cornbread   **Harper Lees recipe for cracklin cornbread**  First, catch your pig. Then ship it to the abattoir nearest you. Bake what they send back. Remove the solid fat and throw the rest away. Fry fat, drain off liquid grease, and combine the residue (called cracklings) with: 1  cups water-ground white meal 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon baking powder 1 egg 1 cup milk Bake in very hot oven until brown (about 15 minutes). Result: one pan crackling bread serving 6. Total cost: about $250, depending upon size of pig. Some historians say this recipe alone fell the Confederacy.
