It's very interesting to me how increasingly often, recently, we'll target the body's pieces that are being taken advantage of by a pathogen rather than the actual pathogen. The body isn't about to change to blockers like the pathogen can in response to antivirals or antibiotics.
Not all deserts are bad, just the ones like those that are growing in western/central China
I get shocked a lot, despite moving to a much more humid climate
That was going to be my exact comment.
Or Arizona
I used to always buy Intel, and it worked great. Still works great. My 7.5 year old laptop still runs very manageably for most things, including 720P video (1080P is a bit of a struggle). Then I read an article about how much of an asshole they are when I was working on an HTPC about a month ago. I went with AMD (they also have better integrated graphics IMO) and it's been running amazing and was probably half the price of a comparable Intel chip
No, it doesn't. If, for example, an army base has no walls or security than another army base, but people are trying to get into the other army base more often, it does not mean the first base is more secure. It means that fewer people want to get in. While that does mean a lower chance of being compromised, as you say, that does not mean more secure.  More secure means that if there is an attack, or whatever, you can block it and not be compromised. Maybe that's through being more difficult to infiltrate or some other method, but a simple lack of attacks does not mean more secure
Being in a rental, I think I have only CFL or LEDs, definitely not incandescent. I'm not sure how to tell the difference cause I can't see the inside (where the CFL coils would be) cause they're all frosted
Such a good boy!!!
It's a quick read, and enjoyable, but don't set expectations cause you'll be wrong. It's not a bad thing, it's just not Kvothe's perspective so you have to expect it to be very different.
Title is definitely misleading
As someone who just moved out of one of those cities and into one not on that list...I have made a terrible mistake
Knowing people who did it and paid for more than I did (I had auto insurance/cell phone covered by parents cause it was convenient and didn't cost them much extra) it's quite possible.  Basically make your own food as much as possible and avoid going out, don't get TV; stick with Netflix, avoid movie theaters.  Traveling is kind of out of the picture, except maybe once per year as is new technology.  Also, live somewhere cheap.  I lived in Tucson where the $15K-$25K stipend is enough. If you pick a place like New York, it won't be and that'll be difficult.
In my experience with 3D printed materials, the layers are not laid down perfectly flat on one another and there is a capillary force that pulls liquids through (this applies to FDM, I have no experience with other technologies).  It's possible that if the plastic was heated a little bit closer to being in a liquid state rather than closer to being in a solid state as it is laid down that this might solve the problem, but then things might get runny.   Also that there is a scaffold interior instead of a solid material isn't going to help with the out gassing problem (I'm assuming you mean the gas in the interior of the part is coming out of the part not the material itself is off gassing). Perhaps if a part was printed solidly it would be less noticeable as the space would be filled with material.
Do you mind some old PDFs from when I took a SolidWorks class?    Also, check out www.vertanux1.com  I've been learning PTC Creo from him and he's been great.  Maybe check out the final/midterm for SolidWorks/Inventor (or whatever he has, I've been focused on Creo).
Guess I'm watching Scarface for the first time ever tonight
