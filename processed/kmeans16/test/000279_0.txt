Yes
Saw it yesterday and I am already planning on seeing it again. It was soo good!!!! I was laughing and in tears throughout the whole movie I LOVED it!!!!!!! From the hospital scene onward I was in tears pretty much.
OMG I was about to post this!!!!!! Yes I remember wandering into the adult section and seeing that once and it scared the crap out of me. It still kind of gives me the willies when I think about it.
UGH I wish I had seen it in IMAX I was jobless at the time though and by the time I got a job and money The Hobbit had already started playing, to make up for it I saw it in a regular theater in one of the first few rows.
cool.
5 or 6 per week and at least 2 a week in the cinema I also keep track of every movie I watch there I have for the last 5 years.  I like ALL types of movies but my favorites are action and comedy. I like current movies like made in the last 10 years but occasionally I will watch something from the 80s or 90s.  Last 5 were Submarine, Zero Dark Thirty, Selena, Iron man, and The Last Five years.
LOL
Id make The Mandarin the villain he was supposed top be. Just have Killian be the brain guy and have Ben Kingsleys character do everything including kill maya and fight with tony at the end. Also his plan is to start a world war by making it look like the president was killed by some other country or something.
I liked it and TBH I have no freakin idea if she is from the future or not.
Thank you
here here.
Yes hes a villain but not really if ya know wat I mean. Plus he tried to call it off too but was too late.
OMG YES!!!!!!!!!
Mostly cuz he is a part of a worldwide Cult but aside from that I like him he is a good actor and I have only seen him in a few bad movies.
Ah man I was gonna say that one, but yeah thats true.
OMFG   Go the hell to bed now!!!!! You have literally been sitting there for 13 freakin hours!!!! Give someone else a shot on the tv now!!!!
