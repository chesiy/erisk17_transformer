Sounds tempting, got any pics?
It blends in my blender bottle really well, it just separates a within a few minutes so I down it pretty quickly.
This is my favorite answer here.

[SV] I FREAKING LOVE KETO!! Helllllooo Onederland!!   F / 5'2 / SW: 218.8 / CW: 199.8 / GW1: 170  I've been on Keto for for exactly 6 weeks today and I'm back in the 100's for the first time since August 2014!!  Since March 8th I've lost 19 lbs on the nose which is just unreal, both because of the short time and the fact that I used to be a die hard carb addict.  Here's the thing: I "cheat". Ive had a few slices of pizza, I've been eating chocolate since Easter, and I eat things without logging them first and later regret it when I do log it, thinking my whole day is ruiuned. But I KCKO, and I never once got "kicked out of keto." I kept losing weight. When you have a bad day, don't freak out and give up. KCKO is a saying around here for a reason!! Even if you screw up, DON'T GIVE UP!! You are still going to do great. The only way you won't reach your goal is if you quit trying.  I know it's hard when you're having a bad day, so look at some progress pics (yours or others), maybe plan what your next few meals will be, relax, and have faith in the system and the system will take care of you.  Lastly, and most important; please don't let the scale define your self worth. The scale is a 4 digit representation of your relationship with gravity. Losing weight is fantasict for your overall health and can make you so much more confident but no matter what it says, you must believe you are an amazing, beautiful person because YOU ARE!!   Good luck, I hope you reach every goal you've set for yourself and live a healthy, happy life!

Thank you so much!
It's actually a relief to read this. I'm on day 2 and I know I'm not going to see weight loss *yet*, but I'm fearful of being the rare person to not lose any. Reading all the success stories can almost seem too good to be true, so it's nice to know that if one falters, it's worthwhile to stick with it. Thank you for sharing your experience!!
Sorry, no magic here!! I made them at home, using nutritiondata.com for the nutritional content, but I put into MPF that I used *all* 2 pounds in 1 taco, then x how many tacos I ate. I feel like such a dope! I fixed it and I'm still over for the day because I had steak for lunch, but it's *so much closer!*
That makes me feel way better, there's no way I ate a whole pound of meat in those tacos. I'll look into it and see where I can find the mistake, and I'll be vigilant of weighing everything instead of relying on food I search for on MPF's database.
Thank you for the info and the support! Today I did pretty good on water, I'm looking into how to more adequately supplement electrolytes. I definitely do not want to feel that flu at work!
My friend just posted this picture of her dog sleeping
I just imagined OP trying to throw the snow back up into the sky.
Hell yeah, Geaux Cajuns!
Wow this is exactly what I needed! Thank you so much for the in depth advice, I'm going to employ it as best as I can. It reminds me of some bad advice a friend gave me...she got on me cause I said I would "try", and by doing that I am deliberately setting myself up for failure and giving myself after way out. as you said, I'd rather be prepared for the inevitable slip-up than promise to NEVER mess up again and hate myself when I do.  Thank you again. As soon as my situation allows I'll try to find someone in my area who can help!
Wow humans are fucking gross
I can't tell if I have an E.D but I'm starting to worry about myself...   (I don't even know if this is the right thread so sorry if it isnt.)  My husband has noticed this behavior, too. For example, today I finished up a Diet Bet and won, so my husband wanted to celebrate with eating ANYTHING I wanted for dinner. I opted for pizza. I got my own large stuffed crust pizza and after restricing ate the whole goddamn thing by myself. I felt so so shitty afterwards, and if I hadn't recently gotten my wisdom teeth pulled I fear would dislodge the blood clots, I would have purged. I've never done this before and couldn't cause vomiting would have caused the blood clots to dislodge.   Anyway I do shit like this sometimes. I don't want to claim I have a problem with a restriction and binging cycle, I don't want give myself excuses or be dramatic about overeating when other people have serious problems...I just can't tell and I don't have the funds to see a professional about this.  Anyone have any tips or resources they're willing to share so I can get my shit together? I'm going to start another diet bet tomorrow and I don't want to keep doing this to myself. I just keep self-sabotaging and getting in my own way.  EDIT: Was missing the majority of a clarifying sentence. Oops. Posting on mobile is hard.
Lol that is pretty weird, but hey whatever works!! I'm up for giving it a try. Trying on jeans and standing in front of the mirror are two things that I do from time to time and they work in a really unfortunate way.  The night I posted this my husband was working late and I did miss him, so maybe there's some truth to that. I'll let him know it's his fault ASAP.
Fonts. Fucking fonts
The day my best friend told me he was moving out of our house, I wish I would have talked him out of it. He killed himself in his new apartment leas than a month later. Turned out he planned it pretty far in advance but I feel like I could have saved his life if I had tried harder to make him stay.
Inception and The Dark Knight.  Fantastic soundtracks.
I relate so much to the second dog so much it hurts
That's great advice! I can't imagine how nervous I'll be on race day, but I will try to remember to take it all in and document my time. And ill try to remember to take my time and walk if i need to. I really thought if i tried hard enough i could run the whole thing but I admit my expectations were a little unrealistic.  I've always dreamed of being a runner, so hopefully this will be my first of many races! Thank you for the advice!
Unfortunately this is completely normal here in the US

It would be fucking impossible to get Taco Bell at 3 am
For all you know I myself am a stripper, or I have children that are and support them even if I don't agree with them. I've got an idea; How about we don't project our personal feelings on a given subject onto one another, insisting the other is wrong and we are right? Deal? *Hint* THAT is liberalism. Live and let live.
The biggest thing I think he's missing here is that just because his friend or people like him may not have laid a hand on an underage person, but someone else had to in order to create the content he's "harmlessly" viewing. He didn't do the abuse, but someone with a camera has to in order to catch those vile images. This perpetuates the market for such images and videos. Other sick people are fulfilling a need created by these 60 year old white guys. Cut off the demand, the supply withers and dies and no more children are harmed.  Edit: phrasing
He makes it seem so effortless he might as well be doing the waltz
