I was 12 years old, never did drugs, but I encountered a very malicious presence in my grandmother's house.    It wasn't something I could see, but no matter how much I tried to convince myself I was just crazy and there wasn't actually anything there, the presence felt like pure evil and *made* my body react in such a way that I became filled with terror and flight.  My rational mind was literally just like what the ever loving fuck is going on?    I've heard of people who have a certain instinct that tells them something is wrong when they can't actually discern what it is, and this was just one of those times.  My body and instincts were telling me to *get the fuck away* from whatever was there, except that it was blocking the only doorway out of the kitchen.  Nothing happened, but it felt like it wanted to kill me.  It irrationally made me fear for my safety in a certain way.  The part that really cemented the idea of it being a demon of some sort instead of a panic attack, was that the feeling of apprehension and fear within me *didn't gradually wear off.  Its exit was as instantaneous as it had come*.  I didn't realize just how heavy the atmosphere had felt until 'it' left.  The room then felt so light again, and I was filled with relief.  I imagine the whole ordeal probably would have looked like I was insane to an outsider; I was crying and praying to god and trying to melt into the back counter.  It was both the strangest and scariest thing that has ever happened to me in my life.    The experience itself *did* happen to me.  The part that nobody would believe is that it was a demon.  I can't tell you with fact that it was a demon, but I can tell you that it felt like there was a malicious presence there, and I personally associate the idea of a 'malicious presence' with a demon.  I guess it could have been some kind of temporary, one time, vivid emotional hallucination.  I don't know.  I don't go chasing after ghosts and the supernatural.  Nothing like that has ever happened again, thankfully.
YOU BOYS LIKE MEXICO? **YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO**
Oh yeah, *black liquorice*, another candy I hate  :P
Do you think it's because our daydreams are like an idealized version of reality?  For me, it's a place where I am far stronger than I really am; that's the most important part.  I find myself looking toward society with a certain degree of apprehension.  I notice a lot of conflict and discord.. so being able to retreat within myself provides a sort of safe covering from society and a sort of buffer from my social anxiety.    I look at myself in reality and am disappointed with the person I have become.  The person in my daydreams has lots of friends but minus the conflict... but they're also super idealized versions of people, people that just can't exist.  Wishing for things that can't exist is quite exhausting, I agree.  I want to be willing to accept reality, but it seems very far off right now.
Hey I don't have anything cute that's neo related, [but will this work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6D6Xd3wCHE) (headphones and hd for best experience)  :3
[Y-yay!](https://otomeohmy.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/tumblr_mcav3y9sao1qc7dbso1_500.gif)  I like friends~  Sure, I'll PM you  :3
The way he raises his pitch gradually throughout is hilarious
DAMMIT I ALWAYS MISS THAT BITCH
lol I think it's a joke because of what's happening today
There is none, it never actually got released.  So I can't dress it up in dress to impress lol
He was willing to wait for me to be ready for sex, but I ended the relationship because I did not want to give him that impression.  I knew I would never want to be intimate with him like that, so I broke it off to avoid pulling him along.  I say that like it was a simple thing, but it was terribly sad.    Honestly, I'll not even consider dating another person unless they're asexual.  ):  It's just there aren't many asexual people out there, so the chances of me being alone are pretty high.
Fuck, if the [notice board](http://www.neopets.com/noticeboard.phtml) was still in working order I'd tell you to spend a couple mil to put up a notice at the top.  IMO that would be the best way to get someone's attention at this point  xD  But that's incredibly unconventional and silly.  What else is there to do?  It'd be better than a ticket, since it's not on-site related and Rico S. just closes them anyway...  ^^^I ^^^still ^^^can't ^^^have ^^^my ^^^gold ^^^kau  ^^^:c
lol I'd do it haha
263  :o
Not all pets had an unconverted option, unfortunately.  You probably just happened to have those pets  ):
