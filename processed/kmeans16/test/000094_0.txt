I read a lot about the online world before I could afford a computer, so my introduction was gradual; I knew a couple of people on BBSs and they showed me around a little.  Funny story: While gathering information I learned about the WELL, so I called their office (this would be about '94) and asked someone to send me an info packet. He sounded very apologetic when he said "I'll be sending this through the mail, so it will take a couple of days to reach you. Is that OK?"
"I'm doing OK for an old fat guy."  "Oh, you're not old!"
Grizzly bears have claws and teeth and are considerably larger than gorillas. I suspect a gorilla who saw an angry Kodiak bear would NOPE out of there in a heartbeat. Gorillas and strong and smart but at a huge physical disadvantage.
Nah, I memorized this years ago; don't remember where I first heard it. This is the first time I've gotten to actually use it anywhere (hence its presence in the "useless" thread).
C'mon, it'll be fun! Who knows where we'll end up?
In FW there's a stretch of Magnolia street that has a bunch of good restaurants. There's even a vegan place that for my money has the best food in the area, and I'm not vegan.   If you can find a taco place that makes its own tortillas, go to town. There's nothing like a fresh taco on a tortilla that's only about a minute old. (Soft tacos are the norm; I'm not even sure where you could get a crunchy taco besides Taco Bell.)
It sounds as if you want to say "The experience has made me a much better person" but you don't feel that way. It's OK, it's early in the process. Reading some of the stories in this thread, some of them sound as if the light just came on and they were cool people all of a sudden. I can assure you, it didn't happen that fast. It never does. We all have to *learn* to be good people, over the course of weeks and months and years. You feel like the Guy Who Did That Shitty Thing; eventually you'll feel like the Guy Who Grew From That Shitty Thing. It won't be tomorrow, but it will be before too long.
As /u/chass3 said, north and northwest are your best bets, but everyone else knows it too, so empty spaces are scarce. Also, some neighborhoods have resident-only parking to discourage commuters, so check the signs carefully. Depending on how far away you're coming from, it may be less hassle to park farther away near a bus or shuttle stop and ride in the rest of the way.
Thanks, you too!
Interesting, I take almost the opposite approach. I:  * don't use shampoo or soap above the neck, and my skin is nice and smooth and soft as a result. * don't use shaving soap or cream. I don't even use water. I grab the razor as soon as I'm out of the shower and get to work. (This order is crucial; if I wait even 10 minutes, things get rough.)  * only shave once; it's all that's needed.  It took a while before my skin got used to dry shaving, and in the meantime I experimented with oil instead of cream or soap; it worked fine, but it gunked up my razor. At some point I just wondered what would happen if I didn't use anything at all, so I tried it and liked it.  Possibly relevant: I use a double-edge safety razor, not one of those multiblade replaceable-head ones. It took a bit of getting used to, but now I wouldn't use anything else. One key is to be gentle and not use much pressure.
As falls Wichita, so falls Wichita Falls.  The one in Kansas.
The what now?
I love this.

I thought trees made the wind blow. The trees would start moving and the wind would start blowing ... I had to be told that it happened in the other order.  Similarly, I thought when it rained somewhere, it rained everywhere.
Fred Phelps the head of the clan was a respected civil-rights lawyer before the nuttiness began. He had a lot of friends in the local legal community for a long time after he went all holy war; don't forget that anti-gay sentiment has always run deep among blacks in this country. If he had been Fred Phelps the Actuary he probably wouldn't have lasted long.
