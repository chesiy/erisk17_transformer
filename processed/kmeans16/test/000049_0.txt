10mg n,n-DMT vs 40mg   Im 120lbs and I heard that low doses of DMT seem to almost always induce a bad experience and that trippers should go for a breakthrough dose such as 30mg-40mg and that it isn't scary once you are in the experience. I am aware that it is one of the most potent substances and my only experience is with acid and shrooms. I want to test the waters since I don't know what my reaction to DMT will be like.  What is your suggested dosage? to those who are experienced with dmt
Yeah thats creating a personalized one, I am looking for a way to get the big ones out of the way so you can see interesting posts from all subreddits
My opinion from an existential standpoint:  Be warned that what is written below is very colloquial and is poorly focused on the structure that calculating and strictly logical people are used to, I refer not to the link underneath but everything after this sentence.  http://www.philosophybro.com/2010/12/nietzsches-thus-spoke-zarathustra.html[1]  After reading this and spending a lot of time with interpretations of nietzsche and satre as well as reading their well known books the idea hit me like a drop of water on my forehead.  The kind of freedom nietzsche was talking about can be understood by first looking at this statement.  "You **know** what happiness is" that's fucking right, don't consult the internet, or a friend or analyse a successful person and find out what next good decision etc etc. No YOU decide. When leaving behind religion and embracing doubt, embracing science we still don't have the kind of freedom neitzsche had in mind. This is because we doubt ourselves in the same way that we now doubt the religion we discarded, we need to consult science before making a decision as if it's the boss.  You are the fucking boss. "Don't be so egocentric?" Fuck off. You call the shots, you roll the dice, you decide when you are happy, you decide what will make you happy, you are a free spirit and therefore you have the power.

haha, i have a rule of thumb, ask the question, why should I do that? rather than; why not?  What good evidence is there for me to eat grains? viola

How do I get more, "Why didn't I think of that earlier?" situations where your brain becomes a genius for 1 minute?   I was trying to deposit from special savings account 1 into term deposit 2 because of a slightly better rate. Special savings accounts give you a ton of more interest if you make one deposit and no withdrawals for that month. (it's a condition for those types of accounts)  ------------------------------------   I spent days doing the math trying to figure out if I would lose more or gain more if I transferred money from the special account to the term deposit since the rate is higher on the term deposit but you violate the special account rule where you can't make a withdrawal for the month.   -----------------  Today I spent ages talking with an employee, we finally did the complex maths and I was about to come to my decision of transferring it at the expense of about $200 worth of extra interest (I would lose $200 very bad idea) because of violating the withdrawal rule.  Suddenly clarity in my mind.  --------------------------------------  If I transfer money from special account 1 to my term deposit I will not get extra interest on special account 1 for that month.  I can transfer all of the remaining money from special account 1 to special account 2 which will then give me extra interest for that month thus saving my ass from flushing $200 down the toilet.  -------------------------------------  A simple solution to such a complex situation. I got relief and fear at the same time thinking "what if that never occurred to me?"I got to make sure this happens more often.
Then it cried out of me; "Bite! Bite its head off! Bite!" Thus it cried out of me  my dread, my hatred, my nausea, my pity, all that is good and wicked in me cried out of me with a single cry.   The shepherd, however, bit as my cry counseled him; he bit with a good bite. Far away he spewed the head of the snake  and he jumped up. No longer shepherd. no longer human  one changed, radiant,   * *** laughing! Never yet on earth has a human being laughed as he laughed! O my brothers, I heard a laughter that was no human laughter; and now a thirst gnaws at me, a longing that never grows still. My longing for this laughter gnaws at me; oh, how do I bear to go on living! And how could I bear to die now!***  -Thus spoke zarathusra Nietzsche     Edit: Has anyone ever gotten two top comments on a reddit post hahahahaahahahahahaha
I think i've gotten to the point in life where i''m so used to every day life that it doesn't feel real or serious anymore, a bit like derealization but not a disorder more natural, i've gotten so used to life that it doesn't feel real anymore, it's like i'm always dreaming, and i've become more abs   tract and philosophical rather than concrete, more intuitive than sensing  something wrong? i've been like this for around 3 years now  i'm 18 and i have anxiety

I'm not even close to a relapse   did you read this?  I'm not about to relapse, i'm just saying that I wish I had the teenage boy like urge to go after women btw i've been covering my junk with saran wrap to restore sensitivity in the glans because of circumcision, you think blocking of the meatus could make someone unintentionally successful at nofap because it is blocking the path of least resistance, the person wouldn't have to overcome and grow over their urges either so that might be bad?
If we cut back from such pleasures, less pleasure chemicals related to such tasks would be involved, less chemicals means more receptors which means improved quality of life?
If we suddenly cut back on all superstimuli, over time what kind of people will we become? Will we be better in general? e.g. I am choosing to read a book over watching a tv show, reading a book will help strengthen my attention span, and isn't overloaded with sounds, visuals and fast paced action, so it's more calm and contemplative
