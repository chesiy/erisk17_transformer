You are factually incorrect. To quote the text of the 10th Amendment: "The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."  It says nothing about the powers not EXPLICITLY granted to the federal govt being reserved for the states. Therefore, any implied powers are also reserved for the federal govt. Since the power to regulate marriage on the basis of sex has been implied by the majority opinion today, it is therefore deemed to have been one of the powers of the federal govt since the 14th Amendment passed, on which the decision is based.
On the flip side, if anyone ever does this and you DON'T have a dashcam, just gesture towards your windshield and say you do. Maybe they'll freak out and leave. You'll still be stuck with your damage, but that's better than the other guy's as well, b/c 99/100 they would rule you responsible in this situation.
Because you don't change it by voting for your favorite candidate. Think of it this way: if there's a democrat you're meh on, an independent you love, and a republican you hate- and you (and enough others) vote for the independent, causing the republican to win where the democrat otherwise would have- then the republicans are in charge and your arugment is that this will somehow be a message to them to change the voting system? Maybe it will, but wouldn't they be completely disincentivized from changing the system because they won in the current system?  You need to change the electoral system before you abide by its voting rules.

RED ALERT ON PRO #2!!!  Even if the seller is an attorney, you pay your own attorney to look over the contract and advise you. He could easily write a contract with a term you don't understand and screw you over with, **especially because he's an attorney.** It will not be a big expense compared to all the other closing costs. You'll still want title insurance, a survey, and inspection (which will all be required by the bank anyways). Do not cheap out on the attorney, or it could easily come back to bit you for 10 times the cost.  Other than that, just be aware you will independently (as in without your friend) be responsible for the entire mortgage payment if the upstairs rents move out.  Also be aware of the potential costs you're taking on. Water heater/AC break? Your expense. Tenants upstairs literally begin taking axes to the walls? You'll need to take proper eviction proceedings and know how to do that (you'll need an attorney). This will require an emergency fund for the house specifically of at least $10,000.

Thanks for the insight. I think I'm just gonna have to bite the bullet and thank myself later.
And I'm arguing you that you abolish all of those programs and replace with universal healthcare. It's cheaper per capita than what we pay collectively.  As for the supplemental insurance, the point is that some people will never be happy so you give them the opportunity to pay for faster healthcare.  And for being glad to hand money over, it's something that's the right thing to do. I know because right now I'm poor and know what it's like to need resources and will be happy to support those in need. I've given substantial money to homeless who were in need when I was earning money because I could see they needed it. That's what being human is about.
It should be a thing. I don't think I, or anyone else I know, realized just how much work it would be. I had multiple law students describe it, but actually doing it was a complete wake up call to the amount of work that had to be put in.
Just to reiterate on that 2nd point, OP.  We were all young and dumb at some point in our lives. Unless we have been told before, we don't know not to talk to the cops and fully trust them as authority figures.  Yes, you told them everything which will be used against you in court, but at 17, me and any number of people on this sub who like to chide people for doing that probably would have done the same thing in your situation.  Eventually you'll be past this. As for now, the best thing you can do is hire a lawyer if you can afford one.
I'm not saying it made him fight a bad fight, only that it most likely affected him in some way. I think he would have done better if he did not have the mental aspect of nearly dying from the weight cut, and I don't see how you could argue against that.  I'm sure it was you, but whatever, deny all you want. It was minutes after my comment, deep into our comment tree when you're the only one likely to see it or with any motive to downvote. Further, you only had 1 upvote on your previous 2/3 comments, meaning if it was someone else, it's highly likely they would have downvoted me and upvoted you at the same time.
Hey I know this isn't a budget post, but just some rough advice. If I were you, I'd consider one of two options:  1) Move in with parents if they have room and allow it and put ALL available money towards the loans. Even if you are only making minimum wage, at 40 hours a week (and if your job isn't full time, get a second one), you should be earning $1100 after taxes per month. Live like a pauper on $200, and pay $900 a month towards the loans. Do this as long as you can.  2) Pick up and move to the oil fields in the Midwest or Texas, or go work on a fishing boat in Alaska. Yes it will suck and it's dangerous, but you'll clear $100K a year and have the loans paid back in 2 years.
Thank you for answering!
There are no legitimate reasons, therefore it makes the person a shitty person no matter what.  What you're saying is tantamount to someone admitting to killing their 5 year old child in a gleeful manner (which is the attitude this guy and girl gave off bragging of their cheating) and you saying you'll "wait to hear all the facts." A reasonable person can conclude that its not necessary to hear much more, and if there was a justification, the people would have said it.
Hey guys I was one of the guys he chose to help with his AMA just cause I live in Austin. He was a really cool dude! Me and the other guy just helped type up responses while he dictated, but we typed it word for word. He gave us each a signed glove and we got to see his dogs and meet his wife. He seems really down to earth. I got a pic with him, and the other guy asked Tim to give him a leg kick (there was a video, I'll let him post it if he wants).
TIFU by using my MMA skills on a mentally ill person (Long)   This happened about 4-5 hours ago. So here it is, several days after Valentines day and I'm walking on my college campus with my girlfriend to go pick up a package her mom had sent her containing lots of Valentines day candy and such.  Well we pick up the package and walk about 20 feet when out of NOWHERE a tall skinny kid about 18-20 years old comes running and grabs the package from my hands. But here's the thing, **he's maniacally laughing the entire time.** First thought that entered my mind is I'm trying to see if I know the kid from class or a club or something, nope. Quick glance to my girlfriend next to me says she doesn't know him either.  So then after about 20 seconds of trying to grab the package, he rips it open and candy goes flying everywhere. At this point, we are in the middle of the hallway in one of the busiest buildings on campus. The kid starts trying to wrestle me. Sweet. I trained in MMA for about a year, so I know some stuff. I immediately go for a trip takedown, and when he puts his hands on the floor to stand up, I sink in a rear naked choke. First  I'm not squeezing that hard, but then I get pissed thinking how much of a pain he caused me. By the way, I'm borderline sick today and the only reason I even went to school was because I had a huge test. Add this to the fact that I'm lugging around a 30 pound backpack with books, binders and laptop, and you could see why I'm pissed when someone tries this crap on me. So here I am, applying the choke, and all these college kids (about 30 or so) have formed a big circle around me and a bunch of girls start screaming that I'm gonna kill him, and I can tell I'm about to put him to sleep, so I loosen the choke.  Oh and I've got my 30 pound backpack on this whole time. I guess here is where I should mention that I'm about 5'7 and 130 pounds and this kid is about 6'0 and 200 pounds. Needless to say he's got some size on me. So I've loosened the choke, but I'm still holding it firm but not squeezing at all. The kids starts grabbing my hair and just pulling the crap out of it. The girls are still yelling that I'm gonna kill this kid. So I start arguing with them, telling them he's gonna run if I let him go. They keep screaming at me. Fine. I let go, and hold firm around his waist. He stands up and starts dragging me, while standing, trying to run away. I implore any bystanders to help, and these two big-ish guys help me hold him there.  Finally, an employee of the college shows up and informs us that the police are on their way, but he can't touch the kid. So this kid is still dragging the 3 of us around and we're trying to hold him. Finally, we agree that we'll put him on the ground. So we ground the kid and he just starts unloading punches at me, mostly top of the head, but some hit me in the jaw (which is now sore and slightly swollen). College employee jumps in and helps us hold him down til police get there.  They take, my, my girlfriend's and some other witness statements. At this point I hear a bystander mention that they know the kid and he's mentally ill. Crap, I should have realized earlier. Now the police pull me aside and start grilling me, asking me if I thought the kid was an imminent threat to me and actively trying to harm me. I point to the fact that he punched me in the head several times. Then the officer informs me that I could be arrested for applying "deadly force" in the form of the choke, which is a felony. Pshhh, I tell him, that's complete BS, dude tried to rob me.  So it ends with me telling the police that yes I'd like to press charges for assault and attempted robbery. And the police informing me that they will contact me and the kid may try to press assault charges on me. By the way, before someone complains, I'm only pressing charges because clearly this kid is either off his meds or on the wrong ones and they need to be adjusted. If his doctor informs me that they have fixed the medication and he is indeed taking them, and I get an apology from the kid, I will gladly drop the charges against him.  **tl;dr: Kid tries to rob me, I choke him, he punches me, whoops he's mentally ill, cops come and tell me I might be arrested for a felony in the near future; ALL LEGAL ADVICE WELCOME**
