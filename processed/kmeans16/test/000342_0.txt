A couple of people I know really like them, but I'm not a big fan. The first few times I sculled with them was in bad weather, and it really irritated my wrists and forearms. I had tendonitis in my wrists a couple of years ago, and it felt like the extra effort it took to square and feather started to bring that back, especially in the choppy water. I try to avoid them just to keep my wrists happy but better and more experienced scullers than me really like them.
Sounds good. I will check those channels out. Thank you!
Okay. I was just hoping for a number of lbs to add at a time or a way to figure out how much is too much. I'll start with adding 5 and see how I feel from there. Thanks.
Oh! I had no idea! That's exactly the answer I was looking for. Thank you for your contribution.
Wooooow
I think you're forgetting the mental skills required for this sport. Yes, all sports require mental skills, but rowing--particularly racing--requires some serious mental focus and toughness. Pushing your body to its absolute limits is not something your brain really wants to do, and it takes time and attention to really hone the necessary perseverance and to shut down that prominent self-preservation instinct. Don't neglect that in your considerations.
I just have a few bites of greek yogurt mixed with oats, berries, honey, and chia seeds the night before so everything is nice and soggy. Keeps me from getting hungry during practice even though I eat just a little.
How is the sizing compared to JL?
Mmmmm challah
I am jealous of every single thing
Thank you!

Also try not to just row one side.
Back and Forth (A Song About Erging)
So far we've done two 30' tests and I did worse on the second one, which is why this whole debate started. Since then I've been training with higher splits to keep my heart rate in the right zone (until the end of a piece every now and then). We have our next test tomorrow, so hopefully this will all pay off and I'll be okay.  And I don't feel like I'm killing myself at 170+ but I also don't feel like I know enough about hr zones to say that I'm okay there, because it is tiring but not that tiring. I've only been rowing for 2+ years and I've only been paying attention to my hr for the past six months. I will definitely discuss more with my coaches. Thank you so much!
I don't know what your normal workouts are like but basically yes. And then throw in some extra steady state. So maybe those two workouts and then two days of SS and then weights and whatever other stuff you do, but toned down a bit because you're erging so much. Also these workouts will give you an idea of what to shoot for. Make sure you're negative splitting; it's better for your erg times and your body.   Also the hardest part about erging is the mentality, so that's probably what you need to work on the most. Even though you know the mental erg struggle, it's been awhile and a 2k is hell. So remember that, and keep your focus while you're erging, especially through the long pieces and the last couple sprint pieces.
