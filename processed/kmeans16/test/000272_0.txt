Gotta catch em' all!
I like how the one chick at the end is all like fok you m8 I want in on this action!
Go to a vagina orchard: count 1,2,3, spin that plant around you got a third world country. That's right consider yourself warned I'm offensive and creative like handicapped porn.
My wife is taking the lil guy tomorrow. Yeah our first cat was also a rescue and was 4 weeks old. She did fine and is now majestic and free :)
It's not their relative level of danger that makes them scary. It's that the fucking slither around and are so stealthy. Always there, always watching. Snakes and spiders...the ultimate voyeurs.
ELI5: Is it just me or does not providing any support for terrorism in the last six months seem like a short time? And the "I swear we won't do it in the future either!" Seem sort of trivial? Or is it one of those things that you're not on the list until you prove otherwise?
Pretty bird!

If I dropped acid this probably would have taken me the entire night to figure out what the fucks going on
This is relevant but me and my wife saw "Into the Woods" last night. I was blown away by the sexual undertones and general themes for a 'kids movie'. There's a scene in the woods with Emily Blunt and Chris Pine where they hardcore makeout (when Blunts married with a newborn child) and carry on for 5 minutes with song about how it doesn't matter what happens since they're in the woods.   There was death and disfigurement throughout as well. Maybe its just me but it did seem a bit much for a children's movie. Just my two cents.
What the fuck?
he looks weird. Like he has a spray tan and tons of botox. Seriously get a group of guy friends and confront him like you gotta a fucking problem?! And go from there. If he still keeps up I'd take it to the cops or take matters into my own hands. My two cents.
Actually I stay on no sleep and whatever's on the front page. I'm sure it's good though I was only thinking via writing. Hah. I read one about that wasn't my husband I slept with last night and that took half the day at work lolol winning
Whatever is inhabiting your brothers body is probably a lot smarter and stronger than you, seeing as he knocked you down without even realizing it. 'It' is probably already doing the same, plotting how to kill you or stage your death. Be careful!
True. She admits to psychological issues as well which probably played a huge part in it. Anyway, hope you get the help you need OP and figure out what's going on! Best wishes.
Ok the fact that you admitted to previous psychiatric care makes this story void. Sounds like paranoid delusions and/or hallucinations. It seems extremely unlikely that someone would go to that great a length to stalk a call center manager.  Also, I feel like this is a plot from a movie...,
