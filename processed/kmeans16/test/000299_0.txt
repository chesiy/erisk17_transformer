If this counts as anything: yesterday i went inside one of the two domes that are in my town, they aren't even finished so i doubt they have anything to do with it. I took some pictures but it was dark as fuck.   http://m.imgur.com/5sEI6Vy,r67OlWI

Shite.
1. Droideka 2. You could play as a Jet Pack Trooper if I'm not mistaken and if that isnt enough you could play as Boba Fett.
Then don't play, dont comment, and dont even get on this sub. For not caring you seem awful worried, just observation and deduction.
RUST DAMMIT
Yessir.
Ahg sorry about that! Thank you, I'll remember that for next time   im doing it alone, i just broke up with my girlfriend or ex for that matter and I'm sorta just needing something to get me out of where i am.
You love this shitty country? This country that kills its innocent civilians? Im not saying i give up, im just pointing out that our 'privacy' has been in the government's hands before any of us even thought that our precious country would do such a thing. This "country" for a lack of a better word is too far gone. I care about myself and whats going to happen to me in these dark dark days, im not rolling over and dying im just pointing out the obvious.
Thank you.
Where is this.
Dude i fucking hate that, this is my opinion and you think im crazy for it. Im just trying to keep other people informed goddammit!
