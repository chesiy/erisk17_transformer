You can choose not to give your data to private companies.  you do know what subreddit you are in?  Thats actually quite fucking hard these days. If you can actually manage to protect your own data and only give the info you want to people like google and MS and the government who buys it from them.... then you will be protected from the NSA as well  sorry you have a naive view about the privacy problem. Businesses can find out who your neighbors were 20 years ago.. tell me right now, what you signed or agreed to, for them to have that info? You dont even know what info of yours is on the private market and yet you sit here and claim you have a choice. Thats laughable man.  how many cam girls do you think know they are auto recorded by bots for the private market to resell their data? Yeha they should ASSUME someone is doing that right? But THEY HAVE NO FUCKING CHOICE dude. Its CAM and be recorded and resold.. or dont fucking cam.  The private market is just as sly. you dont always have a choice on your data.  Yeah she is in public this is a public example very easy for people to understand, it gets more convoluted.   tell me right now.. no google  which phone company can i use that wont sell to the government?  which grocery stores wont sell my data to the government?  what search engines?  which cookie trackers are ok? you know sites dont tell you.. you have to look.  sorry it takes two to tango and you dont always have a clear choice.. i bet you cant tell me the cookies you collected today and what sites they were from and how that data is being used.. without being a techie. yeha i can get all kinds of cookie blockers and i can encrypt my phone calls. but its not like there are choices.
no they didnt.  A group released a paper, that isnt wildly accepted yet, that said we are due for an extreme solar min, similar to the one during the "mini ice age" which seemed to only really effect europe and didnt effect the southern hemisphere at all.  now there have been ups and downs of sun spots through out time, and they have always shown, just a very very very minor effect on climate. its real but minor. During the mini iceage there were likely many cooling effects including a quiet sun that all combined to give us the cooler temps. Much like we had a very active sun in 1998 which helped set that record... but since then, we have had a very very quiet sun.. an unusually quiet sun, and yet we are still fucking setting records.  **NOT A SINGLE SCIENTIST ON THE PROJECT EVER USED THE WORDS that a mini ice age MAY start in 15 years**  read the fucking report yourself and not the right winger telegraph interpretation of the report.   and fucking amazing how the denialists think the 'mini ice age' was real and global and the word of god and 100% caused by sun spots,  this is written in diamond.... but all other climate science is a guess and a hoax and a joke. ER.....   anyways this is horse shit, and the raw story should have known better. Not a god damn scientists made this claim. They simply said we havent seen sunspots this low(predicted to come) since the maunder minimum.. and everyone ran with 'scientist say ice age is coming'... not evne close to true.   PS the last time the earths tilt was like it is today... we were in an ice age.  OH MER GERD.  mans influences are stronger than that.. wow..   we were actually entering a cooling phase by the tilt cycle that lasted for nearly 2000 years, until... about 150 years ago.. when the industrial age happened.(and yes notice that "mini ice age" happened in that period) But notice back 370 years ago.. what wasnt happening, was man wasnt spewing all this carbon into the air.. ok we spewed a lot but  to even compare how much we spewed back then versus today we would have to have a logarithmic graph because we spew exponentially more than they did back then...   to long didnt read, there is a fucking reason why newyork is surrounding itself with sea walls and florida is surrounding its cities with huge drains and water pumps and why russia put a flag on the sea floor in the arctic and why exxon decided to not exploit a field because it would be the single biggest carbon emitter if they did and they dodnt want that advertisement.
and the females generally mate with much younger males, as the males born at the same time as her have long since died... before she even got of age to mate.   and yeah that surprised me they dont "mimic orchids", because they look mighty mighty orchid like to me, but I dont happen to be an insect.  and the whole, shes just as likely to eat you as mate with you and might anyways when your are done...makes dating an interesting affair.  yeah i dont know squat about bugs either, but every once in a while a post will make me go out and get learneded.
they look horribly cheap.  not even sure how they are supposed to hold on.  awesome close ups of the quality.   i guess you jam this on a working drip tip?  yeah they look pretty cool, but price is a bit high for a 50 cent toy with a hole in it.
unfortunately all you still have is likely conjecture.  A lot of redditors will recognize this, you see a title for an article and your brain, all on its own, invents the wittiest and funniest thing ever.. you click on comments and find it is the top post already. There is 7 billion of us, a lot of thoughts happen independently in many minds, there have even been noted scientific discoveries that happened simultaneously without the two knowing about each other.  but 'life court' tends to not need absolute scientific level proof and your evidence is strong, just remember though, with 99.9% certainty, there is still a 0.1% chance you are wrong. :)
and they blame the nicotine? I wonder because there are similar studies with cannabis smoke, and the studies have had some of the same complaints you bring up.. but also, fairly sure it doesnt have any nicotine in it.
actually they will still rise out of poverty. they arent the problem we are.  the 'dial back" is mainly due to you guys saying "just wait".. which you have been saying for decades. It would have been easier to start this in the 90s and ever decade it gets harder.  also you guys said the same thing over so2 and you were wrong then as well. It worked.. we didnt have to wait for magic.. (which by the way.. still hasnt arrived).. it didnt kill society and now statues in the parks melt less. Co2 is bigger and more costly and will be more disruptive than cap and trade of so2.. but really your side has been wrong ever time.  from cfcs, to leaded gas, to addictive cigs..to so2 and now to co2.  and really, yall have denied us into such a worse situation, not sure why anyone would listen to the right for a solution. 'yeah yeah we stopped all progress on this problem for 30 years now.. but hey listen to us for this weak ass, not going to work, just wait for some magical invention idea'
yeah i searched all over for that quote.. embiggened the text and all and then watched the video and sighed.  He was definitely in the wrong. 100% supporter of gay rights, but i like my government to be cold hard generic, and they tend not to be already but in the other direction.  They have no business promoting any point of view.  and i could see someone saying that, but i would like to hear it for myself, or see the quote, most likely if it did happen, they were just being a snarky ass. But to me it just sounded like he was belittling the complaint, when the town had a very reasonable objection... for a change.
Well, bad guys tend to be harder to catch if they dont wear that stupid burglars mask all the time.  To belabour a point, I would never fart and blame it on someone else, them people are sick, they are like the worst people in the world, who would even do that and dont listen to those other people saying i do that sort of thing, cause thats just wrong. i'm totally against that sort of thing.  Btw i think allie totally just farted right now, wasnt me, i never even had gas.
none of his previous felonies were due to violence.  if he was an american he would have been released teh same way, and she would have still be dead.  the only difference is he was here illegally and like it or not that doesnt predicate that he is a murderous asshole, as this would have happened had he been an american.  they simply wont turn them over to ice, without violence or robbery. A drug charge and being here illegally, there is no way they can predict that means he wil turn to violence. Yeah its trajectory but it isnt like they "put a previously violent illegal" back on the streets. No they put a previously caught with over 2 ounce of pot 4 times due on the streets, the other 3 were reentry which they dont recognize and would have had released he been american too.  so a judge released a man he had every reason to assume he was a non violent criminal on the streets, due to state law not turning voer non violent people in this country illegally. Tragedy yes, but this isnt quiet how some are makiing it.
well i def see a lot of the religious as super narcissistic to the point of mania. Maybe not the perfect term, but they made religion into a body mold, that fits them perfectly God dont care that much about their sins, but he sure hates everything you do.. and cares about the sins others do that you care about.  lying? eh god wasnt serious.  working on sunday? yeah that was a long time ago.  help the poor? LOLOL, i think liberals added that part.  But gays.. yeah fuck them, and Dont call me a bigot, gods the one who said that, not me.   basically we do have a lot of self worshipers.  (and just to pull back a little, it is kinda human nature to see your own shit dont stink but others do... i might cook some stinky ass food but its my neighbors walking on the ceiling thats really annoying but still point is valid, they have a religion of self.)
well part of the answer is there is no one republican party. its actually a coalition of conservative groups. There is the more economic conservatives and libertarian conservatives, who tend to yell the most to keep out of peoples lives. They are joined with the authoritarian and war like conservatives... How are more into spying and keeping the country safe and dont think people have the right to privacy and tend to like a lot of laws that put people in jail and are also joined with social conservatives, who do want government interference in social issues, like abortion and gay marriage and yoga pants and drugs and ...  there is no one republican party, so you are hearing the small gov chants of one section of the party, and the calls for  abortion laws from another section.  dems have similar coalitions, there is no one real dem party  they have to do this, rather than become multiple liberal and multiple conservative parties due to first past the post voting.
yep, heard it for years and thats about as much as you get. "he seems like it". But i would add, its more than not been married, he hasnt been known to really date either. i'm not trying to tilt the favor towards "he's gay".. but obviously if he had a different lady on his shoulder every week the "not married" wouldnt suggest gay in some peoples minds.  I couldnt care much less if he is or isnt. If he is and wants to come out, i hope he can some day. but i dont really consider him being fancy or single, means hes gay..
nope. We do get you have a hate for the man, so your view is horribly colored.  Let me hazard an easy guess, but i suspect you dont happen to be an obama supporter? that you probably agree more with the right of the aisle? is this a fair assessment? not saying you are a republican, just not left? and let me guess fdr mae the depression worse?
and they are talking about expanding the government subsidized phone service started by reagan, to include information access. So people have to tools to better themselves while working a min wage job when they cant afford to go to college.   they arent talking about net for all.. or even most of us and even then, most of the people who do get it, will only get money off their bill.  its not quite how people are putting it like everyone in the us will get free net. its expanding a telecommunications program that already exists to include data.  you can still disagree but its only for people way below the poverty line and believe it or not more and more social service are being done online and that saves us money, but the poor have to find a kinkos or somewhere to email or fax the forms.
No, it isn't. It's what Abbas admitted he would do back in 2009:  [Israel's PM Netanyahu: No Palestinian state on my watch](http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/16/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-palestinian-state/) he alo demanded right winger israelis overwelm the arab vote, which is pure bigotry. he was using fear like you right wingers always do.  derp much dude? i never said hamas was all the open arms people.. of cause you are talking about the other wing of palistine in your links.. but w/e I SAID THEY WERENT THE SOLE CAUSE.. as you pretend they are.  [Netanyahu admits on video he deceived US to destroy Oslo accord](http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/middle-east/netanyahu-admits-on-video-he-deceived-us-to-destroy-oslo-accord)  lets do an experiment in bias and bigotry and we will see who is the full of shit one.  1. many in palistines leadership have zero interest in peace.  2. hamas military wing is a terrorist org that attacks innocent people  3. the palestinians and arabs helped start this when they went to war in 1968  Now let see you at least admit, that some people in israel and in their leadership have no interest in diplomacy.. you wont explode i promise.  admit that some israelis, especially the settlers act like terrorists.  can you admit any of that? nope. Sorry dude you are ignorant of the situation. I never denied palestine's shit stunk.. i denied that israelis shit smells like roses 100% of the time.  you are attacking strawmen.
there is no obamacare.. there is exchanges for the market place to compete for people on the individual market all in one place.. and some subsidies and crap. This is republicans counting on their base not knowing wtf Obamacare is.  they are trying to say it is so distasteful to get insurance this way that teh supreme court justices would refuse or something. Yeah it would end up costing them more than the free insurance they are provided.. but its just fucking insurance. There is no special obama to it. Its the same insurance you get at work.. just at work its cheaper because it is bought in bulk. this is a way to bring the costs down on the individual market.   anyways its a bit hilarious petty to try to punish scotus for a ruling they didnt like. Can you imagine if Obama tried to punish scotus  for ruling against his recess appointments or his abortion center buffer zone? I think he would already be under impeachment.
I'm not sure if this is totally true. Well maybe from a data standpoint but darwinian evolution says giraffes where had longer necks survived because they had more access to food.. etc.. where id says god decided he wanted some long ass necked animals.  the main difference to me.. scientifically is one is semi predictable, the other isnt.  i know that on small landmasses animals tend to be smaller.. where in id, you got to guess that god wanted some cute smaller versions of certain animals and decided to place them on islands.   or the all female lizards that clone themselves.. darwinian evolution says they will most likely have problems and that its not a good evolutionary strategy to live as clones.. god guided says nah, if god wants to the lizard to survive it will.. doesnt matter its evolutionary state.
i am am not sure she can say there is no tipping point..eventually you can actually get enough where it is a chore to try to spend it.. not sure how you could say that more would make you happier when you cant spend what you have.   but yeah anyways the first study never claimed that it stopped at 75 but that that was the peak of happiness gains in changes of income. that after 75k each 10k more is less changing than under 75k
well hopefully they will learn how stupidly offensive it is and how it was never the actual flag of the confederacy and only gained real popularity after the klan and other bigot groups started to use it and then was put up all over the south during the civil rights era.  its only true history, besides being on the dukes of hazards is bigotry. well that and it was the regiment flag of virgina and tenn.. the SC flag was the palmetto confederate flag which would have been more appropriate even though i still disagree with that one.
and google does the site search.. used them instead of reddits for ages.  just do reddit.com  search query in google for a site search.. no longer need to tell google to do a site search anymore either
and they are about to get sued and lose, after spending millions to defend a losing suit.  yes both sides do it.. and i would like to see a study about how much we spend on these stupid laws that are nothing more than an expensive ass tax payers ad for the asshole who passed them. I am quite sure he was told by intelligent advisors that this law would not survive a scotus challenge but was probably also told that this would be good for him politically, both passing the law and when the law is challenged and he can scream about activists courts.  like my state is pouring money in the gay marriage fight, despite half the US lost that same fight before us.  Jindal knew he was lying through his teeth about the purpose.  Jindal also knows it is totally unconstitutional.
No. Couldn't make it to practice.  I smell a phoney.. canadians dont miss hockey.  [Flight delayed because passengers refused to board the plane during the hockey game](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/passengers-held-up-flight-to-watch-hockey-1.969664)
I think some of that anthropogenic stuff is more than damaging to science. By far most of the quantum crockery out there has to deal with that unfortunate term. "observe" when interact with is much better. And i bet most who understand the term, first heard it like everyone else, especially if they found out about it young. That the universe 'changed' simply because human eyes were looking at it.... or a gods. Like I have heard, things only happen on other planets cause god's eyes sees things and quantum theory says reality doesnt exist without eyes to see. And people with the most elementary knowledge of it all.. might at least know that unusual claims about "observation" in science and so the crock story sounds truish.  you change from observation to interacts with anything and suddenly the crocks dont have it so easy. they will still be there but science wont be helping them, just due to unfortunate terminology. (and evolution reporting is way worse, you'd think every species had yearly meetings to decide how to evolve and with a lot of thought, the giant stink plant decided to smell like bad meat to attract flies which it knew liked the smell of bad meat.. and the plant doesnt even have a sense of smell.. or a brain.. but it decided)  i know we are human and its natural to anthropomorphize and sometimes good to help people understand things, but often it can be more than misleading.
well on the 2 of mine that have it reboots do nothing.  1 that is really bad, i left off for days. it gets a bit warmer than the rest.. dont know if that could make the burn in last longer. But nope that didnt work for me. And if you look at the links in my other comments you will see that doesnt work for a lot of people.. hence the apps.  but thats for the advice, turning it off and on again.. its almost like the first rule of IT.  :P
. A 1983 Missouri law requires that women buy optional insurance for elective abortion coverage.  wow. I'd like to see if that is constitution, or an undo extra burden on womens rights. No other medical procedure do you require "extra insurance'.. basically the state is saying that a woman must expect prehand that she will have an abortion for what ever reasons. And pay extra for that 'right'   and yeha they damn well know most wont get the extra insurance, because most people who get abortions never ever expected to have to get one.   such fucking evil.
The department whose officer was charged with murder after shooting an unarmed man in the back is taking another look at a previous use-of-force case against him that was closed two years ago even though witnesses told The Associated Press that investigators never contacted them.
What was the night sky like 4 billion years ago?   Basically asking for scientific guesstimates on what the sky would have looked like.  I figure our light cone radius should be shrunk by even more than 4 billion light years due to inflation. And I figure due to actual relative movement, some have moved out of view and will come back into view as we go back 4 billion years.   I also get the milkyway was younger, I dont have much info on galactic development.. if baring mergers they quickly reach an average star level or slowly lose stars after an initial burst. And I dont know if we had a merger in that period or how many.  I'm guessing we would see a lot more stars with the naked eye. and with the galaxies closer, i guess they get bigger and brighter too. **Just how cool was the night sky 4 billion years ago.**  4-5 times as many stars? a lot brighter?
