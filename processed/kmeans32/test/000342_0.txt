Yeah I've seen a lot of that but I'd rather have buttercream. Thanks.
What icing is best for an ice cream cake that will be frozen and eaten slowly?   I made an ice cream cake (two vanilla cakes with some strawberry ice cream in between) and it is currently in my freezer setting up in a spring form pan. I want to put some icing on it and maybe practice decorating, but I don't know what will freeze well. My roommates are gone for another week but there's no way I'm waiting for them to get started on this thing. So my question is what icing will hold up to being taken in and out of the freezer while I slowly devour this cake over the course of the next week or two? Will buttercream be okay? Thank you.
Wish I could add an extra upvote for rowing. Have a good trip!
A couple of people I know really like them, but I'm not a big fan. The first few times I sculled with them was in bad weather, and it really irritated my wrists and forearms. I had tendonitis in my wrists a couple of years ago, and it felt like the extra effort it took to square and feather started to bring that back, especially in the choppy water. I try to avoid them just to keep my wrists happy but better and more experienced scullers than me really like them.
Sounds good. I will check those channels out. Thank you!
Okay. I was just hoping for a number of lbs to add at a time or a way to figure out how much is too much. I'll start with adding 5 and see how I feel from there. Thanks.
Oh! I had no idea! That's exactly the answer I was looking for. Thank you for your contribution.
Beginner - how slowly should I add weight?
Any way to increase my body awareness?   I'm 20yo female who didn't really do any sports until I got to college (I did some swimming in middle school and marching band in high school, but nothing else). I started rowing in college three years ago and now I'm really dedicated and committed to that. But I've noticed on and off the water that I have less body awareness than my teammates. For example, when doing weights I can't tell if my spine is neutral or bent without a mirror or a partner. Are there any exercises--either physical or mental--that I can do to help increase my body awareness? This subreddit seemed like a good place to go but feel free to direct me somewhere else.
Wooooow
That's alarming
I agree with this. Do not take laxatives. Just watch what you eat. Maybe do some extra running or steady state if you have time.
My coaches always say the sleep you get the night before a 2k is just as important as the sleep you get two nights before a 2k, so try to get a good amount of sleep both nights before your test. Good luck!
What show should I show my nonmusician and athletic roommate to best demonstrate the badassery of DCI? Link to it if you can.   Thank you very much!
How is the sizing compared to JL?
Oh also I realized that I go on some pretty terrible sugar binges if I completely cut it out of my diet. So have some chocolate chips or a cookie every couple of days or something so you don't lose your mind. It helps with the binge eating and with general mood improvement.
I attempted at baumkuchen and it was worth every layer.
Mmmmm challah
Turkey, caramelized onions and garlic, mozzarella, parmesan, tomatoes, on a homemade baguette fresh out of the oven.
I am jealous of every single thing
Thank you!

Also try not to just row one side.
Back and Forth (A Song About Erging)
So far we've done two 30' tests and I did worse on the second one, which is why this whole debate started. Since then I've been training with higher splits to keep my heart rate in the right zone (until the end of a piece every now and then). We have our next test tomorrow, so hopefully this will all pay off and I'll be okay.  And I don't feel like I'm killing myself at 170+ but I also don't feel like I know enough about hr zones to say that I'm okay there, because it is tiring but not that tiring. I've only been rowing for 2+ years and I've only been paying attention to my hr for the past six months. I will definitely discuss more with my coaches. Thank you so much!
Naturally high heart rate? Is that a thing?   Does anyone have any articles or information on heart rates that run a little on the high side? I've done some googleing but it's always helpful to see what others have found.
Decided I want to step it up and work towards trying out for US U23 in a year or two. Bring on the steady state.
I don't know what your normal workouts are like but basically yes. And then throw in some extra steady state. So maybe those two workouts and then two days of SS and then weights and whatever other stuff you do, but toned down a bit because you're erging so much. Also these workouts will give you an idea of what to shoot for. Make sure you're negative splitting; it's better for your erg times and your body.   Also the hardest part about erging is the mentality, so that's probably what you need to work on the most. Even though you know the mental erg struggle, it's been awhile and a 2k is hell. So remember that, and keep your focus while you're erging, especially through the long pieces and the last couple sprint pieces.
YES get one! There are sales all the time, online and in stores, just keep your eyes peeled. Black Friday and Xmas are coming, so if you really want to get one cheap, wait until then. Also try to get one of the better brands so that your hrm doesn't pick up the signals of others around you.
Just try to match handle heights. Do pause drills at different places in the stroke.
Try focusing on dropping it in quickly and then applying pressure right at the catch. Are you using your arms too much? Focus on driving with the legs and hips.
Why are sweep boats mostly port stroke?   Is there an actual sciencey reason or is it just tradition?
