So you actually were so mad at me that you went to my profile to find something to use against me, and I'm the weirdo. I shouldn't have to defend myself but since you've tried to use something against me, r/all amuses the shit out of me and I end up in some really strange places. If you had the time to comb through which subs I've commented in, you also read my comments. Which were A. Calling someone an asshole, and B, being a woman and agreeing with a man. SOOOO weird. Totally worthy of a personal attack.
You should read the sidebar.
With the pain in your windpipe and the standing on the stool and the photo of the beam, I'd say someone was hanged in that pub and you yourself are in danger of the same. I'd have a look at the local records, maybe ask a few of the older folk if they know of any anecdotes about the place, and I'd likely find someone to stay with you or find somewhere else to stay until your parents return. Good luck OP and keep us updated. Edit: As well, in the jumbled up conversation with Sarah, "En mi camino" means "on my way." Not sure if that has any significance to you. Second edit: una luz en mi camino, means "a light on my path."

In real life I'm actually a super kind and understanding person. What irks me is that all of a sudden society has to cowtow to weakness. I've seen trigger warnings in college syllabi. I think that's absolutely ludicrous. Real life doesn't come with trigger warnings. There's not gonna be someone to warn you if you're about to walk out the door to see an assault and no one is going to cover your eyes when you see bad things happening. I think that instead of letting the fear and "triggers" win, people who can't handle it should get the help they need from a professional and learn coping skills.
It's true. I wasn't saying they were the same thing, necessarily, just that there were similarities it might have helped OP to read. On how to deal with it, etc.
Them!
Yes!
It's funny you mention that. Where I grew up it's very conservative and exactly as you said, less colorful. Even the lesbians fit into gender roles, you know? Femme and butch. Unfortunately there's really nothing in the world that makes me melt like a good strong butch and they just don't exist here.
What is ftfy?
100% not how things work here. In case you're new, here's the rules from the sidebar.   Comment Rules: Readers are to act as though everything is true and treat it as such in the comments. No debunking, disbelief, or criticism (constructive or otherwise). Do not ask for proof. Be respectful to one another. Comments must contribute to the discussion. Report all comments that violate these rules.
I seriously would not let her out of my sight. Nothing has ever happened to my girl but in the city I live in, bad things happen to small dogs A LOT. She goes out on a leash AND we have a fence with a gate that makes a ton of noise. Call me paranoid if you want. Do you have any enemies you can think of, OP? Do your parents?
Why is there not more?!?!?!? My cousin sent me the link and I read the whole thing in 2 hours. PLEASE tell us what has gone on since!
It comes from eating human flesh in general. It's a prion processing disorder. You can also have similar symptoms from eating only one meat for an extended period. Things build up in your system over time. Colloquial knowledge tends to mix up Kuru and CreutzfeldtJakob disease. That could be where the misunderstanding came from.
Did you get your shirt back? :(
Update please.
Dude. My suggestion is wrap yourself in garbage bags and duct tape and burn that mofo! Ps. Sorry about Vern. :(
Are you dead? Did you die in childbirth?
SO what is it then, that makes it so you can't feel pain in your dreams? And how are you getting the wee cuts? I feel like I've missed something and that bothers me 'cause I'm covered in the damn things all the time. I just chalk it up to sharing a bed with a grouchy black cat and a 30lb border collie with no concept of personal space. But it still bothers me.
"Chortle" made me chortle.
Any news OP?
I got so excited I teared up.
Porkchop I need to know more!!!!!
More please! I wanna know!
I actually agree with you 100%. My son is 7 and even for being really smart and witty, the kid just can not lie to me. He has said things a few times that I've had a hard time believing but he's almost always right about whatever it was.   OP, I believe your daughter. Don't push about the mug. Ask her if her friends took the pictures, how she met them, when she sees them, etc. Maybe also don't leave the younger daughter alone with her for a little while, just in case. Not because she'll hurt her but because the friends might.
I suggest if you have a message you'd like passed on to family or friends, you post it as a comment here and then shut down the account before she can.
Shit. Okay. Eventually she's going to threaten you if you don't keep typing. She won't speak to you she'll just be reading over your shoulder. Warren called her Mel but I guess maybe he misheard her. Either way you need to get the hell out of there now.
wat?
I'm sad this was removed!  But on a better note, I won this game this morning! Had a hair elastic in my hand while sitting in bed, don't remember setting it down, found it underneath my pillow!   Edit: Did you change the clock on my stove? I reset it after a power outage and the next day it was 11 minutes off. Second edit: 3:49 am. Have lost my cellphone 3 times now, twice found in bed, once in bathroom. Bunch of Chrome tabs I don't remember opening. I promise to never notice you again.
This is seriously my favorite thing on the internet.
