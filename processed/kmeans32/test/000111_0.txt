How do you guys know when a camera is right for you?   When I was in grad school, I had no money and my brother gifted me a D40. I loved that thing and took thousands of pictures over 5 years.  Now I'm a little better off financially and am looking for a camera...I thought having more options would lead to a much better choice, but I've now bought and returned/resold the following cameras (and corresponding lenses at times):  EPL3 - NEX6 - D5300 - D7000  I haven't felt the same magic or freedom I felt with the D40. In fact, I'm beginning to feel like I'm setting myself up for disappointment in always looking for a better camera, but on the other hand, every camera feels like I'm settling.  Do any of you feel the same about your gear? Any advice?  EDIT: Thanks for all your responses, guys. Getting out there and shooting is the important part. I get that, but I really have to train myself not to think of the gear. It was easy when I couldn't afford better when it was forced upon me that I couldn't have better gear. Photography really is an emotional thing for me, and I really want it to stay that way :)
Camping in CA...Cold is okay, but not too cold...any suggestions?   Exactly what it says in the title. I'm looking to go camping in CA Jan 2-5. Cold is fine, but freezing and below temperatures aren't good, since I just want to stay in relative comfort.   Strenuous hikes are very welcome, though! My last trip to CA was Mt. Whitney in August. That much cold is okay, but no more!  As you can see, fighting the cold is my No. 1 criteria :)   Any suggestions?
Yup, count me in!
Thanks! Changed it according to your feedback. I think the Good At section is bland, because whatever I'm good at, answering that question isn't on that list.
Dude, from the looks of your FR, it looks like she was the one that seduced you...which is not a bad thing at all, of course... means you're worth it :)  But I think you're fooling yourself if you're thinking you made this happen with your cool seduction skills ;-)
Me, I prefer to fuck brave people. Not just here. Anywhere.
I do have questions!  1/ It does look like I won't be able to train this year, so I might have to postpone climbing to next year. I'm getting to Washington by August. What training do you suggest? Where? I dont really want guided tours. I would rather take the time to learn myself and go once I'm ready.  2/ How have you been preparing for this? Do you have experience with glacial climbing?  3/ Nothing here...Thanks for your help! If you're in Seattle and we meet, beer is on me!
Me too. And I did it after I read your comment. Umm... just to make sure you were actually that dumb.  I was right. Ha!
I don't think the balance is fine at all. I'm heavily on your side in this argument. Googling is okay, I guess, only as long as you make sure you're understanding what's going on enough to not make the same mistake.   And that understanding is kind of enforced if you don't have Google...   Well... The line is kind of fine :-)
I just took that interview last month and got an offer...Will be glad to answer questions...though I can't deal with specifics of the questions since I signed an NDA.  It's an all-day coding project and you work with what seems to be a simplified version of a real-world problem. You can (and should!) ask questions of your teammates and the employees in the room with you. You can ask Google (I mean, the internet..you'll have access to internet) for help if you want... but basically don't hesitate to ask anyone questions.  The problem really tests your basic coding skills -- whether you can drill a problem down to what it requires, design a data structure for the problem and then use it well to solve it. The one-on-one is very relaxed as well and has to do with the problem itself and make sure you ask him all the questions you have about the work and work culture at Amazon at that interview!  It's a lot of fun and much less stressful than the process at other companies...Good luck!   And ask away if you have questions...
Okay I can't really decide if it's 21 (10.5 x 2) or 10x2... My brain can't keep up with the song...Any drummers here care to chip in?  EDIT: http://www.jazz.com/music/2008/2/5/mahavishnu-orchestra-celestial-terrestrial-commuters  It says it's 9/8 :(
Thanks a lot for your help. That looks much better! :)
Good!  I mean...well you know what I mean :)
You can check the EXIF data for the auto-mode shot to get a good starting point :)  HDR would be the only way to do what you ask, I think. Though in this case, I like that the dark foggy areas are dark and foggy.  Really cool picture. I get a very good sense of depth because of the alternate layers of fog and skyline..
The air flowing over a wing needs to be at least somewhat "straight." With air flowing over and under the wing in the pattern a propeller causes (more-or-less a vortex), you wind up getting a substantial reduction in lift. Sure, there's high speed air over the top of the wing. But it's also over the bottom. In fact, turbofan aircraft may have a lift advantage over prop planes precisely because the air around the engines is going to be less perturbed than the air around a prop.  No no. Air perturbation has nothing (well very little) to do with lift. Turbulent drag is LESS than laminar drag. Channel wing aircraft did produce greater lift than regular aircraft! There were other problems with the aircraft, including construction difficulties, structural problems, slow climb and higher form drag.  Propellers DO increase lift over the wing. There are toy aircraft that wouldn't even fly if this wasn't true. The Bernoulli's explanation for lift in the first place is wrong. You say "more-or-less a vortex". Without a "vortex", there wouldn't be lift at all. The flow behind a propeller is not at all a vortex. It has a vortex structure similar the flow behind a wing, kind of twisted to form of a helix.
Starting Strength OHP and Power Clean alternatives   Hello all,  I'm starting the SS program, and because of a complete lack of interest from all my friends, I've been doing it on my own.   The problem is that OHP and Power Clean look like very umm..."dangerous" exercises, i.e., wrong form can injure you seriously (more so than squats, deadlifts and bench presses), so I'm too apprehensive to try them alone.  In fact, I even got advice from a random cool dude in the gym about my wrong squat form, which made me even more apprehensive to try the Power Clean and the OHP...  Are there alternatives which would give similar results?   (Ir?)relevant info: I'm a runner (5k in 17 m 30' to give an idea of pace), 180 cm, 74 kg (163 lb) and want to get strong, but not bulky (well...no interest in bulk, to be precise)
Oh yes yes maybe. I have the ATT version and the T-mobile one has more than mine for sure.  But it doesn't _really_ matter. There are always devs porting ROMs all around the place.  EDIT: Not sure where you can check this. But galaxys2root.com is a good place for the S2. If you just poke around XDA long enough, you'll suddenly find one day that you have an opinion!
Post-processing   I started taking pictures a few years back and didn't do any processing. More so because I was lazy to learn than anything else.  My photostream is here: http://www.flickr.com/photos/pritamps (Just lost pro status, sorry!). None of the photos on there are processed. I used to be proud of that for some reason.   Now, I'm ready. I have Lightroom installed and want to learn the basics (color adjustments, tonal curves etc.)  Are there some good tutorials about this? Books or something along the lines that give me an idea of what good processing is would be good as well!  I did check out r/Lightroom, but it's not active at all..  EDIT: Thanks a lot for all your suggestions! Lynda.com it is!! :)
This kind of gets into the dirty details of things, but OPs explanation was only conceptual. The ONLY real interaction (that causes any sort of net transfer of energy) between the wings and the air is through friction, i.e. viscosity. No viscosity, no lift.   The idea is Viscosity - Circulation - Lift.   There is a net loss in momentum of the air and a net force on the wing (both lift and drag), i.e. Newton's Law. Yes, the air is deflected downwards in order to generate lift,  If you integrate the pressure over the entire surface of the wing, you get a net force, which can be split into lift and drag.  Also, "Air hitting the bottom surface" of the wing is just wrong. Imagine a flat plate with flow perpendicular to it. Air is hitting the bottom surface in all glory, but lift is infact zero (all the force is drag).  Aerodynamics researcher (PhD) and teacher of Senior Level Applied Aerodynamics.
Wow... this is awesome. Here's what I said on another poem right here on this subreddit, today:  "I think your content is good, but you seem to be in the same boat as me. We need to edit much, much more. I'm having to be frank with you, but you (and I, that's why I'm saying this) aren't "natural" poets -- the kind that write a masterpiece in one sitting. We have poetic thoughts, then we put them down. But without refinement, we are just stones on a beach."   Thanks!!!
Shouldn't have brought God into the mix, sorry. I'm not worried about God at all...I just like thinking about these things.  Of course circularity is useless. When you have a circular proof with no way around it, it means you have an assumption you cannot prove. And that was what I was asking -- whether the Scientific method is such an assumption. It seems it is, for now at least.   Which is not a bad thing at all. We have to start consistent thought somewhere :)
Hang in there. I can't help you with much really, but I can tell you this after being through a lot education:  Take the courses you like! Work hard! Learn stuff! IT DOES NOT MATTER if you're unintelligent and you fail. IT DOES NOT MATTER if you're super intelligent and you get an A.  I mean, it does matter for a while, but believe me. I've failed and gotten As on courses and in a few years, all that will matter is that you took the courses you liked and tried to learn.   Keep learning, keep studying. Keep working. Keep trying.   You'll cry on some nights. Maybe many nights. Get through them and when you're reasonably okay again, focus on what you want and keep trying to do it.
Where is this place?
Yeah...exactly.  The last few years have taken away a lot from me. I'm prepared to spend many years getting it all back, even if I have to do it one step at a time.  Whenever you feel like you can't go on, just let a few days go by. The weather will change or a grocery store girl will smile at you...I never can tell when it begins and when it ends. When it ends, I exercise...   Very glad to be of help...
Thank you   I am new to this subreddit, but only because I didn't know it existed.  Reading through it gives me so much hope.   To the people who post their problems here:  I am truly inspired today by your courage to lay your heart out on reddit and take advice. This gives me hope about me, and tells me that no matter what I'm feeling, there are always people who will care.  Thank you.
I tried again and again for 4 years before finally giving up on trying to be confident. After 8 months of soul-wrenching self-reflection and a reasonable amount of hurting myself, I decided the following:  I'll make a small change, and stick to it. I won't worry about any other problem. I can't work? It's okay. I can't sleep? It's okay. I am disappointing people who think the world of me? It's okay. The world sucks and the girl I love is fucking someone else? It's okay. I just turn the other cheek and let the world slap me there. I am a loser and by definition, losers don't win. That's okay too.  As long as I can exercise regularly, everything else doesn't matter. The hope is that once I'm able to exercise regularly, I can take the next step. And some days, I can't get out of my bed. That's fine too. I'll just let those days go by and wait for the day I get out and go to gym.  The point is the hope, of course. Exercise gives me endorphins and for all I know, the endorphins might be what's letting me live.  I post to r/Fitness and get encouragement from there. I see stories on reddit and I laugh.   I'm not sure what I'm trying to say to you any more. But I went through all that you did. Maybe not or maybe my situation was worse, we can never be sure. But remember it does not matter that others think of you as a failure.   I am afraid sometimes that my family will see me for what I am and their hopes will come crashing down. But these days, I have learned to accept that too. I am what I am. This acceptance sometimes make me smile and sometimes it makes me punch walls.   But whatever I am, I will exercise regularly and then sleep well, and then dress well. And then we'll see. Fuck everything else.  I'm not sure I'm getting my point across at all, but I hope your understanding is better than my expression.
i know this is probably not the answer you're looking for, but it did work for me: Try to enjoy cooking. Look at it as part of your fitness routine. It is also a lot of fun and very interesting to try out various things.  Start with simple things and keep expanding. I used to cook once a week, and now I cook almost daily and keep trying new things. Of course, I don't make anything that takes longer than 20-30 minutes, but there's a whole world of cooking hidden in that time frame too.
Came to say this. But then saw it said and realized I don't really like the joke. Sorry HighSorcerer!  The written word truly is different.
Thanks!
Yes..That was the intent. It was an unexpected moment and I found myself thinking about it days after it happened!
Oh the caste system exists and is alive and well. People marry in the same caste. People kill for caste. People look away for caste. People get reservations for caste. People get votes for caste. Like you say, the exceptions (us, probably?) don't make the rules  And there are brahmins who eat meat religiously too (fish eaters in the coastal regions), though I agree, they are a minority. I'm a brahmin and I'm vegetarian :)   Ninja EDIT : I mean, I WAS vegetarian :P
Hands   On the sand  By Michigan Lake  And in the forest  By the sand  I thought  Of holding your hand  And walking with you  Instead of beside   After I moved a log  To make way for the queen  I buried my hands  In my sweatshirt  And played with  The lighter    Yes, the same lighter  That refused  To light our cigarettes  And robbed me of that moment  Where I would be sitting with you  Smoking by the lake  Listening to the clamour of the waves     In the curiously romantic  Silence of winter brown trees  I burned your  Stuffed monkeys tail  And felt the  Pleasant distraction  Of the heat on my palm.    You stopped  In your tracks  To look for the wolf    I looked at you  And lit the flame  on my palm again  ---  This is my first poem post here...please criticize freely!
