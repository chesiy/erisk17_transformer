I would totally be okay with 3 Tomb Raider universes:   - Hollywood Survival Action TR Reboot/Rise of  - Isometric Puzzle Platformer Co-Op Gaurdian of Light series  - Tomb Raider: Shadow of The Colossus edition  They are all pretty special, it would seem :)
Yep he's really measured and not overly cynical. This was a beautiful video.
They weren't to know, but there is a lesson here about trying our best to be a happier and more upbeat gaming community. I know I've said some pretty demanding/angry things about Nintendo in the past - this was wrong to do and I've since been more positive and flexible to change/ideas.  I really enjoyed their latest conference, there was always a sense of fun and not taking things too seriously when it came to Nintendo pressers/directs, so maybe we as a community should strive to meet that standard.   Have fun, enjoy the games we love.  Peace and Love, RIP Mr. Iwata, you did an amazing job :) 3
Fantastic Interview, he's so genuine, love his work.
I'm more worried that the message, what Metal Gear says about war (i.e. criticizing it), will be ignored in any future non-Kojima MGS titles, turning it into a gung-ho military propaganda piece :/ .   Then again, I could be worrying pre-emptively, I'm sure there are other staff that "get" the series' core ideas
I see what you are saying but I believe the head dude making it is Iranian (lives in America?) I could be wrong, also those are some of the few movies with eastern people doesnt mean the portrayal will be the same because of the same actors.  I've been playing MGS recently and Venom Snake and Jack Bauer are two completely different characters being played by the same actor, as an example :)
Awesome
People will use words like "scam" to justify their own torrents of disdain, though. Feeling righteous is the path to actually doing a lot of damage, sadly. His audience could easily take this way too far based off the "feeling" of the review alone.  I also don't agree with the idea that small games shouldn't be criticized, because people have feeling.I also don't agree with the idea that small games shouldn't be criticized, because people have feeling.  Criticism comes in many different forms, and some are more appropriate than others, especially with context. You can say very similar messages in different ways. Obviously no one is saying they can't be criticized, but what about constructive criticism? Why does there have to be a tone of outrage to the review, what does that do to improve the lives of consumers and creators?
Haha, yeah fair call. Snake has a "naked" getup ever since MGS3 I believe, so maybe, here's hoping she's got some different getups like proper camo etc.
Noah. Underrated and amazing film.
Its the internet I spose theres always going to be some people complaining about something
I thought he was great in GZ to offer a counter opinion.
Yeah, I heard that there is a ton of tapes, Videogamer did a great preview of the game on their youtube channel I highly recommend.
Yes and no.  Yes single skills for gameplay but have so many gameplay elements that upgrading those skills in different combinations and ratios makes it fun.  E.g.  I want to have a stealth assasin so I will put points into combat, stealth, and athletics  I want a stealth ghost so I swap combat for magic, so i can cast invisibility.  I want a wise talking theif? I choose stealth, dialogue and athletics.  Imagine the points directly correlating to how much X Y Z gameplay elements you wabt to engage with.  Instead of having dialogue split up amongst skills reverse it so the skills are split into specific mechanics.
Haha, wow, thanks I think!  :)

He's super right about the unhelpful behavior on people's part. Gopher seems like a very cordial and kind hearted individual and I agree with him that the negative rage/abuse/bullying etc. is not helping the point of view against the current system. I feel sorry for the mod authors, simply taking an opportunity presented to them, it's not being a horrible person to want money for your creations.  We just need to be empathetic towards each other as human beings, ya know?  3  Peace

I have two games in the works currently, the trailer for the first is a free one here (i took a break for a long while so ignore the release date lol)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0rQxQik-zk  The one I'm writing atm on the side is a graphic choose your own adventure type thing. ^_^  How about you?
This looks cool!
Wow love a new sci fi setting :)
it still fits, the squash banana is simba
The only thing I would want extra from this game is the ability to make my own character. Making a woman would be cool, for instance, but hey it looks rad anyway so yeh good luck to em. Can't wait to buy it :)
I've been to the U.S. and it really is full of lovely people. I think the american political system is horseshit and your social structure is unfair, but god damn, everyone I met over there was so friendly and kind.
Corgi's are amazing!
Fear.
Enslaved?
Morrowind is pretty great for that candy shop feeling.
https://www.youtube.com/user/PrescriptionPixel is a really cool indie game channel, I would love to know about more like this.  and  https://www.youtube.com/user/SonsOfVidya/ is two down to earth guys whose banter I find really funny and not forced.
