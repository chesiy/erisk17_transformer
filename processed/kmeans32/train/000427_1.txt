Life.
Edited.
It can work. I still have a bunch of piercings in my face and now I have tattoos. I dress a little more punk rock now. Wear what you like, it doesn't matter. One of my favorite articles of clothing is a knit body suit.
Ha. Yeah.
That's the sort of shit I do all the time. No fucks.

Wow.
That's awesome. Happy for you. I am actually lucky enough to have a few close people that are pretty understanding.
I am extremely flexible and worked as a contortionist for a while which I loved. All growing up I did dance and gymnastics and was really good at the bendy stuff.        Yeah well it turns out my body is like that because I have a genetic collagen/connective tissue disorder. In the past year it has also caused me to be in crippling pain all the time. I'm 23 and can hardly get to the grocery store. Some days I can't even dress myself. Osteoarthritis is already starting to take my hands. Not sure how Iong I can manage to stay out of a wheelchair.          At least I'm special?
Patient here. Being lucky enough to have good insurance my main problems with the medical system is the doctors and how it has been corrupted by the war on drugs.        I know there are great doctors out there, but I never seem to get them because I have seen at least ten just this year and none of them will take me seriously. The unwillingness to learn something new or how to treat me is heartbreaking every time. I know a lot of medical terms, I'm fairly articulate, and I end up crying every time I explain what's going on. I had a rheumatologist spend maybe three minutes in the room with me and then refuse to do anything about my current systems.          Sorry to be whining at you here. I guess I just hope you might have some insight. I am positive about several conditions I have but can't seem to be taken seriously. It has been destroying my life for the past ten months. I am 23 and can hardly get out of bed due to how severe my musculoskeletal pain is and I can't understand why it is so hard to find a doctor that cares.
Just because I don't understand people like that doesn't me I don't think others can't think that way about my life. All I did was answer the question. And that is my real answer.         For the record, I rarely buy clothes that aren't cheap and second hand, I don't have a car, I refuse to pay money to go to the theater, and I drink tap water.        Every time I shower I am grateful that I have access to a house with running water. I can even drink it, that's amazing. I get to eat food in all kinds of variety, the amount of vegetables I have access to is incredible and it is all because I am lucky enough to live in a first world country.       When I have the chance to give to charity or provide someone in need with a meal I do. I have distant family in the Philippines that have to walk five miles each way to get their daily supply of water.        No shit there are people that would be baffled by how I live and I do what I can to respect that.
I am specifically talking about people like that though. I didn't get too specific in the main comment because I didn't think it mattered and I didn't expect anyone to pick it apart. I just answered the question.
I played wash tub bass with a friends band for a while. When I first picked it up that's how I was making a living but it only lasted a few months.        After a year rolls around one of the well paying gigs wanted us back again for their annual party. I had to dig my wash tub out of the back of the closet and somehow when we played the gig I still remembered all the songs.        They gave us food and booze and money. It was a good day.
But the rest of us don't want anything to do with stereotypes. And considering I have been to many places with a heavy concentration of dreaded people and things like kombucha and metaphysical supplies, I doubt the one place you have been to is some kind of exception. Which gives me more reason to believe that you are close minded than that your stereotypes are a real thing.
Basic juggling.
I'm not *too* radical. It's fine if it's not your thing. But before I lost my health I worked at a dog rescue that currently has about 500 dogs, not to mention the hundreds more they have been placed in homes. If it weren't for crazy dog people like me there would be millions of innocent and loving dogs with no homes and the amount of strays would be an even more substantial problem than it already is.        If someone doesn't like me because of something like that I will gladly not have them in my life. Which has always worked out because it gives me more time to be with dogs as well as people who love the same way I do.
I accidentally tripped my cousin while she was super pregnant. She caught herself so it was fine. But yeah.       Also my  best friend and I had discovered masturbating with the shower head at about  10 or 11. We would shower together and take turns. We knew it was sexual but didn't really understand nor did we put much thought to it. We just knew it was awesome. The dialog that went on though. Oh jeez. "Hurry up its my turn!"... "Hold on I haven't twitched yet!"        We were weird children.
"What do you mean you're sick?"  Particularly when it is followed by "It can't be that bad, wait until you're older!".  For some reason a lot of people refuse to believe that a young person can be disabled.         And then there's the constant "Have you tried yoga/acupuncture/exercise/tumuric/ground up turtle shells with baby butterfly tears?" Oh I never thought of trying to find ways to feel better! I have been having so much fun being in constant pain and mourning the life I wanted to have! I don't know what I would have done had you not reminded me that yoga exists! Thanks so much!
I am seriously in the exact same position as you. I have the diagnoses of TMJ, arthritis, fibromyalga, hyperothyroid, hypermobility, and blah blah. But trying to get them to give a shit about the EDS, dysautonomia, and POTS is a pain in the ass. Not to mention the possibility of mast cell and to check for chiari.
Ah ha!
Ha. Yeah I just thought I would point that out.
Yeah that sounds like a whole different flavor of crazy. Haha.
I was just talking to my best friend about the first person to accidentally make booze and then proceed to drink it. You would think as soon as you tasted it your immediate reaction would be that it must be bad for you. General rule of thumb is that if it makes your tongue numb or burns going down it will probably kill you.     Then she pointed out that it was probably drunk out of anger; *Shit I stored my wheat outside a while ago and I just remembered it rained a few weeks ago. Fuck. Tits. Oh great look now its all ruined. Look at that its gone completely bad and its all watery. Fuck it. Fuck this. I'm eating it anyway.*      And then they are all drunk and the world is a better place for a few hours.
To not have chronic pain. I am 23 and have had it my whole life. Now it is worse and I know it will never go away. I have tried everything with no avail. It even caused me to leave my job that I loved. I basically cant function or have a life. Telling my friends I couldn't hang out on my birthday sucked.      In theory I will eventually find doctors that will not only listen to me but actually be interested in treating me. All I can hope for is enough treatment that make me well enough to be able to take a shower and go to the grocery store in the same day.      I am at the point where if I were diagnosed with some aggressive form of cancer I would be relieved. At least they would have to treat me.         EDIT: It's nice to hear from the rest of you chronic pain homies out there. We are a large but quiet breed. If you haven't visited /r/chronicpain I highly recommend it. I have gotten a lot of comfort through that sub.       Also I have  a connective tissue disorder so it won't be getting better.
Yep. When I am in pain I don't even care what it is as long as it is an opiate or similar to one. Tramadol is great, I like that it doesn't get me high. Even Tylenol 3  is fine, it's the only one that makes me sleep but generally if I get it I am pretty desperate.
It's fine.      And yeah I'm basically ready to take something even if it does have its downsides. The pain I have every day would be fine if it just lasted a week. I have a really high pain tolerance and if I had to withdraw from a drug I could deal with two weeks of horror. My pain is a consistent 6-7 pretty all the time which really isn't that bad. Except for the all the time part. I just want to be a normal person and do people things. I'm 23 and feel like I'm 63+ health problems. It's not okay anymore.
Same. It seems all the ladies on here that don't shave are saying its because of the discomfort. Which for me is a factor. But the main reason I don't shave my pits is because I think it is sexy and womanly. My armpit hair looks pretty good to me, I also like to bleach it because I hear blondes have more fun but I'm not that committed. I also just don't understand why I am supposed to shave them. Its such an odd social standard that that women aren't supposed to have body hair. How is it more feminine? Can someone explain this to me with a real answer? I may have to make an askreddit post. Which I'm sure will go over badly.
I don't think that makes a difference.
Yeah I can see how freaky it would be so much later. And thanks. I am still trying to deal with it because it was just a few months ago. It would be easier if I wasn't away from my boyfriend but I will be fine. Every period I have freaks me out less than the one before. Heh.
Thanks.
The piercing look?
[23F] Not insecure, just curious.   And bored. It's crazy how many girls on here are gorgeous but they are saying how self conscious they are when they are all way prettier than I am. Not that I think I am bad looking. I am pretty confident in my appearance especially when I have makeup on. I just don't look like all the other pretty girls here.      I live an "alternative" life and have unconventional looks (physically and with how I choose to dress). So I'm not really concerned about looking like a fashion model. But I suppose I am curious as to what people think.      Thanks!        http://imgur.com/a/pzxRJ
