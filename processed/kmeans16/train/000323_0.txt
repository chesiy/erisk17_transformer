red sauce (on the beef) : i made caramel and deglazed it with vinegar and worcestersauce added some ketchup and let it cook briefly and season with green pepper.   the white sauce (for the salad) : just mix mayonaise,  	rough-textured mustard, salt, vinegar, white pepper.
yeah but hey i made the bun !
celsius?! or this strange measurement unit based on a very cold winter in england ? ;)
It was more or less improvised. But not that complicated at all: cook the sushi rice (add some sugar, rice vinegar, salt) and let it chill. Meanwhile cut all the other ingredients in little cubes and add a egg yolk. Then add the rice, form little balls (if you like put in the middle of some of them a little piece of feta cheese) and roll them in  a mix of flour, starch and sesame und deepfry them until they have a nice colour.
I call these 'Los bollos locos"
