The Holistic Father?
Thank you. I will place this book on my reading list.  The mass of any society might prefer stasis, if it were comfortable enough. Those of conservative temperament, in the cultural sense, should be its natural advocate -- their 'good old days' would be more permanent. Likewise, this would tend to perpetuate existing, hereditary elites. That is the downside. In contrast, Capitalism has always been to the disproportionate benefit of a would-be elite, one that is always willing to sell-out tradition and their fellows for advancement. These go-getting 'disruptors' view themselves as agents of 'progress', in multifarious forms, but ultimately, they can only accelerate an increase in global entropy.
Thank you. I was not confident in my source.
A Collapsing Ecosystem Revealed in Owl Vomit
The best formulation of Fascism is as neither Left or Right. The concept of a political party organized on military lines followed the Bolshevik model. As with the Communists, extreme violence was its ultimate political method, but the Fascists tolerated capitalists (and aristocrats) to the extent they were useful to their nationalist aims. The Nazis created an impressive welfare state to win the loyalty of the population, with class conflict rejected in favor of racial theory -- this became the basis for both social equality and exclusion. While National Socialism was in many ways unique, it is important to remember that its goals were not dissimilar from some of its capitalist, liberal contemporaries -- what Belgium did in the Congo, Nazis sought to accomplish in Eastern Europe,
A clear illustration of how devastating even a low-tech, lower intensity-density civilization can devastate an ecosystem, and this rapid exhaustion of US forests for construction materials and fuel would spur the transition to iron and coal. Also pertinent to this discussion is the impact of Pre-Columbian civilizations on the forest cover of the Western hemisphere -- a popular account is the book 1491, by Charles C. Man. Two centuries before the migration of William Penn, that landscape is now thought to have been much less sylvan. Though the Amerindians were more thoughtful stewards of the land, from both by necessity and from belief, their impact on total biomass had to be considerable. We have the cautionary example of the Maya civilization and its collapse, but how sustainable were the woodland cultures of eastern North America?
I saw the film first, and this detracted nothing from my reading of the novel. Burgess offers a darkly comic satire that questions the basis of human morality and how society responds to deviance. Kubrick (as usual) makes a masterful adaptation and despite the passage of forty-odd years, the cinematography, the costumes and sets still evoke a 'future' to me. As to the original ending to the novel, the missing twenty-first chapter, that was deleted from the American edition. I have not read this ending, but from description, I think it would undercut the central point of the story, and would certainly diminish its delightfully cynical conclusion. Its removal, by the American publisher and then by Kubrick, shows the value added by a good editor.

While climate science is making rapid advances, how quickly and to what extent this amplified greenhouse effect will perturb the ocean currents will remain uncertain  for any analysis, these represent a most complex heat engine. In my original comment, I did not intend to suggest a Canfield Ocean (and its Green Sky) is an imminent event, only that the paleontological record does suggest this as a mechanism for previous mass extinctions, and that experts in the field do find an ominous parallel in our ongoing alteration of this planets atmosphere. I am certain that most of the followers of Collapse would agree this is the ultimate monstrous crow; the basic chemistry and physics of the process are, frankly, undeniable, and I believe we can now hear the flap of its wings.  However, this distant, future event should not concern Disingenuous. There is no danger of NBA cancelling the current Finals for a Green Sky.
