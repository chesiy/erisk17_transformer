Your reference to Disney's cultural free-riding suggests to me that the most profitable resources to plunder are the works and lives of others. Antarctica would be a new frontier, as are the moon and stars, but capitalism thrived by assimilating the worth and exploiting the weakness of pre-existing populations and cultures. For centuries, it has tapped the labor of people held in Malthusian traps. The trans-Atlantic slave trade and the Opium Wars -- now that is disruption. What would the patents to maize, potatoes and tobacco be worth to Monsanto? As we race to the bottom of a depleted well, I imagine there is still a lot to 'go-and-get'.

Have not read Fight Club, only saw the movie version. Do not understand the connection.
Thank you. I was not confident in my source.
My vote for the heaviest McCarthy quote comes from the mouth of his classic sociopath, Anton Chigurh: "If the rule you followed brought you to this, of what use was the rule?" That may be inexact, as I have no copy before me, but it is a grim formula that can be applied to too many of life's outcomes.
A Collapsing Ecosystem Revealed in Owl Vomit
Saudi Arabia also burns oil for electrical generation. They have drained their aquifers empty for such vanity projects as growing wheat in the desert. Maintaining production in their aging oil fields now requires a massive injection of water, to tease oil from the source rock. Does anyone with a petroleum back ground know the source of this water? Is it saltwater or fresh?
Or, they move only to survive. Some were driven from the farm by Malthusian pressure. Some were coerced outright, by eviction from their smallholdings by landlords, who could put the land to a more profitable use -- the Enclosure movement in Britain, for example. Market forces drove a lot of people to the factories, as mechanization undermined the handcrafts and traditional farming. Consider the steady disappearance of the family farm or union worker in this country, or the fate of the owner of a taxi medallion with the appearance of Uber. While the historical trajectory of capitalism has been to greatly increase the stock of goods in the aggregate, whole sectors of the population have often suffered sharply diminished returns. Of course, that is what civilization has always been -- a constant class struggle bumping along a Malthusian path. A more equitable society may not be possible, but we should not idealize the process.
Yes, a perpetual expansion into space seems to be the only alternative to entropic collapse, whether for human or robot. It is of interest that Ray Kurzweil believes that we must be the only (or at least, the most advanced) intelligence in this galaxy. He reasons that if an equivalent intelligence arose anywhere else in the past few million years, it would have evolved its own Singularity, and this technology would have already filled the galaxy. He does not consider the opposing possibility -- that the appearance of a Singularity always destroys its host, and for this reason, we seem to be alone.
The first problem is defining fascism. It is applied to a spectrum of disorders, from ultra-conservative radicals like Franco to the explicitly revolutionary, of which the Nazis were the prime example. They certainly were not conservatives, in any conception of the term. True, the Fascists rose in response to the failure of capitalism, but while vulgar Marxist analysis consider the Nazis to be the mere handmaidens of capitalists, recent scholarship is placing them in fundamental opposition to it. Under their regime, private ownership of capital was only nominal and retained as an expediency. It is certainly a greater canard to compare the Fascists with the non-communist Left, as a central tenet of those movements is toward a universal equality. My view is that the true political form of capitalism is liberalism -- the rule of law protecting individuals pursuits in a free market -- and this is incompatible with goals of Fascism.
Edward Bernays was the nephew of Sigmund Freud. Pioneered the use of psychology in advertising, public relations and propaganda.
Scientists estimate that the Earth contained approximately 1,000 billion tons of carbon in living biomass 2,000 years ago. Since that time, humans have reduced that amount by almost half. It is estimated that just over 10 percent of that biomass was destroyed in just the last century.  This implies that the majority of the biomass loss occurred prior to the 20th century, when the human population increased slowly from a few hundred million to two billion, with minimal energy derived from fossil fuels. If so, that is very alarming  even primitive horticulture, if practiced by hundreds of millions, is not sustainable. Does the full paper make a distinction between the losses due to human activity, and what might have been lost by natural cycles, e.g. the expansion of some of the worlds deserts? Unlike economics, everything obeys the laws of thermodynamics; it is the most undeniable of the sciences. William S. Burroughs observed in his book, Naked Lunch: Thermodynamics has won at a crawl
The author criticizes equating the term 'democratization' with the recent trends in technology or the economy, but the great majority of humanity are much more empowered as consumers than as citizens. A democratic vote was unlikely to have lowered the Confederate flag in S. Carolina, but the prospect of losing a sliver of market share sent Walmart, Amazon, and even Nascar, scurrying into opposition. The Chinese juggernaut does not promise civil rights, it promises more personal consumption, and from this derives legitimacy. Halting the destruction of the biosphere will require both extracting fewer resources and directing much of this into projects of remediation -- the shopping spree must end. This will require a command economy, which is fundamentally in opposition to personal freedom. Will a democratic majority ever freely choose this radical pathway to survival?
I saw the film first, and this detracted nothing from my reading of the novel. Burgess offers a darkly comic satire that questions the basis of human morality and how society responds to deviance. Kubrick (as usual) makes a masterful adaptation and despite the passage of forty-odd years, the cinematography, the costumes and sets still evoke a 'future' to me. As to the original ending to the novel, the missing twenty-first chapter, that was deleted from the American edition. I have not read this ending, but from description, I think it would undercut the central point of the story, and would certainly diminish its delightfully cynical conclusion. Its removal, by the American publisher and then by Kubrick, shows the value added by a good editor.
German Coal: The Complications in Good Intentions
While I agree that nuclear power has never made sense from the EIEO perspective, 438 nuclear plants currently exist and 67 are under construction. Most of the existing reactors are rapidly aging, and governments will incur enormous legacy costs in decommissioning these and disposing of the waste. Debt-burdened, energy-hungry societies are unlikely to meet this challenge, and I believe there is significant danger of a string of Fukushima level events, will can only accelerate the general collapse. Framed in this context, I would think that the Fukushima debacle would be an appropriate topic for debate for this subreddit. In appreciation of the value of this site, I thank you.
I do not understand your criteria for inclusion. If my strident commentary is considered a violation of reddiquette, I can adjust to community standards. Please clarify.
The Ongoing Catastrophe at Fukushima
9 Sobering Facts About California's Groundwater Problem
I must agree. The article quotes from David Roberts recent Vox piece (The awful truth) that slowing the accumulation of greenhouse gases would require an utterly unprecedented level of global mobilization and coordination, sustained over decades. Well, the present global leadership can only coordinate on a single project, one they have diligently pursued for decades  to engineer a complete collapse of the financial system. That approaching failure offers a dim and slim pathway to human survival. Any financial collapse will lead to sharp fall in trade, employment and perceived wealth. Should the plutocratic elites fail to restore a quick prosperity, their flocks of citizen-consumers may stampede and trample them under. A long and violent period of chaos could permit a novel form of government to arise and assume the keys to power. However egalitarian or inclusive, this must be a militant and totalitarian movement, capable of doing whatever is necessary to kick hapless humanity along the hard path to survival. Please, can anyone offer a more peaceful, democratic and voluntary solution to our existential crisis?
English was not Nabokov's first language either. He was Russian exile from the Bolshevik Revolution, and I recall that he wrote novels in German while living there, before his peregrinations took him to France and eventually to the USA. English might have been his third or fourth language; if so, as does Conrad, he leaves we who scribble in our native language with a great embarrassment.
An Indicator of an Epic El Nino?
Are they culturing mammalian cells to produce this artificial meat? If so, scaling up the process would be a continuous challenge, as cell culture requires stringently sterile procedures to prevent contamination by opportunistic bacteria, fungi, etc. The current beef industry is heavily dependent on antibiotics, which are becoming ineffective, and at least a cow has an immune system. My favorite ice cream manufacturer is currently on hiatus, as it attempts to cleanse its facilities of Lysteria, so I am skeptical of the commercial viability of artificial meat.
Suffering from Nervous Exhaustion, Thomas Friedman Cuts-and-Pastes His New Op-ed
I also reject from the premise of this article. The Soviet Empire was a collection of deeply rooted nations with aspirations for independence. The senile and dispirited Communist leadership had no stomach for the bloodshed necessary to preserve their faltering system  Gorbachev could not be Stalin. The lesser ranks of the regime were eager to loot the accumulated assets of the Soviet State, especially its vast extractive industries of fossil fuels and minerals. A repressive civil war would have threaten this windfall, so they let wayward sisters go in peace, cashed in, and instantly became valued members of the Global Plutocracy.  As has been noted, the Global Plutocracy already owns the USA, and they would never permit its dissolution. Only the clashing interests of the advancing capitalists of North and the slave owners of the antiquated South stumbled this nation into its prior War Between the States. Our plutocrats may squabble over political offices and lifestyle choices, but they will always coalesce in firm defense of their vital interests, which are nearly identical.  Yes, this North American franchise suffers from sharp ethnic and class divisions, but I doubt these can congeal into any loci of secession. An African American insurgency has no viable geographical refuge, and the threat of white separatists is a myth propagated by the Southern Poverty Law Center to raise donations. As for Mexican-Americans, their entry into the USA was an aspirational choice, and they intend to stay within it. As for those three hundred million guns in private hands, mere sentiment will turn most of them against any incipient rebellion  the NRA is not a revolutionary organization.  As the military forces of the USA begin an inexorable retreat from overseas adventures, they are well prepared to retain control of their Homeland. The returning units are expert in counter insurgency, and one patriotic SEAL sniper could suppress any Ferguson level disturbance. The vast prison system is already full, but the reversal of a few court orders can quickly multiply its capacity. Most key has been the creation of a ubiquitous surveillance apparatus; however ineffective it is against terrorist plots, it will provide a backdated guide to all opposition to the regime. Take care, all you Twittering fools, the NSA is always listening. Keep watching the skies, for the silent drone. Will your bug-splat appear on Google Maps?
Let us agree that this rip roaring, fossil-fueled civilization is doomed to collapse. Can we sustain some useful, technological remnant of it, or should we acquiesce to pseudo-medieval world projected by Kunstler and Greer? I remember a quote to the affect that the barbarism that follows the fall of a civilization is much greater than what proceeded it and am not sanguine about billions of hominids transitioning gracefully to a hand-made world ruled by Druids. I do care about a few of the people who will inhabit that Future.  After reading the article and the appended commentary, I understand the mere engineering (never mind, the political obstacles) is daunting. I direct your attention to an article in Aeon Magazine, by Lewis Darnell, titled Out of the Ashes. http://aeon.co/magazine/technology/could-we-reboot-civilisation-without-fossil-fuels/ He considers whether we could rebuild such a technological remnant after our collapse, in the absence of fossil fuels. Most pertinent to this present discussion is his description of the steel industry of Brazil, which they largely fuel with charcoal harvested from eucalyptus plantations. As Brazil is the ninth largest steel producer, this is an ember of promise, if coupled with sugar cane derived alcohol for vehicular fuel. My search of r/collapse did not find a prior posting of this article, so I will also post it separately.
And then, It Came for Our Bananas...
This stunt is not space travel, only the world's most expensive amusement ride. The pompous billionaire prattles about orbiting Virgin Galactic hotels, yet orbital flight would require an expenditure of approx. 18 fold more energy and a much more robust vehicle.
From Hippie to Corporate Tool  the Odyssey of Stewart Brand.
While climate science is making rapid advances, how quickly and to what extent this amplified greenhouse effect will perturb the ocean currents will remain uncertain  for any analysis, these represent a most complex heat engine. In my original comment, I did not intend to suggest a Canfield Ocean (and its Green Sky) is an imminent event, only that the paleontological record does suggest this as a mechanism for previous mass extinctions, and that experts in the field do find an ominous parallel in our ongoing alteration of this planets atmosphere. I am certain that most of the followers of Collapse would agree this is the ultimate monstrous crow; the basic chemistry and physics of the process are, frankly, undeniable, and I believe we can now hear the flap of its wings.  However, this distant, future event should not concern Disingenuous. There is no danger of NBA cancelling the current Finals for a Green Sky.
