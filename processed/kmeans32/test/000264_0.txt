The gay rainbow flag, writes Breitbarts Editor-at-Large John Nolte, is seen by many Christians as a symbol of hate and oppression, and for good reason. Under that banner, there has been an all-out assault by the media and the Left against our religious freedoms.
A Kentucky county clerk testified that she could not issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples because signing the document would signal her approval of a union that violates her religious beliefs. She said that she prayed and fasted for months before reaching the decision.

let's take it from the top, shall we?  someone's sexuality is literally none of your goddamn business. if they want to serve their country by joining up, then more power to them. YOU  do not get a say.   end of story. there's no big discussion to be had. sexuality has nothing to do with how well you do your job. the only problem arises when OTHER people go out of their way to make it a problem.  get over it, people are gay. people have been gay since the dawn of time. people will continue to be gay, wanna know why? because they're born that way.  seriously, join the 21st century already, we're moving on, so come along or get out the way. no one is stopping for you.
i'm leaving their comment up because you have an excellent reply, even tho their account was a throwaway. it's not the first time it was brought up, and it wont be the last, so the more often we reply to it, the more little bits and pieces of a rational repudiation of that position gets added to the narrative.

you're at the inbetweeny stage right now, and that's one of the worst parts of transitioning. EVERYTHING was hard for me and i found myself questioning my sanity on a daily basis. but even then, i knew there was no going back for me. i tried being the boy everybody told me i was. but deep down inside, i knew i was a girl. and deep down inside, i think you know it too, i think a LOT of us know that. hang on, this will pass.  and one thing i know is that you are NOT alone, we're all here for you.
the polls show that a majority of the rank and file republicans are fine with same-sex marriage and lgbt culture in general. it's the leaders and the vocal minority of social conservatives that drive the narrative. that's why the talking heads can rant about it, but most serious politicians(i.e. the ones that want to win) wont touch it with a ten foot pole.
Because I'm not being transphobic. I'm considering everyone's comfort.. Not just the selfish transgender (wo)man i'm talking too  no, you're not, you're basically saying that YOU arent comfortable with trans people. that's it. you do not speak for anybody else.   Simply put, I do not care one bit if you want to go so crazy as to slap on a pair of leggings, a tutu and a bright orange neon thong, prance around and sing I'm a barbie girl followed up with whatever the hell girls do.  and sexist too, nice.   I however do not think you need to be in a restroom where many people expect a certain level of privacy from members of the opposite sex. You are not physically built like a woman. This can cause discomfort to people who are.  again, transphobic. even after i posted the study of all the schools, comprising 600k students where transgender polices are in effect showing that there have been ZERO incidents.  The best response you have to this is to keep saying it doesn't because "there are no recorded incidents" Is a totally dishonest way to debate seeing as there are pretty much no studies out there taking into consideration how the physically male and female students feel about it. At least none that are easily accessible. I can find a grand total of 3 quotes from students forced to share the restroom.  if there have been no reported incidents, then there is no reason to restrict access. like i sed, you have a solution in search of a problem.  I'm misgendering you because you're not even reading a damn word I say and overall being very disingenuous in how you are conducting this discussion... If you can call it that. I don't respect you enough to give a shit what you think you are at this point.  so basically you made up a reason for misgendering me. gotcha  like i said, there are none so blind as those who cannot see their own privilege or transphobia. just like the fundies.
nope
there are several medical associations that would disagree with you  **American Medical Association**   Resolution: Removing Financial Barriers to Care for Transgender Patients (2008)   An established body of medical research demonstrates the effectiveness and medical necessity of mental health care, hormone therapy and sex reassignment surgery as forms of therapeutic treatment for many people diagnosed with GID Therefore, be it RESOLVED, that the AMA supports public and private health insurance coverage for  treatment of gender identity disorder. http://www.tgender.net/taw/ama_resolutions.pdf   Resolution H-185.950: Removing Financial Barriers to Care for Transgender Patients (2008)   Our AMA supports public and private health insurance coverage for treatment of gender identity disorder as recommended by the patients physician. (Res. 122; A-08)   http://www.ama-assn.org/resources/doc/PolicyFinder/policyfiles/HnE/H-185.950.HTM  **American Psychiatric Association**   Position Statement on Access to Care for Transgender and Gender Variant Individuals (2012)    The American Psychiatric Association:   1. Recognizes that appropriately evaluated transgender and gender variant individuals can benefit greatly from medical and surgical gender transition treatments.   2. Advocates for removal of barriers to care and supports both public and private health insurance coverage for gender transition treatment.   3. Opposes categorical exclusions of coverage for such medically necessary treatment when prescribed by a physician.    www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Advocacy%20and%20Newsroom/Position%20Statements/ps2012_TransgenderCare.pdf   Position Statement on Discrimination Against Transgender and Gender Variant Individuals (2012)    Being transgender gender or variant implies no impairment in judgment, stability, reliability, or general social or vocational capabilities; however, these individuals often experience discrimination due to a lack of civil rights protections for their gender identity or expression Thus, this position statement is relevant to the APA because discrimination and lack of equal civil rights is damaging to the mental health of  transgender and gender variant individuals.    **The American Psychiatric Association:**   1. Supports laws that protect the civil rights of transgender and gender variant individuals.   2. Urges the repeal of laws and policies that discriminate against transgender and gender variant individuals.   3. Opposes all public and private discrimination against transgender and gender variant individuals in such areas as health care, employment, housing, public accommodation, education, and licensing.   4. Declares that no burden of proof of such judgment, capacity, or reliability shall be placed upon these individuals greater than that imposed on any other persons. www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Advocacy%20and%20Newsroom/Position%20Statements/ps2012_TransgenderDiscrimination.pdf  American Psychological Association Policy on Transgender, Gender Identity   Gender Expression Non-Discrimination (2008) As stated in the Policy on Transgender, Gender Identity   Gender Expression NonDiscrimination, the APA opposes all public and private discrimination on the basis of actual or perceived gender identity and expression and urges the repeal of discriminatory laws and policies and calls upon psychologists in their professional roles to provide appropriate, nondiscriminatory treatment to transgender and gender variant individuals and encourages psychologists to take a leadership role in working against discrimination towards transgender and gender variant individuals.   The APA recognizes the efficacy, benefit and medical necessity of gender transition treatments for appropriately evaluated individuals and calls upon public and private insurers to cover these medically necessary treatments.   http://www.apa.org/about/policy/transgender.aspx  **American Academy of Family Physicians**   Resolution No. 1004 (2012) In 2007, an AAFP Commission declared that the association has a policy opposing any form of patient discrimination and stated its opposition to the exclusion of transgender health care. In 2012, the organization released a new resolution: RESOLVED, That the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) support efforts to require insurers to provide coverage for comprehensive care of [transgender] individuals including medical care, screening tests based on medical need rather than gender, mental health care, and, when medically necessary, gender reassignment surgery. http://www.aafp.org/dam/AAFP/documents/about_us/special_constituencies/2012RCAR_Advocacy.pdf  **American Academy of Physician Assistants**   Non-Discrimination Statement  (Adopted 2000; amended 2004, 2006, 2007 and 2008) Physician assistants should not discriminate against classes or categories of patients in the delivery of needed health care. Such classes and categories includegender identity.  **American College of Nurse Midwives**   Transgender/Transsexual/Gender Variant Health Care (2012) The American College of Nurse-Midwives (ACNM) supports efforts to provide transgender, transsexual, and gender variant individuals with access to safe, comprehensive, culturally competent health care and therefore endorses the 2011 World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) Standards of Care  Please see Ethical Conduct for the Physician Assistant Profession (Adopted 2000, amended 2004, 2006, 2007, and 2008) and Comprehensive Health Care Reform (Adopted 2005 and amended 2010).   **National Association of Social Workers**   Transgender and Gender Identity Issues Policy Statement (2008)  NASW supports the rights of all individuals to receive health insurance and other health coverage without discrimination on the basis of gender identity, and specifically without exclusion of services related to transgender or transsexual transitionin order to receive medical and mental health services through their primary care physician and the appropriate referrals to medical specialists, which may include hormone replacement therapy, surgical interventions, prosthetic devices, and other medical procedures.   http://www.socialworkers.org/da/da2008/finalvoting/documents/Transgender%202nd%20round%20-%20Clean.pdf  **World Professional Association for Transgender Health**   Clarification on Medical Necessity of Treatment, Sex Reassignment, and Insurance Coverage in the U.S.A. (2008)   WPATH found that decades of experience with the Standards of Care show gender transitions and related care to be accepted, good medical practice and effective treatment.   In a 2008 clarification, WPATH stated:  [S]ex reassignment, properly indicated and performed as provided by the Standards of Care, has proven to be beneficial and effective in the treatment of individuals with transsexualism, gender identity disorder, and/or gender dysphoria. Sex reassignment plays an undisputed role in contributing toward favorable outcomes, and comprises Real Life Experience, legal name and sex change on identity documents, as well as medically necessary hormone treatment, counseling, psychotherapy, and other medical procedures...   The medical procedures attendant to sex reassignment are not cosmetic or elective or for the mere convenience of the patient. These reconstructive procedures are not optional in any meaningful sense, but are understood to be medically necessary for the treatment of the diagnosed condition. http://www.wpath.org/documents/Med%20Nec%20on%202008%20Letterhead.pdf  **National Commission on Correctional Health Care**   Position Statement: Transgender Health Care in Correctional Settings (2009)   The health risks of overlooking the particular needs of transgender inmates are so severe that acknowledgment of the problem and policies that assure appropriate and responsible provision of health care are needed.   Because prisons, jails, and juvenile justice facilities have a responsibility to ensure the physical and mental health and well-being of transgender people in their custody, correctional health staff should manage these inmates in a manner that respects the biomedical and psychological aspects of a gender identity disorder (GID) diagnosis.   http://www.ncchc.org/transgender-health-care-in-correctional-settings

it's always a god for you. cant you see that it's a better world when you realize that there is no god? that you have but one life to live.  you could have easily ended the convo hours ago, by simply pointing out proof, ANY proof that your god exists. you havent, so we go on dancing. i'm quite enjoying this. i can to tell you that there is no god, and there's nothing you can do about it, because you know i'm right.   amazing isnt it? one simple statement of fact as opposed to reams and reams of oratory as priests and pastors struggle to try and convince the flock every weekend that there is a god when half of them dont believe it themselves.  so, in conclusion, i submit, yet again, that there is no god.
yeah
yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeup
i dont think anybody here is under any illusions that bernie will win the nomination. what he's doing is shifting the conversation and the attitudes of the democrats to the left, where they should be. if the tea party shows us where the hard right is, then bernie shows us where the hard left is.
first and second trimester, the fetus is dependant on the mother's body to survive, therefore any and all medical decisions, including whether or not to abort lies solely with the mother. end of story. you may not agree with it, but if we cannot force someone to get a blood transfusion to save their life, and we cannot harvest viable organs from their body after they die, then we cannot force a person not to have an abortion. it's really that simple.
there are none so blind as those who cannot see.  dude, drop it already. if you cant see that your position goes against the collective procedures of every single medical organization on this planet, then i cant help you.  the only people still advocating for conversion therapy are religious organizations.   seriously, let it go, you'll be a happier person.
