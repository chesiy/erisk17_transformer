I also just saw Southpaw (no spoilers)   All I can say is wow. Jake Gyllenhaal is unrecognizable from his character in Nightcrawler and did a phenomenal job which just goes to show the range he can achieve. While the plot is a little predictable, the movie really is great and the performances are very believable (especially from the daughter, Oona Laurence). On a final note, James Horner's score was amazing and really added to the feel of the whole movie. As someone who's not really into sports films, this movie really was wonderful and I recommend you all go see it if you get the chance.
I think the thing with that is that he genuinely seems to be happy with whatever he's got. He's not super picky.
I absolutely agree.
Oh, I do. :)
DUDE! Tokyo Drift is the best one!
First: 2007 Suzuki SX4 Automatic  That car has a lot of sentimental value to me and I get a little happy when I see them.  Now: 2004 Subaru WRX 5-Speed  I fucking love this car. Period.
[Meta] Sorry for inactivity   I just thought I'd give a reason. I've been getting ready and packing and stuff and moved into my dorms today. I should be posting regularly again this week.

Not at all, I was just clarifying.
Liechtenstein would like to negotiate the annexation of Kaliningrad Oblast since it is an exclave and not connected to the main land of Russia.  Its name will most likely become the previous name of its capital, Knigsberg while the capital will remain Kaliningrad.   Its population sits at just over 940,000 at the moment and its GDP is about US$14,000 per capita. Unfortunately, both have been falling. Liechtenstein hopes to reverse this buy boosting investors and helping with overall quality of life.  The population is currently 86% Russian with the rest being made up of various Eastern European demographics.   We hope to make use of its ice-less ports and make it Liechtenstein's center for sea trade. We also hope to utilize its tourism, amber deposits, fishing industry, and boat and auto manufacturing to continue to boost its own economy and help our own.
Hey, now. Don't start this.

You can expect them within the month.
[News] Hchste Kaiser's Word   Welcome to your yearly programming of Hchste Kaiser's Word 2021! We're your new news team!  To start things off, the reason why we're here. At the beginning of the year, our great leader personally executed the previous mess team upon finding evidence that they were leaking confidential information to the terrorist organization that was attacking the country and other nations. He ended the executions stating that betrayal will never be tolerated.  On a lighter note, Liechtenstein announced the plans for its very own car company this year! So far all we know is that Kaiserwagen will be selling all over the world and will include cars of all types.  Next, the terrorist organization that had been attacking innocent civilians and government facilities has finally been out down. A defector informed The government of the organization's location and, upon further investigation, SHIT squads were sent in and all terrorists were either killed or captured. The next month after questioning, all captured members were personally executed by Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429. The organization's leader was never named.  Continuing military news, the government revealed its intentions to design and mass produce a new military all terrain vehicle. The vehicle is being designed in collaboration between Loechtenstein and France and is expected to begin mass production within this next year. Designs have yet to be released.  On a much sadder note, our great leader revealed that he had, until recently, forgotten his own title. And then, to add insult to injury, Hchste Kaiser offered diplomatic relations to a leader that was no longer in power. The whole country joined our great leader to wallow in depression for a few days.  Well, that wraps it up for Hchste Kaiser's Word, your only choice in Liechtenstein news. Tune in next year.

[Event] Liechtenstein extends a welcoming hand to Luxembourg's new AI leaders   Despite the controversy that the seizing of power has caused, we believe that the instant decision to declare war on your nation is a very rash decision. Therefore, Liechtenstein would like to extend its congratulations and hopes that, upon the reopening of the borders, Luxembourg would be willing to peacefully negotiate trade relations amongst other things with the people of Liechtenstein.  Hopefully,  Hchste Kaiser of Liechtenstein, /u/test_subject7429  Meta Edit: Shit.
Liechtenstein commends you for the way you think.
Jesus, for a second I thought he was.
I've seen them twice now and let me just say that they are the only opening band I've ever seen with so much enthusiasm. They got the entire room moshing. It was fantastic.
[Event] Terrorism escalates   In the last couple of months there have been three more terrorist explosive attacks. One on a military training facility and two in busy public areas. Liechtenstein's original ideas on the size of this group are either too small or the group is in much deeper than the government originally anticipated. Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 has dispatched multiple SHIT squads and even sent some private agents to various areas to investigate these attacks.   The entire country's militarization has had little affect on the terrorist attacks as they have all been carried out by lone men and been swift and without warning.   Hchste Kaiser has voiced his outrage at the terrorists' willingness to harm unarmed civilians and directly disrespect his own rule over the country. He has stated that he will not stop until the group's leader and all of its members are killed or captured and that he is willing to take drastic measures to do so.
Sir, you have your self a deal. Maybe we can even go one step further... And build both.
There's a whole sub if you didn't know! /r/reclaimedbynature sadly it doesn't seem to be very active at this time.
I think it's amazing. You should at least give it a try.

I finally get to one of these early enough and I can't think of a question! I'll just settle with saying that the game looks amazing and I'm excited to see where else it goes! Big fan of Obsidion. Good luck!  Edit: OOH! I thought of some. What thing about PoE has you most excited? Also, what would you say is the most unique thing about the game?
Oh, I see. Thanks!
Well, to have a subreddit about the lack of belief in something makes no sense. It's the same as having a subreddit for people who don't like the color blue or don't use Netflix. An anti circle jerk is pretty likely for such a pointless idea. I don't feel superior, I just think that the idea is ridiculous.
Don't need none'a that here!
I was seriously thinking it was the one I usually go to.... But your comment has made me second guess myself.
I finished that game for the first time since buying it years ago.... And it felt great.
FUCK YOU, FERD, YOU UNFABULOUS SHIT  Edit: Why the *fuck* do I keep seeing you?!
There's an arcade game called T.E.C. 3001. It's awesome.  Edit: Indie*
