Here here!  It is insane to do the same thing over and over and expecting different results. When the rhetoric dusts settles down in the years to come, history will show Obama had the right approach and he will be remembered for it. That is unless we elect Scott Walker and he goes to war with Iran on day one of his presidency.  We have been doing this for decades and it had been a total failure. The time has come to put an end to this insanity.
:D
I wouldn't miss it for anything. It's going to be a circus and a half. :D

I bet. For us it is like a hurricane. We haven't seen it in so long. Big for us. Probably sprinkles to those in the mid-West. But we'll take it. :D
Not on purpose but yes; tremendously.

#AWESOME!
Thank you. Your post is all set. Good luck. :D
Scott Walker for President
Don't bother me a bit. If you see something you already saw, just move on,. My god it is not the end of the world. And lots of times I miss things the first time they were posted.
No the evidence came from the administrators. No one seemed to know the actual events so I asked the administrators. As you can see,  the head mod demodded everyone and wrote a letter to the administrators. This occurred long after sue had left the subreddit. The evidence presented came from the administrators.   That is the only evidence provided by anyone here. Everything else was just people repeating speculation by an anonymous person no one seems to know the identity of.   I remember vouching for people long ago. It was a huge mistake. I was right hundreds of times but the few times I was wrong cancelled that out. So we never do that anymore.
Oh. I am going between many questions on many posts.   I have an issue that is current. It has nothing to do with past mistakes. Sure i have made some but that is not what I am asking to address. You guys have crucified one of my mods. I have proof that shows you were wrong. I want the ability to present that evidence in a fair forum. Not with crazy people like jenz screaming out of control. I want to talk with sane people who are willing to listen. That is what this post is asking for.
I have restored the post. Thank you for registering.  Could you please remove your email address though. Only supply that by a PM. It's for your own safety we ask this.  Good luck to you. :D
I have no room to talk. I'm trying to work up the balls to do this myself. I just see your week as an enormous accomplishment. I am jealous. I would hate to see it go to waste.

You are all set. Good luck. :D
Great. I am so glad to hear that. Go ahead and make your post again any time you like. :D
Horseshit!   One of **his** biggest crowds. Not one of **the** biggest crowds. So he filled a high school gymnasium. Hillary had twice that many last week.   Words like massive, astronautical, huge, and others like are being thrown about in extremely  exaggerated and misused. Have fun with your little circle jerk and watch as he fades into obscurity just like Ron Paul when you blathered over him.

A Simple Guide To The Iranian Nuclear Deal   	Two types of nuclear weapons material: Uranium, which is mined. And Plutonium, which produced.  	Uranium needs to be about 90% pure to work in a nuclear weapon and only 5% for a power plant  	They have been enriching it to 20% - The agreement is that will stop  and they will only enrich it past 3.67% for 15 years  	They currently have 2200 pounds of the 20% enriched. They have agreed to give up 97% they already have.  	It is enriched by centrifuges.  There are two types.   	One is designed in the 70s which runs on very old outdate software comparable to an Atari game.  	The other is a high tech version that is much faster   efficiently  Iran has none and will not be allowed to have any of these.  	Iran currently has 19,000 of the old inefficient type.  	The deal specifies this number be reduced to 6,000. And only the old and inefficient ones  	Iran would be allowed to conduct research and development on advanced centrifuges. But not produced or possess them.  	 Two ways to make plutonium:   	Spent fuel rods used in enriching uranium can be used to make plutonium. Iran does not have this reprocessing ability. The deal specifies they cannot seek to gain this knowledge or ability and bans such processing plants.  	The second way is a reactor that is specifically designed to produce it. Iran currently has one such reactor that is not yet operational.   	The deal specifies this core from this facility be  destroyed or removed from the country   	Anything produced from this facility is required to be shipped out of the country.  	The other underground facility would partly converted to advanced nuclear research and the production of medical isotopes. About two thirds of its centrifuges would be removed. Foreign scientists would be present. It would have no fissile material that could be used to make a bomb.  	This was one of Israels biggest concerns   	Unprecedented levels of inspections including on site inspectors, camera and Seals. Uranium is tracked from the time it comes out of the ground, through the processing until it is stored in cylinders. Ability to see what they are importing and exporting. Inventory control.  	Inspections anywhere in the country that could investigate suspicious sites or allegations of a covert enrichment facility. (details still be worked out)  	The issue of when the sanctions are to be removed still looms as one of the potential obstacles to a final agreement on June 30.  	UN Security Council resolutions on Irans nuclear program will be lifted simultaneously. A transparent procurement channel will be established, allowing Iran to get what it needs for civilian nuclear development while giving assurances to the world that the materials will not be diverted for non-peaceful use.  	 International cooperation to help Iran in research and development.

Out-extreming the extremists - Or my day at my mom's birthday party.   Today I went to my sister's house for my mom's birthday. I kind of hate going to stuff like that because I always have to hear all that right-wing extremist crap. I mean they make FOX News look liberal. Especially my evil brother. The ignorance that comes out of his mouth is excruciating. I gave up long ago trying discuss anything with him.  So they are going on and on about the football player that beat his wife and the black guy that got killed in Ferguson and somehow made it about how unfair they were being to white people. How they got there I will never know. I was just biting my tongue but finally mentioned Zimmerman. The conversation went on without my participation but it was just so vile and ignorant. Talking about how unfair Zimmerman was treated and what a piece of shit the kid that got killed was. And how the black guy that got killed in Ferguson ruined that cops's life. After several minutes of listening to this garbage, I finally just stood up and said:  "Yea..., those fucking niggers!"  Everyone just went silent and gasped. Even though for the last 20 minutes, that's what they had been basically saying. They thought it was horrible how I paraphrased it for them. They were not happy with me today. But I was giggling to myself how I actually out-extremed the extremists.
Does your vote count?   Yes. In fact your votes are the only ones that matter. Elections are not decided by republicans or democrats. Their votes basically cancel each other out. They sway from one side back and forth, but rarely are the deciding factor.  In most presidential elections, the percentage difference is around 5%. If all the people who say their vote doesn't matter would vote, then they would matter. They would easily sway the vote one way or the other. The direction our country takes can easily be changed by a small percentage that does not vote. The very people who say their vote does not count.  **In practical reality, your votes are the only ones that do count.**
