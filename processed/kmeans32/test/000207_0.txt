Hahaha, nah, its just a massive pork meatball that melts in the mouth. I've never been a steak kinda gal but I imagine this is what it'd be like.   Its only called Lionshead due to the sheer size- about the size of your hands fisted together

**Chunking Express** (1994)- I'm making my way through Asian films this summer and started with Wong Kar Wai. I loved Takeshi Kaneshiro in this and how his character thinks himself as a man but really is just a boy.
Congrats!

Yes!!!
I agree with what you're saying on The Secret Life of Walter Mitty too. For me, Drive: story line was poor but man, if you can watch it and completely tune out what they're saying and just listen to the music...  Sometime Wes Anderson's stuff, The Grand Budapest Hotel in particular. I found the story to be the blandest out of his work but the sheer attention to detail is overwhelming. I recently read an article about the set design and how the word 'patisserie' on Mendl's boxes was spelt wrong and Anderson picked up on it and had it corrected in post-production.   Edit: perhaps not *disproportionately* good but John Wick had beautiful visuals and soundtrack too, especially considering the storyline
True dat
Is it possible that they are heat rashes? If so, go to your local supermarket or pharmacy and ask for 'fei zi fen= ' I know Johnson's baby do one and it comes in a pouch (like a yoghurt pouch) and apply this on the areas and areas of high humidity like armpit, inner elbows, back of knee.  When I was younger, going to the south like Si Chuan and Jiang Su always broke me out in heat rashes as I couldn't acclimatise to the humidity or heat.
Heroine Kiss Me Volume   Curl... let me down   I just got the Heroine Kiss Me Volume and Curl today after waiting 2 weeks and I have to say... I'm really disappointed, especially since this mascara gets so much love from this community.  This mascara makes my lashes so clumpy and they feel *crunchy*- like how your hair feels if you've used too much hairspray.  I literally did the wiggle at the roots and brush up, and waited about 30 secs to let it dry and tried a second coat, which just completely grouped my lashes together.  If I do a gentle rub along my eyelid when my contacts move about, my lashes move together and stick together.  Did I get a complete dud or am I doing this thing wrong- does this mascara need to be dried out a little to work better like the Lanme Hypnse? Was anyone else really disappointed with the results?
I'm warming up to it but the original inspo was just a few nails bare and nude on the rest  edit: added the inspiration picture cause my description sucked
Really pleased with my second attempt at nail art!
I skip the last few steps in my routine when its humid, i.e. Origins Overnight Treatment, Innisfree Green Tea Sleeping Pack  On the central line today I could bear it no longer, I brought out my facial mist from Tosowoong and doused myself in the land-of-no-AC
To be honest, I haven't tried the other formulation so I don't really know, the brightening one is very runny though, the essence drips down my neck so I have to have it on lying down haha. You're probably off buying them on RRS buy the box really, they probably work out to be cheaper like that anyway.  Oh RRS totally mark down the value of things so go wild next time, my $90 order was marked as $7 and Jolse marked a $30 to $7 too! I was really nervous the first time I ordered from them both but was really surprised and ecstatic when they came!
Missha Time Revolution line   I have been refreshing RRS for 6 consecutive days trying to buy the Longer Name ampoule to surprise my mum who is soon returning from a 3 month work trip, but to no avail (does this mean its sold out?). Is there is anything you would recommend from the line excluding the FTE, targeting PIH and ageing skin?
Yeah, Chengdu is definitely more of a business hub these days and I'm confident Chengdu will have a Sasa. Personally I wouldn't buy anything in Sasa in store, there aren't really any 'exclusives' that you won't be able to get elsewhere online. I do normally buy MBD masks from Watson's though, they're around 88 RMB for me, so like 8 and about $10 if you're in the US?  I'm actually based in the UK haha, but I was born in Beijing and lived there till I was 5, and spend my summers there (will be heading home next week wooo!). I did use SAL shipping on Rakuten to avoid some cheeky EMS customs issues though  P.S. Remind him to keep hydrated, I know Chengdu is an absolute boiler of a place and personally, I can't stand the humidity and heat there, seeing as London gets to ~27 degrees max. If he gets heat rashes the Johnson's Baby Heat Rash powder (comes in a pouch like a yoghurt pouch) one is good to dust on and available at most supermarkets. My nearest 7/11 in Beijing has them too!

Hi, I'm in the UK and my flair thread is [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/mueflair/comments/3aoh31/test_subject6267_flair_thread/)
Yeah of course, take your time! I'll PM you the total price and my details.
Lamb stew at a 'xiaochi' in Beijing
Makeup Revolution Highlighter   Has anyone else tried this highlighter? I finally managed to hunt it down in Superdrug the other day, swatched it on my inner wrist and proceeded to wander around the store. About 5 mins later, I looked at my wrist and the intense shimmer had faded to the subtlety of the Hourglass Ambience Lighting powders!   I have seen blogs saying its comparable to the Mary-Loumanizer but I was so disappointed when I tried this one out, it looked so incredible in the pan :(
My cousins dog sits very particularly...
Yeah, the BHA sample is from them, I'm not quite sure when I'll be able to use it though.. it seems like such a small amount.  I tried everything last night except the AHA, but I'm going to put them through more use to get a better feel though. I found the CosRX Snail Mucin so weird though, I put one pump onto my palm and used my fingers to spread out on my face and it just had the biggest trail. The texture is a little odd at first but it did moisturise quite nicely overnight.
The waiting is the hardest part! The first 2 days I was obsessively tracking where the orders were but eventually I just gave up cause after I saw it had arrived in Europe, there weren't any other updates.  Excited for you to get your products though!!
This varies from region to region, in Beijing, we have it for breakfast and its a lot thicker, consisting of tofu, mu er and huang hua and has a deep, almost smoky taste to it
I'm Chinese and was born In Beijing but raised in London so here are some places my family and friends go to, usually for ~5-10 people, with a small summary of what I remember:   **Food**  - Cats eye pizza (various locations) -Supposedly opened by a guy who used to work at Pizza Hut then opened his own place.... But decent enough western food and very cheap, pizza is about 25-40 depending on toppings. I love their desserts and always order plenty to share.  - Gong de lin  (Qian men, Dongcheng) VEG  Personally not for me but the vegetarians in my family love it, lots of mushroom (bai ling gu ) dishes made into meat like dishes. Its usually really cramped there though but they have some signature Buddist dishes.  - Jin Si Shu Shi Fang  (Xizhimenwai, Haidian) VEG  LOVE THIS PLACE, its a tad expensive for just vegetarian dishes but they also cater for vegans. They make a really good sausage out of  as well, as well as a 'jiao liu rou pian ' out of the mushrooms too. Sadly their Dongsi branch has closed due to government demolition (perils of being in Beijing) but the Dong Zhi Men branch is just as good. I would definitely buy dinner there, vegetarians or otherwise.   - Quan ju de  various locations, Qian Men is OG)  Not Beijing if you ain't eaten their duck. 'Nuff said.  - Song he lou   (Nanlishimen, Xicheng= my ends or Zhizhuyuan, Haidian)  Excellent  song shu gui y, definitely something to photograph. Veers on expensive side but one of Ba Da Lou, so basically, a must. Very enjoyable Huai yang cai, try their meatball soup, extremely tender pork and 'melts in the mouth' as some may say. They also do a lovely Shui Jian Bao, very crispy and mince inside is well seasoned.  -  Dong Xing Lou (Tongxian, Tongzhou)  Another nice place to eat, they have quite a few sea cucumber dishes that are nice, but its a bit of a trek seeing as it's in Tongxian  -  Tong Ren Ju (Haidian)   Open space with large upper floor. If you go, appreciate the high ceilings and the balconied corridor of the first floor rarely seen in Beijing restaurants. I had the best spring onion pancakes *of my life* (they are 'pull apart-esque'), a huge statement as I eat spring onion pancakes almost daily.  - Sizzler (various locations)  For when you're just craving a steak, took an American friend I met in Sanlitun (surprise surprise) who was craving TGI Friday's. Very basic, but good western style buffet salad bar.  STREET FOOD IN GENERAL 3  **Drinks**  Honestly, Sanlitun is for foreigners (no offense, but really, c'mon) and I have been to a fair few bars there few underage, so I really can't say I have enjoyed many bars in Sanlitun.   Seeing as booze is so cheap in Beijing, why not just buy a bottle and stay home? If you want to go out and drink though, I think just ordering drinks with food or best of all, with small eats and KTV!!  I would recommend to stay away from the Western food though, theres nothing better than Xiao Chi in China (trust me, I used to go eat Western food a lot in Bejing and you just feel like you've missed out on a chance to try great food, especially as the Western foods aren't as authentic as the original)  Apologies for the mix of Pin Yin and Han Zi, I have being studying the whole day for the next 3 weeks of A Level exams but I really wanted to recommend some places.  Enjoy eating!!
Thank you thank you!! Should I just use the BHA or AHA just in the evenings? I think if I used it twice a day, it would be a bit too much. I'll probably go with the Mizon snail repair cream, it seems to be quite popular, thank you again!!!
