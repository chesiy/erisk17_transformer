This Guy's Crazy Art Project in the Nevada Desert at newly Formed Basin and Range National Monument Is 2016's Sleeper Campaign Issue
The fight over states having control over federal land is an issue that has remained an undercurrent, but has the potential to become something much bigger. There is a concerted effort by Republicans to open up national parks to mining and oli interests, as well as prevent more land becoming part of the national park system.

Do you live in a city that has a Goodwill Outlet in it? (not a regular Goodwill store -- an outlet store). If you do, you should be able to make quite a bit more than that (although you will need to have a small amount to get started -- $20 - $50) -- getting the goods isn't online, but you would be selling them on eBay, so it really is work at home work.
Be very careful -- there are very few things where you can make money without spending time at it.  A big step you need to take is to begin looking for a new job if you hate it. You obviously don't want to quit if you need the money, but that doesn't stop you from looking for something else that pays the same or more that you would enjoy more. That seems like a bigger issue than finding a side income.  If you want to transition a side income job to replace your current income, you'll need to spend time on it. There is no way around that. What you probably need to do is create a list of things you like to do so you can get some idea of what type of side income you'd like to try and create.
The Fallen: Joshua Tree national park
This new national monument is unique in its size and proximity to major urban centers of northern California. Situated only 100 miles from the Bay Area and Sacramento, Berryessa Snow Mountain spans 100 miles north to south. The area offers significant opportunities for exceedingly rare long-distance mountain biking trails and critical connectivity to both the Mendocino National Forest and the Bay Area Ridge Trail.

OK, I'm not sure if this will work for new members, but since it's a pretty big one, It's probably worth a try. Panera Bread members have received notice that they get a free cup of ice or hot coffee each day for the month of July. Not sure if those who sign up now will also get it, but it might be worth a try: sign up for their rewards program [here](https://www.panerabread.com/en-us/home.html)

It's actually much worse -- this is the first phase of the study that included 40 of the 118 park units which are likely at risk. The other parks will be evaluated in later phases, so this amount is sure to rise. It also doesn't include the cost of lost land and lost tourism.

It just depresses me to no end that of all the Democrats, there is only one that is willing to stand up to Bush and Cheney and try to hold them accountable for what they have done.
