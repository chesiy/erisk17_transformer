You could also talk about your experience dealing with a difficult school subject, describing your problem area(s) and how you overcame it through receiving extra help from a tutor, or going out of your way to make sure you'd ace the material and you've learned how to stay motivated, not to give up, etc. Hope that helps.

Was the Canadian landmass ever experience a tropical climate zone?   My sister believes that at some point Canada had a climate similar to one at the equator, before the Ice Age. I know that Canada has sub-tropical and arctic climates but I can't find any information to refute her.   Is it possible that at some point in history northern part of North America had a desert or rainforest climate?
What are some websites that are similar to Pirate Bay?
