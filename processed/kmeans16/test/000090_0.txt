Thank you!

Don't care, I still like seeing it. I wanted to make a pair of spacers for my ears until I saw how much that shit ran for..
Good to know. I was being indecisive over the omega and pstriot rda's. If you have a chance, grab a nimbus, drill it out and replace the screws. The well isn't super deep but it seems to work really well with a .65ohm dual coil setup for clpud chasing
How are the omega and patriot clones? I have a nemesis with a nimbus clone that I widened the air holes that works great. Got em both from slowtech.
So. Amazing.
Hashtag bloodmoney?

This motherfucker better make it back to the front page to remind op of how much of a douche he is!
I'm not saying this is physically or feasibly possibly but, it is a great concept. An open source phone with interchangeable parts, like a desktop computer, sounds like a dream.
House of Pies in Houston, Tx?
I work in at a dueling piano bar and I usually miss everything that happens there. But on this night I got to see two sets of tits. One from a girl who wanted free drinks from me (she didn't get it this isn't r/gonewild ) and the other because some dude convinced her that it was a good idea to show the bartenders her boobs before they take a shot as some sort of "good luck" act. Either both were nice and made my night!
