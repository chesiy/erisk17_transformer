Comedies with quick, witty dialogue?   I just watched Alan Partridge and absolutely loved it. That dry, quick humor that's constant in the movie is my favorite. I watched The Trip as a follow up, and it was moderately funny, but not constant enough to have me dying like Partridge did.  Other movies with the kind of humor I'm looking for are In the Loop, Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Rushmore, In Bruges, The Guard, etc.   Any suggestions?
Just thinking about it gives me chills.  "Not many people in California have basements."  "I do."
It looks great except for the inside of the mouth. The crest of the tongue is too defined and makes it look like he has two big squirrel teeth or something.
I only watch Table Talks at this point, and only ones with casts I like. I save em up and listen to several in a row in podcast format.   The other news videos just seem redundant to me and I don't care about any of the nerd stuff, and the cheesy format is off-putting to me.   Oh well, I don't care enough to unsub or anything, but I only watch probably 10% of what they put out compared to the 90% or so that I used to watch with the original bunch.
WHY
I figured I get hate for this. He is a great actor, but recently I watched The Way, Way Back and I couldn't take him seriously at all. Especially if he puts on a weird voice behind some makeup. Knowing Miller I'll probably still love this movie, but damn if it doesn't seem like it might be hard.

The Grand Budapest Hotel - Museum Scene
Well, fuck.
Just fucking get Mark Strong. He plays a great, stone-cold badass and he's already got the perfect look.  http://1serial.tv/uploads/posts/2014-02/1393572396_7.jpg
I got super high with Bill Murray today. (x-post /r/pics)
Why the hair?
DOES IT HAVE TO BE IN CALIFORNIA?  edit: I didn't mean to do that in all caps but I'm happy with how it turned out
Oh yeah.
Can someone link to me to the album instead if this picture of Adele flipping the bird?
Yeah I know. I thought that a funny 5 second clip out of context would be appropriate though.
25th Hour
That's fucking bullshit. That's Chic-Fil-A and you fucking know it, don't you?
If you are in for a longer ride and have Netflix, watch the BBC series "Luther" starring Idris Elba. Judging by the movies listed, we have similiar taste. I promise it wont let you down. It's incredibly well acted, written, and directed, and has some amazing cases and killers. The last two episodes of season two were up there with Se7en and Prisoners. Really good stuff.
SHUT SHUT SHUT SHUT
Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Robert Ford  Inglorious Basterds  Se7en  Fight Club  Burn After Reading  Snatch  Twelve Monkeys  True Romance  Benjamin Button    Well shit. Looking back at it the guy has an amazing track record.

That's not a real subreddit, silly.
On the other hand, I met Macklemore in the NBA store in NYC two or three days ago. Dude seemed really sad and didn't say a word as I asked for a picture. Made me feel like a bit of an asshole for asking although I've been a huge fan for a while. He was all alone and looked tired as shit.
Thanks. I got that. I mean note wise.
Same here. Here's a few I took.  http://imgur.com/a/O9etA
Holy shit. That's amazing.
What's your favorite movie?
