My guess is similar to the new Model S, with maybe a tenth saved off in 0-60 rush and .5 sec shaved off in the quarter. I'd be shocked if the car can pull more then 125mph in the quarter mile and do well on a track unless Tesla invest a lot into cooling.     Frankly I'd be impressed if the car can run comparable to a 911 turbo on a track, and I'm confident that it will be far off future hyper cars that will be out by then.
Monsanto has never sued a farmer over accidental cross pollination, this is merely a common myth.     [Also the seed provided to Haiti was conventional non-GMO seed and were provided free to Haiti in response to a recent earthquake.](http://monsantoblog.com/2010/05/20/five-answers-monsanto-haiti/)
There's a lot of evidence that runs contradictory to the IARCs opinion on their classification. It isn't really that surprising that Monsanto would want to seek out an independent review.     [WHO safety analysis of glyphosate based off of many animal studies.](http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2006/9241665203_eng.pdf)         [Evaluation of carcinogenic potential of the herbicide glyphosate, drawing on tumor incidence data from fourteen chronic/carcinogenicity rodent studies](http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/10408444.2014.1003423)    There was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect related toglyphosatetreatment. The lack of a plausible mechanism, along with published epidemiology studies, which fail to demonstrate clear, statistically significant, unbiased and non-confounded associations betweenglyphosateand cancer of any single etiology, and a compelling weight of evidence, support the conclusion thatglyphosatedoes not present concern with respect to carcinogenic potential in humans.   [Cancer Incidence among Glyphosate-Exposed Pesticide Applicators in the Agricultural Health Study](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3435746?uid=2 uid=4 sid=21104202186197)    Note that there was a weak but slight association with multiple myeloma that the authors suggest that further follow up is required. Also this was among applicators who inherently are exposed to significantly higher amounts of glyphosate than end product consumers.     Also a re-analysis of the AHS data failed to show the same link between glyphosate and multiple meyloma.      [Multiple Myeloma and Glyphosate Use: A Re-Analysis of US Agricultural Health Study (AHS) Data](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25635915)      [Epidemiologic studies of glyphosate and cancer: A review](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273230012000943)    To examine potential cancer risks in humans, we reviewed the epidemiologic literature to evaluate whether exposure to glyphosate is associated causally with cancer risk in humans. We also reviewed relevant methodological and biomonitoring studies of glyphosate. Seven cohort studies and fourteen case-control studies examined the association between glyphosate and one or more cancer outcomes. Our review found no consistent pattern of positive associations indicating a causal relationship between total cancer (in adults or children) or any site-specific cancer and exposure to glyphosate.

Don't know why you are being downvoted, because you are right.    Our primary finding provides initial longitudinal evidence that cannabis use might elevate the risk of lung cancer. In light of the widespread use of marijuana, especially among adolescents and young adults, our study provides important data for informing the risk-benefit calculus of marijuana smoking in medical, public-health, and drug-policy settings.     -[Source](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23846283)       There were 79 cases of lung cancer and 324 controls. The risk of lung cancer increased 8% (95% CI 2% to 15%) for each joint-year of cannabis smoking, after adjustment for confounding variables including cigarette smoking, and 7% (95% CI 5% to 9%) for each pack-year of cigarette smoking, after adjustment for confounding variables including cannabis smoking. The highest tertile of cannabis use was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer RR=5.7 (95% CI 1.5 to 21.6), after adjustment for confounding variables including cigarette smoking.

And then there are GMO's that are made solely for the purpose of being resistant to pesticides     There are also non-GMO crops that have been made to be resistant to herbicides such as BASF Clearfield line.

Honestly not sure, but the Core-M has similar [performance to the i5 version](http://www.anandtech.com/show/9219/the-surface-3-review/5). If you are willing to wait I would wait, but you won't go wrong with getting a SP3.

Sanders has no chance against someone like Hilary, just look at the polls.
Again, my issue is with the use of it as a medical drug without the proper testing   studies.     I'm ambivalent to its legalization and support removing it from its current DEA schedule 1 status. I'm against using it to treat disease and illness when there is no strong evidence supporting its efficacy.
Quite a few people that go graduate with insane debt and no job prospects    No shit, one should have an understanding of their markets demand for their major before going into college. But the fact is simple, on average having a college degree [800k over just a high school degree.](http://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2014/may/is-college-worth-it-education-tuition-wages/)    Welders happen to make some decent money.

I have no idea where you are getting this 60/hr figure from, but a repair tech for John Deere is looking closer to $15 dollars out the gate.
