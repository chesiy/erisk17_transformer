Fuck, I just made a big comment describing this scene before I found that you already replied with the link.
Thank you, friend.
Did "./relaymyhome full" from there and got this http://i.imgur.com/p2h7oP4.png  I'm assuming everything went well and all I need to do is to connect my Macbook Pro w/Retina Display to a LAN Cable which is also connected to my Router while my N3DS is in sleep-mode and I will receive Eon Ticket via Street Pass? :D   ALSO btw, why does Homepass keep turning my Wi-Fi on and off?  EDIT: Going to sleep now. Will reply when I wake up. very tired. I appreciate your help so much. You didn't have to do this. Thank you for everything /u/sirence9
Wow, that was really obvious. Thank you very much for pointing it out for me, I would've never gotten it. I was trying to look for something deeper lol
Well... for reference Cisco even pointed out the **brighter red** on the Future Flash costume along with the white emblem in the newspaper from Well's secret room. I can pull a quote from the episode if you would like.  And EDIT: I did screen that myself.
Dude, I was referring to Future Barry in comparison to the main Barry. It's obvious the suit has remained the same shade of red, however there's no dying how bright red Future Barry's suit was in the finale compared to main Barry. Don't downvote me for that.
you should of made one of the going home rides into a mini date maybe like lets stop for a drink, food something.   I did, but she said she doesn't eat past 7 because of cutting weight. Went through a drive-thru to get us some drinks though. At several points I did want to kiss her and I felt like it would've been perfect but I didn't want it to be so soon since I've literally started talking to her for like two days.  Didn't feel like I was overtexting her, but the conversation definitely ended short.  I'm seeing her again tonight when I pick up her up for class, should I mention/bring up that text convo from last night? Also, how would you suggest I "fix" this?
What the fuck.
Good reply.
Don't act like the stereotype about the correlation between black people and crimes isn't remotely true, though. Let's be real, there's some shitheads in every ethnical group and culture but there's obviously a prominent amount of amongst Blacks than in others in comparison. Largely attributed to their history of growing up in poverty and in the ghetto and what not but that's still not a good excuse to be a shithead.  Sorry if I offended anyone unintentionally.
Why is there limited punching in Traditional Martial Arts?   Even styles that incorporate head punches (EX: ITF TKD) limit themselves in what kind of punches they do and how frequently they practice. Many of those fighters don't ever even learn proper punching mechanics. And by TMA's I mean styles such as variations of Karate and Taekwondo.  In many styles of Karate, the only punch that is practiced against a resisting opponent is the reverse punch which is the only punch that actually scores in Taekwondo.  Punching techniques are ridiculously limited when compared to styles such as Western Boxing, Muay Thai, or American Kickboxing.  Watching /u/LawrenceKenshin's videos of Karate   TKD practitioners enter Kickboxing-esque competition really shows how flawed and porous their punching technique is.   Obviously, this does not apply to every practitioner but it seems like the majority of them out there have very bad punching.   tl;dr: Is there a reason that many TMA's put much more emphasis on kicks than punches?
I think that the only reason I will watch this show is because Kara is really cute.  [NSFW] [She looks cuter when she's about to get fucked.](http://thefappening.so/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Melissa-Benoist-Naked-02.jpg)
No, not Core-ah; Care-ah.
Thank you.   That said though, I've found that WTF footwork gave me great ability to get in and other, but poor lateral movement.   - It's a common beginner tactic to slide back and forward rather than use angles.  For the more experienced fighters at my Dojang, we emphasize angles.  Most Taekwondo kicks travel down a linear line in order to reach their target so angling out at the same time as someone is about to chamber off-sets their attack and gives you time to counter-attack while they have to re-orient or reposition themselves.  Angles are quite common in higher belts but just back and forth motion is very common amongst lower belts.  We definitely practice lateral movement with ladder drills.  Ladder Drills are a staple of Taekwondo footwork training.    I've heard that this is less of a problem now because of electronic scoring being able to register the impact of a lead leg side kick and thus score it properly. Is that right?    - The Side Kick is one of the most powerful kicks in all of Taekwondo, in my opinion.  However, it's hard to score on someone's Hogu or eHogu (The Chest Guard) with a Side-Kick because of the side-on stance that Taekwondo Fighters adopt.  That said, we use front-leg side kicks very often at my Dojang as a "cut kick" or an attack that intercepts someone's forward movement and keeps them at range.  The Side Kick is the longest weapon in a TKD Fighter's arsenal.  Also, practicing proper technique for the Side Kick translates into the thrusting motion at the end of a Spinning Back Kick which is very often used to counter an opponent's Roundhouse Kick.  So to answer your question - it depends on the fighter and how they train.  I've sparred with opponents that consistently rely on their straight-line side kick and I've sparred with opponents that seldom use it or never use it at all.  Haven't seen a decreasing trend in it's usage though.  But, it's important to note that I've noticed a lot of fighters don't score on the Hogu with it.  Like I said, they use it to cram or push an opponent's ongoing attack or they'll score with a high side kick to the head.  EDIT: Hopefully I answered your question somewhat.
[Spoilers] Why wasn't "All Star Team-Up" what it was previewed to be in the Trailers?   With the Arrow and Firestorm showing up and all that.  The trailer under the title "All Star Team-Up" showed all that.  I was really looking forward to seeing a battle against the Reverse Flash this episode - I even skipped out on a couple other things tonight just so I wouldn't miss it because I couldn't wait.  Not complaining, tonight's episode was cool but definitely not what I was hyped up for.
Who is Bruce Lee?   Hi everyone, I'm test_subject387.  I lurk around a lot in this sub   I've made some posts every now and then.   In one of my threads many people went over an argument over a hypothetical situation regarding how well Bruce Lee would do in a fight versus a modern day fighter. I might get a lot of hate for this but there were a lot of misconceptions on both sides and I just wanted to express my opinion on them. I'd be grateful if you took the time to read before expressing your opinion.  And while I'm a HUGE Bruce Lee fan, this **is not** a "why Bruce Lee is the Greatest Martial Artist of All Time" post so I tried to keep everything closer to facts rather than opinion.  **Who is Bruce Lee?**   Bruce Lee is one of, if not *the*, most well-known martial artists of all time. He is famous for his short film career which left a global impact on the world, especially with *Enter the Dragon* being the first Hollywood produced Kung-Fu flick.   **So, he's just an action star?**   Aside from being a kickass movie star, Bruce Lee was a father, a husband, a dancer, and a life-long martial artist - being the founder of his own hybrid-martial art, Jeet Kune Do.  Bruce's philosophy on the martial arts for his time were considered radical. The notion of breaking out of what he considered "set styles" in order to become a complete martial artist through means of cross-training by taking what is useful   rejecting what isn't was revolutionary.  As a side note, Dana White, the President of the UFC, credits Bruce as being the "Godfather of Mixed Martial Arts."  What was unique about Bruce was that he studied various styles of martial arts, starting with Wing Chun and expanding onto Western Boxing, Jiujitsu, Savate, Judo and more. He used his knowledge to create, in his own vision, the most practical   efficient method of self-defense for street-fighting scenarios.  The hybrid martial arts style   philosophy of *Jeet Kune Do* is his legacy.  His books, "The Tao of Jeet Kune Do," "The Art of Expressing the Human Body,"   "Bruce Lee's Fighting Method" illustrated his training methods and personal fitness routine.  Bruce's ideologies on weight training and exercise focused on making his body as functional as possible for fighting - keeping himself light, flexible,   strong in order to hit fast and hard.  His personal method of fighting focused on economy of movement, for example, he favors the lead leg, southpaw stance because, in his opinion, Bruce believed that the strongest side should be the side you put forward.  The Jab, whether it be in the form of a kick or punch, is the shortest distance between you   your opponent and therefore, it should be used with your strongest side forward.  Everything should be efficient, he believed.   His his own words, the best definition of his own interpretation of efficiency in fighting would be a glass of water.   *"Water is the softest substance in the world, yet it can penetrate the hardest rock.  Water is also insubstantial. By that I mean you cannot grasp hold of it, you cannot punch it and hurt it."*  *"Be formless. Shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend."*  tl;dr: A fighter must be fluid, ready to adapt to any opponent.   **So you're saying the guy was a fighter? Prove it. There's no professional record of him in existence.**   I want to make it clear.  It is *obvious* that Bruce Lee was no professional fighter.  Aside from winning a High School Boxing Tournament while in Hong Kong and various alleged streetfights, there is no existing fighting record regarding Bruce Lee.  Also, other than demonstration footage and low quality training footage, there is not very much visual evidence to cite his level of skill.    However, the man trained his entire life to be the most efficient fighter he can possibly be - always reaching to surpass his limits.  As Linda Lee stated in the documentary, *"I Am Bruce Lee,"* Bruce would always play flipped footage of Muhammed Ali (because Lee is a Southpaw) and analyze his movements hoping to fight him one day.  While it sounds ridiculous to compare Lee to professional champions past   present, it just goes to show that Lee would have taken any challenge thrown at him.  The man was not afraid to prove himself.  So was he a professional fighter?  Not by any means but does this mean he wasn't a fighter?  I'll leave it up to you with this analogy: If you practice martial arts but never compete, are you still considered a fighter?  **How do you think Bruce Lee would do in the Modern MMA world?**  Bruce Lee was a complete martial artist.  He studied various styles of striking along with grappling as evidenced in his illustrations and notes printed in *"The Tao of Jeet Kune Do."* Bruce's philosophies of taking what is useful   rejecting what isn't when regarding cross-training is the underlying definition of what MMA is.  However, MMA is a sport that has evolved through hundreds of bouts.  In order to be a good MMA Fighter, one must train under the rulesets of the sport to maximize what they can do in the cage.  Simply put, while having trained in and mixed various styles of martial arts, Bruce Lee is not an "MMA" Fighter.  Modern Mixed Martial Arts is the epitome of how martial arts have evolved over time to the highest level suited for the cage and, as stated earlier, Bruce Lee wasn't training for that kind of environment.  It's still fun though to speculate how Bruce would've done against modern fighters in and out of his would-be weight division, but at the end of the day, Bruce wasn't training for a competition-style environment.   **You still haven't answered the question, would Bruce Lee do well in the UFC?**  In today's UFC roster with the skills   knowledge he had before his death? Probably not. The sport has evolved into a mix of striking and grappling suited for the rules of the cage.  However, it would've been interesting to see how he would've done in the early UFC Tournaments where it was still style v. style.  In my opinion, Bruce's diverse arsenal of techniques would've taken him far in those early tournaments.   **In Conclusion?**   Bruce Lee isn't some sort of unbeatable God of a fighter or anything along those lines nor did he claim himself to be.  He was, however, a highly-respected martial artist that was ahead of his time, the founder of Jeet Kune Do, an international movie star, and a family man.  **Anything else?**  I wanted to repost an old comment of mine from /r/mma where there was a argument that Bruce was just an actor and nothing else.  While it repeats some of the things I've stated above, it also goes into detail on some of the topics I touched on.  It has to do a lot with Bruce's *actual fighting style* as opposed to what we've seen on-screen in the movies.  Regarding that subject here is my personal opinion on it:  A lot of people on /r/MMA will claim that Bruce Lee was an actor and nothing else, which is inaccurate. Bruce, before anything else, was a Martial Artist. The techniques and philosophies that he trained in and preached were definitely revolutionary for his time. The ideas of taking what is useful and rejecting what isn't, how styles are a crystallization, and to be a complete martial artist - one must cover all their bases were ingenious and are what Modern MMA Fighters apply today. A lot of people will say Bruce was a flashy fighter, but what they don't realize is his on-screen style is completely different from what he preaches for fighting. He just knew what would look nice on camera, and obviously what looks nice on camera may be less than applicable in real, live fighting. Bruce's fighting style emphasized economy of movement. His books, "The Tao of Jeet Kune Do" and "Bruce Lee's Fighting Method," which explains his ideas regarding fighting, are very scientific. His concepts were very unique, for example, he puts his strong side forward instead of back because he believes that the lead leg and the lead hand should be your strongest side for it covers the least amount of distance required to reach your opponent. A "signature" move in a lot of his movies is the Spinning Heel Kick, AKA "Dragon Whips His Tail." However, in his book, "Bruce Lee's Fighting Method," he claims that the technique is too high risk in order to rely on and favors the Turning Back Kick when regarding kicks. The Turning Back Kick is now a common move taught in Muay Thai striking for MMA Fighters and many fighters have utilized it in their fighting career. It really shows how he favors realism, applicability, and practicality over flashy theatrics when it comes to real fighting. Not to say flashy moves do not work, we've seen plenty of instances where "spinning shit" ends in knockouts, but they're risky moves and Bruce favored what was more reliable. What's ironic is Bruce actually preferred low kicks to high kicks because they're easier to land and you have more targets: the kneecap, the groin, the solar plexus, the liver, etc. Also, regarding grappling which is a staple of MMA, Bruce's book shows that he had researched Judo and Jiu-Jitsu and the illustrations in the book portray various submissions such as chokeholds and armbars along with throws.
