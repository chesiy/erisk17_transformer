That after his death his online accounts will be anonymously usurped and his reputation ruined.
This Twigsy guy really knows his craft. I've got to respect that on some level.
You vaguely remind me of my creepy-ass, late brother-in-law.
Thanks a lot, yaar :)
Thank you.
Thank you very much. The response has been more than I could have imagined, and I'm thankful that Diane continues to inspire joy and love, even after her passing.
Mujhe apni patni ki yada a raha hai apna khayal rakhna, dost. maf kijiye, mujhe Hindi nahee ati hai. mai U.S. se hum. My mom's from Delhi but my dad's from the South. We mostly spoke English at home. Apna Khyal Rakhna.
Yes it's my name (I don't normally give personal information, but I figured first names would be ok because I didn't expect many people to see this). I grew up in the U.S., but my parents are Indian. Take care.
Yes, we had played it, plus the left-overs and coffee were still out. That's how I know it wasn't a dream, and that I hadn't just woken up in bed and found her.   I just got back from a three week long trip with my brother where we stayed with my aunt and uncle. I've been surrounded by nothing but friends and family, which definitely helps.
She was decent. She enjoyed solving the tests, but to be honest I think she liked the story lines more. Sometimes she got frustrated and watch walk-throughs. She also liked to watch me play.
At first I did. I really really did. I sobbed for hours just thinking "why did I go in". I spent days on the couch wishing I could see her standing over me.   But ultimately, I don't think I can regret going in.   I know that Diane must have been a very pure soul to achieve something like that, almost pure enough to attain Moksha (in Hinduism, it's freedom from rebirth. An extremely perfect state. Its *way* better than rebirth, but it's hard for we who aren't very spiritually advanced yet to grasp).   I can't help that I wish I could see her again. But I also fear that her attachment to me could hinder her on her journey.  I'm sure that when she departed, she took birth in much better circumstances than in our house, worrying about me.
Thank you. I think I will. Eventually.
Please do. I'm happy for you and your wife, it's a comforting reminder that joy and love still exist out there, even if *I* am sort of on pause for a bit.   Please, forget trivial disagreements, realize the value in every moment and make as many pleasant memories together as you can.
Thank you. It happened little over a month ago. It took me some time to bring myself to write about it.   I've told a few people I'm close to. Most seemed sympathetic (or at least didn't verbalized their skepticism).
Holy shit. I'd definitely try to stay on Matt's good side, if I were you.
That is terrifying, do you have someone else you can stay with for a while? Dogs are a great alarm system and source of protection, please get one!
