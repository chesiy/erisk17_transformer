Definitely do not 'suck it up' until the fall. You need to be clear with him that he is still responsible for certain things.   With him making money (for now) and you doing the majority of the chores things seem pretty balanced from an outsider's perspective. But if either of you aren't happy with the arrangement then they aren't balanced.   You guys need to have a discussion and both lay out what the arrangement will be and if there is a discrepancy between your individual expectations then a compromise must be agreed upon.   That is the way you avoid resentment.   Honestly, if I were him I would be happy to only have to take out the trash.   Oh, and the dishes thing I feel like shouldn't even be negotiated. That's just a thing that adults do, they clear their fucking plates. C'mon guy, seriously.
Sorry that your boy's father is such a jerk.   The good news is you have your parents support, that's more than a lot of people get.   Focus on your pregnancy, have a happy, healthy baby. Take whatever steps you need to get his father to pay child support (he owes you that). Go back to school when you can. Your dating prospects may be a little bleak for the near future but that's ok, your son needs your focus now anyway.   You'll be ok.
We are getting divorced.   Maybe I wasn't clear in my post, but my desire for counseling was before I was in the hospital.   After she basically abandoned me and told me she 'couldn't support me' I was done with any thought of reconciliation.   I'm not trying nor do I have any desire to save the marriage. We are negotiating through our respective lawyers over details but are nearing a settlement.   My questions have to do with whether her actions would be considered cheating by anyone else. I feel like she did, she insists she didn't and her actions are justified. Am I crazy for feeling betrayed and cheated on?
What's killing me is that what I'm going through doesn't feel normal.  My wife doesn't give a shit about me anymore, she's not going through one of the toughest times in her life, she's already moved on.   And the fact that she can drop me this easily makes me feel absolutely worthless and doesn't really inspire any kind of confidence for my future.   I know even if I could meet someone right away that jumping into another relationship is a bad idea I just wish I had some hope that I could find one sometime in the future.
I used the one for the 360 and loved it.   I hadn't realized that they came out with one for the One.   That's getting shipped to me immediately.
I know how you feel.   My wife (of 9 years) wants out and all I want is to be able to fix things and have my best friend and partner back.   What's helped me feel (a tiny bit) better is being able to reflect clearly on our past and realize that she's never really been the partner I wanted/needed.   I don't know if that's the case for you or not but I totally understand your feelings about wishing things could go back.
Thanks!  I'll let you know.
I'm trying to put together a squad for Maxwell:  I have Zelnite and Darvanshel fully maxed and sphere frogged   I also have a maxed Tree and Grah  I'm planning on taking a Lilly Matah friend (after I find one, looking for friend thread, I know)  For my last spot I was thinking of training up the Rowgen I just pulled, will he work or should I be looking for someone else?  Also, what kind of spheres should I be using?  I have all the GGC ones (except Black Lance), one Medulla, 2 Sol Creators, Evil Shard, Providence Ring, and the Halloween Spheres (both).    I couldn't make the score for a Legwand last FH.
Request sent, IGN: Jaird  I'm active daily and an accurate gifter, lvl 109  Leaders: Zelnite, Elza, Lilly Matah
Accepted. Happy Hunting!

My Darvanshel is 6*, still working on getting SBB (BB is 8/10)  Just sent you a request
Thanks!  I guess I just wanted to hear that I'd get there eventually.  LoL  Still working on being able to take full advantage of FH and harder Dungeons.  I have decent units, I just need to get them leveled/BB'd/evolved.
