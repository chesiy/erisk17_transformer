Birdie.
The Crosstrek is a very cool ride. However, so is your '13 so be sure to enjoy it. Anyone who owns a Subaru is bound to have a blast regardless of the model!
This is so many levels of awesome.
I guess you wouldn't mind coming to Canada to help me out with my rims? I'll buy you a case of beer? lol
Want to be friends?
and?
SHAME
Yeah I feel you on this, I do love that god awful wing on the STi though so I would be sad not having one lol
STi is more expensive, although the WRX isn't an STi I think things like leather and push to start would be cool to have. Not to mention with the money saved I could still go crazy with all the cobb parts I want lol. Thanks for the input
I didn't even know that, thanks for sharing lol. Maybe the BAZ coming soon? ;)
I don't even know popular subaru forums to be honest lol (I'm in Canada)
Thanks for sharing, I'm in a similar situation. Big into gaming but have been wanting to get back into shape. I was 165 my whole life pretty much (I'm 6'0). Now I'm up to 212 and hate looking in the mirror. I got a fitbit and have discovered MFP which I've been using for the last 3 days or so. I've just been eating right and going for daily walks. I would like to get back into going to the gym to get a body like yourself but I have no idea where to start. What foods to eat, what exercises to do at the gym, do I write them down etc etc. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
Was also wondering, how much were the protective measures you took at the detail-er if you don't mind me asking?
glad you got it working :)
How is it restricting you? Pick any state and then google Zip codes for the state of whichever you have chosen.
Thanks for sharing, looks awesome :). Mine is your typical 4x4 :( lol
