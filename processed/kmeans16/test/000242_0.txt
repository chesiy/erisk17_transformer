Call me when:  A) you have kids  B) Your 8 year old boy is 100 miles away in the middle of the woods getting tucked into his tent by a homosexual man    Now that homosexuals can lead boy scouts, can a straight man lead girl scouts?  Why not?  This decision is utter nonsense.
Yes, the USA supplied Free Syrian Army factions with Tow missiles to fight Syrian forces.  Yes, the FSA now has the name ISIS in Western media.  They are the same force.  'In February 2015, The Carter Center listed 23 groups within the Southern Front of the Free Syrian Army that have been documented using US supplied TOWs.[23]'  Source:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BGM-71_TOW#2011_Syrian_Civil_War  Videos of your tax money in use by ISIS:  http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=481_1413038085  http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=a1b_1433864733  Edit: Would love to hear the Obama followers explain how American TOWs w/  scratched off serial numbers made it to Syria.
This article was about people attacking Christians for simple holding signs.  Feel free to comment on the article.  I'll leave you with a quote re: leftist violence.  "I want you to argue with them and get in their faces" -Barack Obama  Not exactly the words of tolerance.

"Several press reports surfaced Thursday saying Clintons department signed off on the sale of uranium rights in the U.S. to a Russian company, while the Clinton Foundation was receiving donations from that company. President Bill Clinton was also given a $500,000 speaking fee in Russia."  Outright corruption to anyone with common sense.  Head-turning and excuses from the liberal Reddit intelligentsia.
That's life. It's not fair.  When you stop blaming your problems on the "rich" bogeyman, you'll start sleeping better.  Take responsibility for your own situation.  No one else is holding you down.
It's her fault for not given you space. You are almost a man.
They're just so JV.
Iran will kill millions of innocent civilians when they obtain a nuclear weapon.  War will rage across the Middle East, Europe and possibly further.  But who cares?  We have a cool, mixed president and aren't racist and stuff.
Obama saying something else is Bush's fault?  When will he start leading? He is one who **provided ISIS with TOW missiles**.  Also, is there any **single one thing** that Obama likes about America?  This man is not fit to lead a kindergarten teeball team.  He should be put in handcuffs and removed from office.
Anthropomorphic global warming is a farce and a political movement to undermine Western capitalist nations.  Devastating periods of climate activity are going to happen, with or without humans present. Consider the ice ages. Glaciers several kilometers thick formed and moved thousands of miles, crushing everything in their paths. There is no scientist on earth that can tell you why this occurred.  There were several interglacial periods of warming, where ice was rapidly melting.   We are probably in one of those periods now.     Even the founder of Greenpeace stated before Congress there is no scientific evidence of anthropomorphic global warming.     Relax, the sky's not falling. We don't need more govt control to avert another fake crisis. Sound familiar?
"Hiding profits in tax havens is one of the most common ways large corporations avoid paying their fair share to the IRS."  You know what's not fair?  Working hard to get somewhere and having to provide free housing, Obama phones, food stamps, disability, education and health care to people who sit around and smoke weed all day.  Most low to medium income people don't understand this because they pay little, none or even negative tax.  Rewarding the unsuccessful and punishing the successful is an unsustainable economic proposition.
More gargling of Democrat semen by Reddit.   If a Democrat commits a crime, not a big deal.  The rule of law is not important here, just whims of the mob.
"Gov. Romney, I'm glad that you recognize that al-Qaida is a threat, because a few months ago when you were asked what's the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia, not al-Qaida. You said Russia ... the 1980s, they're now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because, you know, the Cold War's been over for 20 years," -Barack Hussein Obama  This is what happens when you put an amateur in the White House.
I'm sure his next speech will cover the epidemic of black-on-white murders, robberies and rapes in America.  No, he'll just worry about people's speech.
