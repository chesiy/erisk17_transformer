I was asking because when I am away at college, my PS4 is hooked up to a small TV as my dorm room doesn't have that much space, but in order to see it I'd have to be 8-10 feet away from the screen. Due to that, I barely touch my PS4 during the school year.  I was, basically, wondering whether or not people felt as though it was worthwhile for me to get it on the PC as well due to that fact. (If I'm on my laptop, I am a lot closer to the screen.)
~~Do you happen to know where I could buy the piano arrange album? (It isn't on the US iTunes like the rest of Key's stuff, same with the Million Star single album)~~  Dang it, it seems as though the album was only as a bonus for the first press of the Angel Beats VN. Here's to hoping that Sekai will license and release the game and include the album.
I'm not the guy who made the original, but [here is a much larger version of the image](http://i.imgur.com/5OcatP9.jpg). You could use this as a wallpaper.  I ran the original through the Waifu2x-caffe program and had it scale the image to 4x the original size. (This looks a lot better than other resizing algorithms as it is actually recreating the original image through the training of a neural network based on line art and things of that nature.)
I think the issue with "Blank" is that people try to use it in a rotation rather than as a situational skill.  There is a time and place for it such as in Copperbell where you have to keep the squiggans away from the bomb so that you can break apart the slime. Another place would be in ST during the Amon fight to keep the slimes away while being killed.
My guess they only have the ability to do X number of refunds an hour. Odds are so many people requested a refund on the first day that they are playing catch up. I've been waiting for a few days for a refund as well.
I figured as such. Invariably someone will take pictures and share them on here anyways so we might be able to see it.

I never said that you said it was empty. My reply was based off of your "You need to put stuff there for him [the player] to find." to which I pointed out some examples that I know of off the top of my head.
You don't have to grind at all. The developers made it clear to the player that they are to keep on moving and explore the world. If you want to stay in the Hinterlands, good and it would be a massive grind but you'd have so much "power" that the rest of the game that they designed the player to see would be trivial and glossed over.

The manga is really good but sadly isn't available officially in English. It switches between regular manga and 4-koma as the need arises which is nice as you get the benefits of both. The art is really good as well.   Source: I own the first volume in Japanese.
Considering the attribution along the top, probably none. I, originally, had this done and ready for people to use back on February 27th which was before these sites implemented his code. I didn't release it because I was unsure of what license he wanted the code to be released under. I released it now because it has been two and a half weeks since the last post from him and I am unsure if, or when, I will even hear back.  If that site is working for you, then great!   The only reason people would want to use this code/program is if they wanted something that they could easily open rather than remembering to go to those types of sites.
It might be the surprise hit, but there is a lot of contention this coming season for AOTS: (Note that I am listing the big name ones, not what I feel as though could be AOTS)  * Disappearance of Nagato Yuki - (aka More Haruhi and it has the original voice cast)  * Fate/Stay Night - Unlimited Blade Works S2  * Gintama  * High School DxD BorN - (While it is an ecchi series, it has been hyped up quite a bit)  * Hibike! Euphonium - (KyoAni doing a music show)  * Hello! Kiniro Mosaic  * Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha Vivid - (While it isn't popular on here, the series is well received and has a lot of fans)  * Nisekoi S2  * Knights of Sinonia S2  * Shokugeki no Souma - (Well received manga)  * Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru Zoku - (aka Yahari S2)  * Yamada-lun to Nananin no Majo - (Manga is well received and people like the characters)
As a heads up, you are requesting not suggesting an anime.   Suggesting on here is, basically, the same as /r/manga's "Read This!" or /r/anime's "Watch This!" tag.  I have changed your tag and approved your post.  ---  On another, note you might want to look at either getting an account on an anime tracking website such as MyAnimeList (MAL) or Hummingbird. This will help people see what you have already seen and scored and give you shows to watch accordingly.
Part of the reason why there is a difference between the screaming voices is that it is really easy for English speakers to pollute their vowels when sustaining a word.   In Japanese they only have a single vowel sound for each vowel and as such it is a lot harder for the vowel to be polluted.  For an example of a polluted vowel, try singing anything that ends in -ing and try to hold the -ing. It gets polluted. With the word "trying" try singing it as "tryic" and hold the "i" vowel then add -ng at the lat moment.  Source: I am in choir and we have to deal with this sort of thing.
I was in Japan for two weeks and no one else from my group was around to go eat and it was after most places had closed. (8pm!) I walked down a nearby street to find somewhere to eat and tried/worked it out so I could oder some food and I ate alone.   Either that or the time when no one else around so I walked to Akihabara by myself to explore. I, barely, knew the language but thankfully I didn't have to speak to anyone.
If you are in the US and you are 18 or older, you ought to sign up for Mturk.   It is run by Amazon and you can get Amazon Gift Cards by buying it through what you earn from Mturk.   Personally, I've made about $1000 over three years of off and on work. There are times where I'll forget about it for spans of 3-4 months as college gets busy and I have to focus on that.  ---  Some information from the sticky:  **[Amazon Mechanical Turk](http://www.mturk.com)** [US ~AND CANADA~]  This site is a bit different from your typical beer money site. This is a bit more professional. You work for "requesters" and they approve or reject your submitted content called "hits." Many people here think this great and it often gets them more money than other sites. They do require more personal info from you than the sites above for tax reasons (even though you likely won't have to worry about it) and not everyone gets approved to work here.   gt;   Age minimum: 18   gt; Offers: Different tasks requesters want you to do for money   gt; Payout: Amazon Payments balance or bank account   gt; Referral Incentive: None   gt; TIPS   gt;  Dont use mturk without having [turkopticon](http://microwork-dev.ucsd.edu/) installed. Its a browser add-on that allows workers to post reviews about requesters and gives you a good idea of whether or not to attempt a HIT based on the requesters reputation.   gt;  Only do hits that pay at least 10/minute. Mturk grind forum and /r/hitsworthturkingfor are good places to check for worthy hits.   gt;  It is better to return a hit (it will not negatively impact you) than submit if you are unsure whether the requester will approve it.
You had the wrong flair for you are asking/*requesting* shows, you need to use the "Request" flair.  I have changed it for you this time, but please remember to flair correctly in the future.
Good grief.
It is a combination of the video ads, the ads on the side and the ones that pop up during the video on the bottom. Someone who is monetized can set which of these ads are shown or all of them.  It is and isn't on views. You are insunating that it is determined by someone watching the video, but even going on the page and having it up will cause an "impression". (aka ad view)  Google has been in the advertising business for years so it is near impossible to exploit and if you do your account will be frozen and you will no longer be monetized. (Youtube uses Google's AdSense platform for ads)
* Sakurasou - Eh... * Toradora - Not until later in the season * Kokoro Connect - This fits. * Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun - She is. He has no idea. * Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou - Doesn't fit what OP is looking for * Kaichou wa Maid-sama - The lead MC is too tsundere and doesn't fit what OP is looking for.
The one thing I really like about the recent posts by /u/Shadoxfix's bot, which uses his account, is that he includes the link to where you can legally watch it.   I think there was something wrong with the bot so I copied the source from the episode 2 post, added the link to the second episode discussion and submitted it.
Better yet, when/if the kickstarter meets or exceeds its goal in November, the game will be released in English! (Sekai Project is even trying to get it on Steam but that one would be the all ages version. No idea how it is going to be all-ages without some of the scenes, but Frontwing [the developer] has a Vita version out which is all-ages.)  [Here is some more information about the Kickstarter right from Sekai Project.](http://prefundia.com/projects/view/lets-bring-the-grisaia-trilogy-to-the-west/2814/)
**Please do not mention illegal streaming/downloading sites.**
So far, there aren't any official sources for watching this show. To answer your question would be to break the rules. Try google searching for episode one since it is "out" and subbed somewhere.  Hint: Watch for /u/Shadowfix 's bot to post the discussion thread for it. It also looks the sites that people put fansubs on.
I would suggest reading the light novels. You can find them on the usual site. (It says "preview" but it is the full book.)   The LNs are a lot better than what the anime is making it out to be. While the fan service scenes are there they are fairly short and only really happen once or twice a volume. (224 pages or so.) They are also brought up again later so they serve an actual purpose.
Thank you for reminding people to use the correct flair. I've changed it for OP.
Looking to upgrade from ATH-M50   I have been using the ATH-M50 headphones for about a year and a half now, but even since getting a DAC (The Audioengine D1) I've realized that there is more to hear that these headphones cannot fully reproduce. What would be a good headphone to go to from here?  **Budget:** Max of $400.00 (Though if there is something that is slightly above that amount it should be fine.)  **Usage:** I plan on using them on my computer to watch videos and listen to music. I am in a dorm so some isolation would be good and I have to travel to home on breaks.  **What do I listen to?** - I listen to anything from Jazz to Rock (Not Metal) to Classical. (I do not listen to R B or Rap)  I am looking for headphones that can accurately reproduce the recorded sound rather than adding in extra bass.
[SPOILERS] Little Busters! Episode 6 Discussion   Wow, I was not expecting that reaction at the end of the episode from Komari. I liked the touch where the flashback at the end was mainly instrumental with only the phrase spoken by her brother as "This was all a dream".  What are your thoughts on this episode?
