Harry Potter series.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ENJOYING THE POST. I JUST CHECKED YOU OUT AND FOUND OUT THAT YOU HAVEN'T BEEN AROUND REDDIT FOR A LONG WHILE (ATLEAST DIDN'T MAKE ANY POSTS OR COMMENTS) ASSUMING YOU'RE NEW TO [/R/ALLCAPSMOTIVATION](http://www.reddit.com/r/allcapsmotivation/), I WOULD JUST LIKE TO LET YOU KNOW THAT LOWERCASES ARE NOT SOMETHING WE APPRECIATE AROUND THIS SUB.. (I WAS GENTLE WHILE WRITING THAT, ACTUALLY WE FUCKING ABHOR, LOATHE, AND HATE THE GODDAMN LOWERCASE LETTERS WITH ALL OF OUR FUCKING HEARTS.)  AND APPARENTLY YOU'RE AN ASPIRING WRITER (IF I'M NOT WRONG). DO SHARE SOME OF YOUR WORKS HERE IF YOU THINK THEY ARE RELATED TO WHAT THIS SUB STANDS FOR. IF NOT YOU CAN PM ME THE LINKS. I'M AN ASPIRING WRITER TOO SO I WOULD TRY TO READ THEM. ALL THE BEST FOR YOUR WRITING.)  GO KICK-ASS.
Thank you so much for the response :)
That's a very interesting one.. Thank you buddy :)
I found the first-person perspective gave a fascinating insight into the main character's mind as his situation worsened.  Stephen King rocks at such stuff... Thanks. I will pick it up..
oh that's a very good advice.. thanks :)

Yeah like many comments said.. the idea is good.. but the execution of course matters... And also that human relations thing is true to its core.. I mean, look at **Interstellar** film.. it wouldn't have been what it is if the humanitarian aspects are not embellished into the plot.. look at that Docking Scene.. You want to save a planet full of people, and live for the your loved ones.. else you would just listen to the robot and not try anything, right!
YES I DID... BUT TIME AND AGAIN COMING BACK HERE TO HELP OTHERS BY TELLING WHAT GOOD STUFF YOU'RE DOING IN YOUR LIFE WOULD BE OF A KICK FOR ALL. I'M NOT ASKING YOU WASTE TIME ON THE INTERNET, BUT JUST ASKING TO KEEP THIS MOTIVATING SUB OF OURS ALIVE.. IF YOU THINK THAT IS A TIME WASTE, THEN YES PLEASE GO AHEAD WITH WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING IN REAL LIFE WITHOUT WASTING TIME ON THE INTERNET.   NO HARD FEELINGS, BROTHER!  ALL THE GODDAMN BEST FOR WHATEVER YOU'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE IN YOUR LIFE :)
The idea of your book is really interesting to me... Especailly the prot realizing that he doesn't know anything.. Greetings for coming up with something like that .. And all the very best for it get good publishers.. and when it happens do plz message me a link where I can buy it.. Amazon probably.. I'm from India. I would like to read your book, pal, assuming that it's not very very long ;-)   Thanks :)
Oh, brother, you just inferred a lot of brilliant but unnecessary shit which the quote doesn't even seem to imply.. I'm sorry that it hurt your feelings.. What you said about those countries and cultures might be true, I don't know.. That quote doesn't even in the least bit tell anything about non-readers.. I just posted this quote solely because it appeals to book readers.. I would do the same even if that quote came from goddamn Bermuda Triangle!
I will just critique like a reader himself who can also write. I'm not a native English speaker, I'm from India:  * In the opening line, the word 'exactly' being used multiple times slightly made the sentence a bit pretentious. Try changing that, if you can.   He had huge hands, so long that if it stretched it, it would go through the walls and..   I think it should be "He had huge hands, so long that if he (you just mentioned the monster as a He) stretched them (plural, *hands* - right) they would go (plural again.)   So thats why it sat on its toes,  Hmm, fine. But maybe sitting on its (or his, I'm not sure. its is fine though) knees would do better, I guess.   It was just sitting there staring at me, **with its eyes**,  I don't think that emphasizing that it is staring at you with its eyes is necessary. Everything in the universe looks with its eyes only, no!   They looked like ordinary human eyes except they were extremely yellow, and instead of a pupils it had a lightings, opening a persons mind into another world, most people called it a nightmare, but to me it was a dreamland.  Good and important sentence, but first of all it's too long, without easy readability and also grammatical errors. Singular - Plural mostly ('a pupils', 'a lighting's' - just pupils - no a, 'a' makes it singular; same for lightings - no a and also no apostrophe, I guess). But I would say instead of 'lightings' find a better word. May be *sparks.*   Most children at that age liked to go to the  Most children at *my* age  - would've done better, because a moment later you're bringing that point onto you, saying that you like staring at it rather. So, this seemed better.    So I told my mother, she embraced me, and told me that monsters dont exist.  Embraced is not establishing your point here. You can expand this point. Because it's an important one. It is showing that he was not believed by people. So, this can be better I guess: "So, I told my mother. She looked back at me with a calm and unsurprised but an understanding look in her eyes. She took me close and hugged me, and said that monsters dont exist."  I don't know if you like my description but it I'm trying to tell you that this is an important moment in the story and so finishing it so justly wouldn't do good.   refusing to neither eat nor drink anything until I saw the monster again.  It's *either - or*. Because you already said *refusing* which is a negative, and *neither - nor* is again a negative. No double negatives.   As a kind hearted mother she couldnt bare it, she refuse to believe me.  It's bear - not bare. And refused.   Ended the story well. Overall, I liked the story. It's very good. I like such fantastic and mystic incidents put into words. And coming to your writing. I sense that English is not your native language. It's not mine too, like I mentioned at the beginning. So, you have some grammatical errors. Needed correcting. But after the sentence "As a kind hearted mother she couldnt bare it, she refuse to believe me." Everything went too fast. Situations aren't established well. Maybe you can take a second look on that.  overall it's a 7/10 for the storyline. English is to be improved grammatically.  But I'm having a feeling that you're going to do a lot better in the coming days. In some ways, I see myself in you. I see my own writing in yours. We can all improve and we should -  we will.  All the very best... And once again, Good story.. keep it up :)    [And hey, now a quick tip about posting in this Sub. Do select a **flair** for your story, like a genre. Yours can be *Fantasy*, I guess. And also critique others' stories. Else they put you into Leeching (they already did, which is why I'm telling this. Normally leeched posts are ignored by members here.) which means you're a freeloader over here, taking critiques but never giving them back to others. I faced it last week. You please don't. You wrote a good story.]
Hey thank you so much for the feedback.. It is very helpful and surely didn't hurt a bit, because my main focus, as far as my "Writing" life is concerned, is not on poetry, it's basically on *fiction.* This poetry pieces are just a trail to drench my thirst, just to see if I can writing nice sounding and rhyming stuff. That's all. Apparently, I couldn't.  Anyways, talking of poetry, let me confess, I tried reading epic poetry like *Paradise Lost*, but truth be told, I never *understand* anything in those epic poetic lines, but then sometimes among them I used to find some really awesome powerful *quotes* kind-of lines, which made me keep going if only for searching more of such lines..   Why I'm telling you all this is because you really seem to have great knowledge on poetry related works (you even mentioned that your academics are related to this field). So I want to ask you for help.   Please help me with an explanation on how to read epic poetry?? I mean, I literally Googled for a verse/prose translation of Paradise Lost. *How freaking weird is that* - to search for the English prose translation for a work already originally written in English itself! I mean, come on, what kind of idiot does such a thing.. I did it. Because I was unable to figure out even a single sentence clearly..   Now, tell me what am I supposed to do about all this?? I really want to read great epic poetry, like Paradise Lost, Divine Comedy, The Aeneid, Beowulf and etc..!! HELP.  **Note**: English is not my first language, I'm from India.
Something!
