I don't want to be here anymore, and apparently others don't want me either.   The person I most looked to in the world has told me they're better off without me, as most people do when they speak to me over time. I don't fit into the world, I don't have a place, and I just make people angry and hate me. I'd make the world better by simply not existing. What am I supposed to do, make people suffer my presence? It doesn't seem right.
May I ask, why the unsatisfaction?
No, its not, its spelled YetiiWho92  Edit: ah, my apologies, reflexes
Very impressive sir, I like it :p, thank you :D
i just preferred if the map makers did their own lore for the map they made, rightfully so. And you're welcome, i did my best! :P
http://i.imgur.com/08jRwgO.png feel free to just draw these two doing anything, could even make it sci-fi related! although them in a campsite with a tent, a fire, and a log to sit on would be nice
THAT. IS. PERFECT. I love it :D:D:D:D:D
Dwarves vs. Zombies observed changes 2/1/14   So, as you may know, DvZ is still a WIP, as heroes are not finished, sounds still need to be added, and new maps are still needed. However, there was another "balancement" update rather than "content" update today, and these are the changes I observed:  * Procs are now limited to within 5 blocks of your person, so basically, **bow proccing is removed.** * Golems are readded, ~~however, spawn with only a seppuku, so they do not have much of a function other than a walking damage soaker.~~ **They now spawn once again with the ancient pick.** * **Healing ale now uses 150 mana** rather than 200 from before. * Mount Willakers has invulnerability added upon monster spawn (18 seconds). * As of this moment, ~~I did not see any instances of squid (maybe rarer?)~~, ~~wolves (also rarer?)~~, ~~or the map oasis (removed?)~~ ~~and have not played on any map other than Mt Willy to see if they have arrow invul too~~. * ~~WE GOT FANCY SPECIAL MONSTER MESSAGES, I LOVE YOU ALL.~~ **SPIDER KING MESSAGES ARE MESSED UP, PRAISE REDACTED.**  I myself enjoy these changes, it makes indoor combat easier, shields have more use outside, and spawn camping isn't devastating anymore, at least from what I observed.  As stated by nisovin below:   * **Sword damage was increased to 10** rather than 8 (~~**PALADINS, USE THE RUNEBLADE, THE HOLY BLADE IS NOT UPDATED**~~ Fixed.). * All map's invulnerability was increased (18 seconds). * Squids are, in fact, removed. * Oasis, is in fact, removed. * Holy Blades and Longbows are shiny again, keep in mind they **DO NOT** do anything extra, just shine.  In a speculation: (as per substitutemyown): An event, rather it be randomly occurring (most likely this, as if it were a special monster event almost) or admin controlled, that occurs during the day known as the Solar Eclipse will block out the sun, and cause havoc among the dwarves, as the zombies regain their buff.  Side note, I would gladly make more of these if people want, it's kinda fun, always pondered the idea of a constantly changing guide, maybe one day... :P

First of all, your title should be in the format of MMM DD HH:MM UTC - (Information), Secondly, you should be using UTC time, not GMT, which are the same, but UTC is used here. Thirdly, the only information you have is the gametype, time, and the nether, no subrules or other paraphernalia. Please look at other posts and follow the format next time. Also, you cannot post a match less than an hour before the actual match.
:') I'm sure we will all miss you del, have a great time at college, the dragon rush I played with you was one of the most memorable games I ever played, and UHCS was (and is) a big deal to me :) good luck out there!  ...and come back for a visit...ya hear?
Hopefully, all went well except that the whitelist should have been cut off at the time you got twenty, and that you should have pregened.
Practice your pvp overall, and start with an FFA, learn the basics, maybe some tactics, and listen to what some people say in chat, because while sometimes it is really annoying things that arent relevant, sometimes it is helpful. Keep the mentality too at the start of the game, that you will only have 10 hearts, and thats it.  And remember, baby zombies will eat your face, skellies have aimbot, and that the nether is over-powered.
I'll (try to) be there!
It didn't matter who said it, i was merely asking why it said that, when that obviously is not a sign of good hosting. Replying "shut the fuck up" also is not, and was completely uncalled for, I replied back as narrow minded as you did. I'm not the only one that had a problem with your matches, or this being the first, and I'm sure, not the last, you may want to learn to respect people before they will respect you, and don't go "you swore at me, nyanya" While it may not have been one of the most mature things I've done, you swore at me first, and I don't "bow down" to hosts, I play with them mutually, and respect them. You, I have no respect for whatsoever.
Apparently you could have logged back in, and I had asked the host (who, contrary to what it says here, was t4t4t4t4, not actually_yes) why he had not replied, and he said he was afk. I then complained that he had said "this is an impromptu, do not complain about lag and bad hosting" and i said that gave no right to not host correctly. To that, actually_yes replied with "shut the f*ck up" and i replied back as narrow minded as he did. He then banned me for: faggot.
