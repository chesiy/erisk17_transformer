Or Ascension. I thought for sure that would be on there as she's a main character and all
At least he still knows how to bed at this point
That was going to be my exact comment.
How does this help with produce?
Is this all versions of these or just older versions of them?
Getting it in Columbus, OH right now
Shouldn't there be something about his body acting as a resistor while he assaulted the battery?
Or Arizona
Paper and Flexible Substrates as Materials for Biosensing Platforms to Detect Multiple Biotargets
I used to always buy Intel, and it worked great. Still works great. My 7.5 year old laptop still runs very manageably for most things, including 720P video (1080P is a bit of a struggle). Then I read an article about how much of an asshole they are when I was working on an HTPC about a month ago. I went with AMD (they also have better integrated graphics IMO) and it's been running amazing and was probably half the price of a comparable Intel chip
Yes, exactly
So is this original theatrical edition, special edition, or special Lucas edition?
No, it doesn't. If, for example, an army base has no walls or security than another army base, but people are trying to get into the other army base more often, it does not mean the first base is more secure. It means that fewer people want to get in. While that does mean a lower chance of being compromised, as you say, that does not mean more secure.  More secure means that if there is an attack, or whatever, you can block it and not be compromised. Maybe that's through being more difficult to infiltrate or some other method, but a simple lack of attacks does not mean more secure
Sounds more like a voting problem to me
I'd say industrial hygienists are safe (workplace safety) but that can possibly be included in HVAC as they do a lot with ventilation
too bad we can't/haven't sent a telescope/explorer with the imaging quality of Hubble out that far (or have we and they just operate differently where the one we sent takes one picture while Hubble uses lots to make this image?)  Could get better pictures that way, not that these are bad
So you'd be willing to live with clear Coca Cola?
I remember seeing something on here about it not too long ago, so that was probably it
Such a good boy!!!
I love and hate you at the same time for this photo
You'll get better at it as you go, so start with what you can manage, then do something else. As you work through it, what you can do will probably increase. Also, not knowing your major, you don't always need to read the whole article to understand what they're claiming and how they did it. This is a big time saver.  Also, organize your stuff. Whether it's Mendeley (my favorite), Endnote, ReadCube, or another program, don't just have a folder on your desktop or documents folder with PDFs floating around. You'll never be able to find anything or you'll take too much time organizing it for it to be effective.
I worked with the base uPrint model in grad school and we went off the service plan and there were a ton of issues. I replaced the print head, the chamber fans, the tips (this is more of a they need it eventually thing), and I've even taken the print head off and put it in an oven to get support material that leaked to soften enough so I could hit it with a hammer while it cooled so the thing would switch between the two heads.  When they work, they work great. When they don't, they're awful.  The thing that happened at the base is surprisingly common I would say. Also, the base plates are reusable. Completely. You can either dissolve the material off or take a chisel to it (carefully) and any material will pop off.
Title is definitely misleading
Is she wearing a bonnet as a strap guard?
Thanks for the review. I'm generally a fan of what they do, but recently it's been a bit of a struggle bus.  It's unfortunate this one didn't live up to their past work, especially V and The Matrix.  Guess I'll probably wait till Netflix or RedBox have it
Prosciutto pizza!?! That's pretty classy
As a new Ohio resident looking for a corgi, where do I get one here?
Here's a copy of the article: http://www.yahoo.com/food/booze-map-of-the-world-crushes-our-spirits-74417073147.html
In my experience as a Biosystems Engineering grad student, BME students just go to grad school and focus on microbiology or optics a lot more than anything you've talked about.  If you want to do prosthetics, find a professor at a different university and consider the field that his/her appointment is in (whether it's EE, ME, BME, etc).  The two things you mention are very different, so you may want to decide on smart prosthetics (going to be more EE and ME oriented) or the medical substances (probably more BME or material science engineering).
