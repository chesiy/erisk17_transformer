The more Scott Walker campaigns, the more he proves he is not intellectually fit for the office hes seeking. He asserts innocent ignorance on matters he should by now know something about  a way of masking his apparent bigotry.   I don't care much for Richard Cohen, but he's got Walker figured out pretty well.
Because unfortunately, laws are always selectively or irregularly enforced. (We could go a long time without an income rate increase if we hired enough IRS agents to truly investigate our richest Americans.) In immigration, there are too many people who have a stake in keeping things as is, so the law enforcement is underfunded and desultory.
If that's true, then [this guy](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/10/us/billionaire-lifts-marco-rubio-politically-and-personally.html) is going to want his money back.

Sometimes, like in the quote above, I find myself cheering Paul on, thinking "Someone is finally showing some courage and making sense". And other times, say when he presented his tax plan, I think "This guy is dishonest or an imbecile".  Does Rand Paul have this effect on anyone else?
As he watches the early days of the Republican primary unfold, he sees candidates speaking out on poverty and showing compassion, a departure from previous cycles, particularly 2012, where he recalls many candidates forgetting the conservative heart.  And I'll bet he said it with a straight face.
The most rigorous research study availablepublished in 2011 by the nonpartisan Economic Policy Institute and conducted by Heidi Shierholz (now the chief economist of the U.S. Department of Labor) and Elise Gouldcontrolled for 42 variables. **It found that right-to-work laws result in lower wages and a lower likelihood of health care and pensions for union and non-union workers.** It also shows right-to-work laws have no impact on economic growth.  Working as planned, I'd say.
Like Sara Palin, Walker plays the politics of resentment quite well. Wisconsin's biggest economic problems center around the still shrinking manufacturing economy, but Walker's managed to convince part of the electorate that Wisconsin's problems are the over-educated liberals, overpaid civil servants and welfare recipients.  Meanwhile he's greatly reduced public services, ended many employment protections, and has ground down Wisconsin's education system, which was one the finest in the country.  He wants to makeover Wisconsin into the low wage model, typically found in the reddest states. I see the strategy he's using, but why people keep falling for it, I wish I understood.
So thats why ALEC and Scott Segal are signaling to other conservatives to shut the heck up about climate science  not because any flood of solutions is forthcoming, but because the science fight has become a distraction from the real work, the important work, which is blocking solutions and protecting the interests of the wealthy.  Get ready for a new exciting set of lies about climate change! From the people who've been lying about climate change for last 30 years!
There are a number of ideas floating around, including a couple in the article.  But the issue is that Walker promised his economic policies would create 250,000 jobs in four years and it hasn't happened.  Instead of admitting that the projection might have been off the mark or that no Governor has enough control over an economy to make such a promise, (or even, heaven forbid, admit  that his policies might not give the results he expected) he's always blaming the protesters or the media or Obama or just about anyone else. Accept any responsibility for the lackluster economy in Wisconsin?  That's not the Scott Walker way.
Check out the ratings for Ted Cruz at [Politifact](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/ted-cruz/) , [Factcheck.Org](http://www.factcheck.org/2015/03/factchecking-ted-cruz/) or the [Washington Post's Fact Checker] (http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/category/2016-candidates/).  Why does this guy still have any credibility at all?  Except for on the subject of [toilet seats](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/ted-cruz/statements/byruling/true/).  He's a real truth teller when the subject is toilet seats.
Then I'm sure ALEC is in favor of lowering the wages down for bankers and CEO's ... Wait, or do they mean somebody else's wages?  The American worker really needs to wise up that there's an obscene rakeoff going on at the top. We can't have decent wages and social services while supporting a greedy upper class.
Unsurprising turn of events.  The GOP should adopt a new slogan - 'Vote Republican - You don't want any rights or protections at work anyway.'
I think everything is working as planned.  Most of the earlier tax cutting was on income taxes, and are being replaced with 'much regretted' consumption taxes and fees, which fall more heavily on lower and middle classes.  I used to believe the good sense of the American people wins out in the end.  Now, I'm beginning to think it's their gullibility.
The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president.  I don't recall any recent Democratic Congressional leader saying anything like this.  If I've missed it, please direct me to the source. Regardless, I fail to see where Obama has been any more unreasonable in his dealings with Congress than any other recent President.  And it seems to me everyone , Democratic and Republican, always complains that the failure to compromise is on the other side.
That's an impressive accomplishment. I doubt I would have done nearly as well in your situation.  But I fail to see what the advantage is in charging tuition for community college, any more than to charge to go to high school.  There's a pretty good argument that "both history and economics suggest that nothing may have a greater effect on the future of living standards than education policy" ([Link](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/09/upshot/the-roots-of-obamas-ambitious-college-plan.html). We need an educated workforce, and we should be doing every damn thing we can to make one.
And Ha!
Meanwhile Democrats, who should naturally have the upper hand in any honest fight for the increasingly populist American electorate, were too busy running away from President Obama to embrace the effective aspects of his agenda. As Andrew Sullivan wrote on Election Night, If you wonder, as I do, why Democrats never actually defend their policies or even achievements in power, and run solely on some poll-tested social issues, then your bafflement will likely only increase tonight, as mine has. The New Republics Alec MacGillis noted that in the three states that saw the biggest coverage gains under ObamacareKentucky, Arkansas and West VirginiaDemocratic Senate candidates shied away from pointing that out. And all lost badly, MacGillis tweeted.  Do you think the Democrats will ever offer the electorate a real choice?  Or are we in for more years of 'not quite as horrible as Republicans' as our alternative?
Poverty persists in America because [real income in the lowest quintile has fallen by 16% over the last 15 years.] (http://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/Household-Income-Distribution.php ). and that's largely due to wage stagnation.  Talk about government programs failing to solve poverty misses the real cause.
1) If the legislators pushing voter ID were truly worried about voter fraud, they would make provisions so every voter had an ID. When you have laws in Texas that make a gun ID valid for voting (more often owned by conservatives) and a student ID not valid (a group that tends to vote more liberal), it strains credulity to think it's only about voter fraud. 2) In person voter fraud is insignificant, less that a rounding error. I'd be far more concerned about who counts the votes.
"I don't know the answer to that question," Ryan said. "I don't think science does, either."  This quote from a man who accepts inane economic theories that serve his agenda as fact.
True, but's it's so amusing. I particularly enjoy this part.   Ryan professed not to know the price of the wine, and one of his buddies responded to Feinberg's chastisement by loudly saying, "Fuck her," Feinberg told TPM.  Ryan is a guy who complains about the lack of civility in politics and public life.  But when he had an opportunity to correct one of his buddies, appears he didn't step up.
That's a pretty funny simile. I'm gonna steal it and claim it as my own, just like a banker.
I think that's a good move. US has been giving away its resources as ludicrously low prices for centuries.  If we're having an oil and gas boom without selling government resources, why put them on the market now?  And I would think our free market friends don't want the government competing with private industry to sell mineral rights.
Kind of like a has been athlete, still hanging on, hoping to recreate his glory days.  Or a washed out classic rocker (who would be Will's contemporary) ,turning out stale rehashes of his successes.
I halfway agree with you.  The Republican Party is the only thing that manages to make the Democrats look good.
Considering Bush left him two wars, an economy in shambles and a civilization threatening climate problem (Sorry,but I think scientists usually know what they're talking about) , and he had to deal with a Senate that set the record for filibusters and a House that came close to causing a default on the national debt because it wanted to pitch a tantrum about the ACA, I'd say he's done all right.  Of course Dick Cheney is still eligible to run for President, if you'd like a repeat of the Bush administration.
[Maybe, maybe not.](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/10/books/in-gunfight-adam-winkler-traces-the-gun-control-battle.html?pagewanted=all) Although some gun-rights advocates talk as though gun control were a modern, 20th-century invention of an increasingly meddlesome government, the historical passages in Gunfight suggest otherwise. Not only did the nations founders balance gun rights with public safety needs, Mr. Winkler says, but the wild, wild west wasnt all that wild. According to the research of one scholar he cites, almost everyone carried firearms in the untamed wilderness, which was full of dangerous American Indians, outlaws and bears, but in the towns where people lived and businesses operated, there were often blanket ordinances against the carrying of arms by anyone. One of the towns with strict rules was the notorious Dodge City, Kan.
Ripping off a song you heard by another performer and trying to take credit for writing it? Here's [somebody else](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Got_My_Mojo_Working#Litigation) who did  that .  It's as old as the blues, and probably almost as old as music.  Still I think Led Zeppelin has been notably egregious in borrowing and not giving proper credit.  The worst case  was "Bring it on Home", where Robert Plant imitates Sonny Boy Williamson for the first verse and chorus and the song's ending, yet Williamson and Dixon received no credit. (Jimmy Page tried to dismiss it an homage to Sonny Boy, and claimed it was 'only a few seconds of music'.) Compare them to the Rolling Stones , who covered many old blues songs and always gave credit, used blues bands for their opening acts and even got Howling Wolf a slot to perform on Shindig!
Karl Rove is the dung beetle of American politics.
If you want to read a refutation of this article, read the New York Times article it [links to](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/26/business/economy/making-sense-of-income-inequality.html?_r=1).  Especially the last few paragraphs.   One of the plausible consequences of rising inequality is that it allows the 1 percent to take control of the political system, purchasing the power needed to maintain the status quo. If that is the case  and there is plenty of suggestive evidence of this  the widening of the income gap would prove irreversible. Mr. Jencks describes the state of the debate between friends and foes of inequality in these terms: Can I prove that anything is terrible because of rising inequality? Not by the kind of standards I would require. But can they prove I shouldnt worry? They cant do that either. That, alone, is enough to spur action. Something that looks bad is coming at you, he said. Saying that we shouldnt do anything about it until we know for sure would be a bad response.  That last statement is also a pretty good argument for starting to make the adjustments needed for climate change, starting now.
