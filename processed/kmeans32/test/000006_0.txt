Takeoff [Knights of Sidonia: Battle for Planet Nine]
The smoke and fog effects looked great. The fogginess really made the battle atmospheric. I wish the explosions were of the same quality, just like the one in the Blame! clip.  Did not expect Benisuzume to make an appearance, and it's a 2.0 version. So Gaunas are also attracted to Higgs particles. Time to switch to an alternative fuel source!  **Gifs**  [Benisuzume 2.0](https://streamable.com/jb00)  [Tsugumori Mk.

A frugal and squatter MC and a panhandling cat as a sidekick. Perfect combo.
Every season I sometimes pickup an anime with a wacky concept (e.g. Kancolle, Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei) just for the novelty of it and with very little expectations. This was my pick for this season and it was definitely better than expected. But now I have some expectations for it and the prospect of adapting a bunch of chapters into 12 episodes doesn't sound too encouraging. I think as long as the show remains funny I'll be satisfied, then give the manga a read sometime later.

This was my second read through so it didn't affect me as much but I remember being close to tearing up at the "I love you" part. The nice slow build up to that part was what made it so emotive.  The rooftop scene was practically Kaori's love confession so this letter was more of a reinforcement of her feelings and less of a confession beyond the grave. Although some may feel it's still the latter and be peeved by it.  I thought it was a great manga. Kousei's character development had an ebb and flow to it instead of a linear progression. It made his development feel natural since people don't improve and change at a constant pace. The story was also very effective at demonstrating the notion of bonding, healing and expressing oneself through music. I think this was less of a love story and more of a human drama between two people supporting each other through music as they navigate lifes tribulations.
I wonder if Galfa would go through with it. He's been turning to a pretty despicable human being so far. I called him a douchebag a few weeks ago and got downvoted. I don't think that assessment has been far off.
Small Garden (2014) - Story of a life form which wakes up in an unknown mysterious world.
"It's all the same whether you're here or not"  The call back to that line at the end and the delivery of "I'll be here with you" were perfect and painful.  I'm with everyone here, Tsubaki needs to confess at this point. The emotional build up is at its crescendo and it would be a shame if it gets dragged out.
The characters feel alive. There's constant facial expressions (eyes, eye brows, mouth) and body language during dialogues. The mouth is animated to match how they speak (like Akira) so there's little flapping mouth effect unlike in most anime. The mouth movements weren't always perfect but I thought they looked good for the most part.  The shadows are dynamic. If you watch the facial animation video again, you'll notice the character's flapping tunic casts a shadow that moves along with it.  For more dynamic movements, I think the videos I posted are representative of the show.  As for negatives, I wish this was fully animated at 24 fps especially since the overall animation is really well done. After years of watching limited animation, I'm used to 12 fps but I hope CG anime would eventually progress to 24 fps. The 24 fps portion of Knights of Sidonia looked really good.  I also wish Ronja's running animation had more variety, she runs a bit too perfectly like a track athlete.

Your complaint has been less and less of a problem lately, at least with the shows that I've been watching. Take Akame ga Kill for example. It's a rather low budget looking show but the dialogues are handled competently.  Let's use this scene as an example: http://a.pomf.se/olnybc.webm  Shot by shot breakdown  Establishing shot  a wide shot that gives a sense of time and place. The two characters are at a dinner table and its late afternoon (sunset colored sunlight)  Medium close-up of prime minister  High angle shot behind the prime minister with the camera tilting  yes this fits your complaint about characters talking while facing away from the camera but this actually serves a purpose. The camera tilting to the prince is a visual of the dialogue flow with him at the receiving end.  Medium close-up of the prince (continuity from the tilt shot)  Medium shot of prime minister (shot reverse shot). Prince holds up a paper and PM looks at it.  Cut to an eyeline match of what the PM is looking at, which is the paper with a list on it (again this is continuity from the last shot).  Close up of PM (with some badly done shallow focus) and then prince (shot reverse shot). The close ups give a better sense of their predicament.  Re-establishing shot, slow zoom out and fade out to black.  The cinematography wasn't elaborate. It wasn't compositionally heavy, although the arc in the background was used as a framing element and the ray of light as leading lines. But, IMO it wasn't stale shot making and had a decent grasp of visual continuity.

It's freakin excellent. My AOTY last year and will go down as one of my all time favorites. I'm glad that this will give it a bit more exposure.
Battleship in Space
Watch the remake, Space Battleship Yamato 2199. It's amazing.
Why the fuck is there a case of mass destruction inside a Gastrea?  Also, some of these scenes are put together well with decent enough dialogue but the overacted voice acting spoil these scenes. The screaming and wailing can be a bit grating which is a shame since I like how the show is building up the bond between Rentaro and Enju.
The way this show presents different story elements is so disjointed. There's just too much stuff going and the show is not doing much in a way of making sense of them. It was kind of forgivable after the 1st episode but after the 2nd one it becomes worrisome.  I hope there's some sort of pay-off here that would justify the chaotic storytelling.
I'm gonna be avoiding Sportcenter tonight, don't wanna see that ending again.  I wanted this win bad not just for the standings but for more momentum heading into the games against OKC and Indiana.
[In the OP there's a little girl cuddled up with little Kal-el.](http://i.imgur.com/AOmivlF.jpg) Hmmm, I wonder if that's Claire. If that's true and she's also Nina Viento then this might get interesting.
