Yea I don't like their new design
Shit! I wanna get something for the office and we are also launching a contest so I wanna provide 3D printers as the top prizes. If you have $700, would you get 2 of [those](http://printm3d.com/)?
Thanks for the assistance! I don't have tens of thousands and if I do, I'd spend it for sure :D UK robots are pretty lame, I'll go for the Japanese ones and will update here once I built it.
I just used it for the sake of using Twitter you know, you're right notifications and email would wor better.
This one is the easiest, you use 1Sheeld that connects to an old phone, the Arduino is connected to the master fuse so you can send it a message to stop remotely. With the GPS and accelerometer in the phone, it sends you a text message with the location of the car. http://www.instructables.com/id/Tracking-and-Controlling-your-car-remotely-using-A/
Yea it's for $55 but it has 36 shields and gets me access to stuff like voice recognition and text to speech in an easy way, check this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P35hSIyYltM
Hey guys, Amr here from the makers of 1Sheeld, you can chec out a lot of examples by the community on Hackster.io/1Sheeld  Also you can check out some [projects on instructables](http://www.instructables.com/howto/1sheeld/) and let me know if you need anything :)
Arduino heavy users, do you think enabling 1Sheelds to connect remotely to each other is worth the effort?   If you aren't familiar with [1Sheeld](http://www.1sheeld.com), it is a physical Arduino shield that connects to smart-phones using bluetooth and make use of their sensors and capabilities inside your Arduino sketch.  It is used mainly for rapid prototyping of your ideas. Instead of buying multiple shields and components to connect them to your Arduino, you can make use of your smart-phone's accelerometer, gyroscope, gravity, gps, speech recognition, screen ...etc with out buying them individually. Currently we have more than 30 of those. You can visit our [website](http://1sheeld.com) or our [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/integreight/1sheeld-replace-your-arduino-shields-with-your-sma) campaign to know more.  We are planning to launch a new feature to our platform. We will enable 1Sheeld users to connect to other 1Sheelds from their Arduino sketch using our Android app.   This feature will enable you to:  * Read a digital pin from your remote Arduino(s). * Write to a digital pin to your remote Arduino(s). * Write to an analog pin (PWM) to your remote Arduino(s). * Send string or float messages to your remote Arduino(s). * Get notified whenever an input digital pin in your remote Arduino(s) changes its state.  You have to have 1Sheeld board, an Arduino board and a Bluetooth-enabled Android smart-phone in EACH network node to make use of this feature.  Here is an example code for what the sketch will look like: http://pastebin.com/6AJdXZfY  So what are your thoughts? do you think it worth the effort? We think it will help people prototype connected-hardware projects and ideas easily. And if you think it is beneficial? what other features can we add?

How come! ok try the [Kickstarter page](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/integreight/1sheeld-replace-your-arduino-shields-with-your-sma)
Arduino 3D printer live from Makerfaire Rome
Yup, that's it! Thanks ..
SAM: New electronics building blocks all bluetooth connected! nice idea but really expensive, what do you think?
Print the Legend coming up next Friday on Netflix, Story of Makerbot how they started till they were acquired by $604M, Cody Wilson who 3D printed a gun and put the design files online, and Formlabs being sued by 3D Systems!
Well I haven't tried it and most probably will get an Android! The iPhone 6 is really ridiculous.
