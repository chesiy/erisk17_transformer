Circlejerk is 420 thousand dank memer atheist top minds. If we really wanted to we could invade New Zealand and install a new Ron Sanders as president. We definitely have the manpower. There are plenty of veterans here. Plus everyone here knows where the magazine release is On a gun is from years of reking scrubfags  Realistically the Circlejerk Meme Force would be far more effective than half the world's militaries. The Afghan military is fucked up on opium. The Iraqi army cant even do jumping jacks. Plus New Zealand has only 8 thousand military personnel the majority of whom are unenlightened skrubs.   I don't actually support the violent overthrow of New Zealand. I just think its kind of a dank meme conceptually.   + /u/User_Simulator  /u/test_subject9527
In that same piece I noticed that everyone being interviewed declined to mention Martin Lawrence's name. I did some digging, and found an old newspaper clipping at my local library about three hooded individuals dumping the body of a man into the river downtown. By cross referencing the height of the men in the photo to iMDB records, I determined the men to be John Travolta, Ray Liotta, and Walt Becker himself. It seems they got in a heated disagreement with Lawrence over the proper way to cook the Hogs after the production of Wild Hogs was finished. Lawrence wanted medium rare but the rest were all hankering for well done. They killed him, and ate the hogs after vowing never to speak of what happened. I obtained this information at great risk to a bus boy from Belize, so be careful who you tell.    + /u/User_Simulator  /u/test_subject9527
Just because it's popular here doesn't mean it's popular where it matters. This movie is an underrated masterpiece that flew over people's heads because it wasn't as straightforward as, say, Avatar. This is a true modern art film, only comparable to maybe Interstellar and Mad Max (another 2 movies that are very unappreciated by the Kevin James/Melissa McCarthey masses). It was so refreshing to watch an actual mature film for mature audiences,  but I guess good R-rated movies are not for everyone.   I think Karl Urban's performance comfortably fits among the best ever, alongside Ledger's The Joker and Jake Gyllenhal in Nightcrawler. It's just a very raw and dark performance that really resonates with the current state of cinema where snappy happy-go-lucky acting is so celebrated.   You wouldn't be criticizing Dredd if you were a true cinephile, so I advise everyone to dive into the vast sea of artistic and obscure films, and not just what the mainstream media spoonfeeds to you. For every film like Spy, Grown Ups, and Prometheus, there's a masterpiece waiting to be discovered, true film like John Wick, The Raid 2, and of course, Dredd. Open yourself to true cinema, you might be surprised what you find in the vast cinematic vault.  + /u/User_Simulator  /u/test_subject9527

[James Horner did this film for free. He actually paid it out of his own pocket because he loved the father-daughter relationship.](http://www.npr.org/2015/07/17/423899444/in-portrait-of-a-boxer-fuqua-takes-the-action-outside-the-ring)  Southpaw is the last recorded Horner score before the plane crash, the last released score will be for "The 33."   But Horner actually did something really beautiful. James Horner's team had actually brought Fuqua the completed written score for The Magnificent Seven. You can actually hear in the interview that Fuqua was really touched by Horner's gesture because he didn't do it for money. He just did it because he loved the script.   It's incredibly touching to hear these stories, especially from Fuqua who you can hear get choked up about it, and hopefully we'll be able to hear Horner's final score.
Proving my point, how does this prove in any way shape or form that I am a man baby? What even is a man baby? Someone who wears a diaper on Tuesday nights? Someone who is 27 and watches adventure time while high? Someone who whines a lot ("there are not enough hours in the day")? Ignorant how? Do you claim to have a fair and unbiased viewpoint of both sides? I personally know LGBT people have a shit time, T and B especially (I don't we should place value on how bad certain individuals have it, more of the whole whining about life deal) but we are gradually getting better and the best thing for that is positivity, not negativity and captious behavior. I am not gonna sit and let people tell me that we are getting worse or that there is nothing we can do except point out flaws.  This is the best thing I've read today.

More gems from a genuine paper mill producing top notch film criticism:  They're wicked and foul with the stench of 40,000 years. But what would movies be without them? While most are truly quite horrific, others are actually funny. But throughout the many years of cinematic history, one fact has always remained constant about movie villains... we love to hate them.   Heroes get all the hype, but deep down, we all love a good villain. I can take or leave the square-jawed boy scout, the do-gooder who gets the girl and saves the day; but the villain is a different kettle of genetically modified laser wielding fish altogether.   Funny Villain have more fun and get most of the best lines. Movie history is littered with fiendish foes, evil overlords and malevolent masterminds we loved to hate. The summer blockbuster is the perfect breeding ground for evildoers and this year's pageant of box office behemoths provides rich pickings, from robots out for revenge to muggle-hating wizards.   Cinema is filled with memorable villains. Whether it's the sardonic cheer of Gert Frbe's Auric Goldfinger, or the sneering oiliness of Die Hard's Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman), the movies are full of superb, loveably evil performances. The hero may get the girl and save the world in most instances, but it's the villain who gets most of the quotable lines.   It's like the alignment of the planets. Occasionally, a great director, an exemplary script and a gifted actor will join together on the same project, creating the kind of unsettling performances that linger in the memory for years afterwards.   Michael Mann's 1986 adaptation of Thomas Harris' novel Red Dragon was the first movie to bring cannibalistic academic Dr. Hannibal Lecter (in this instance spelled Lecktor due to rights issues) to the big screen.   Robert De Niro chews both characters and scenery in a manic performance as Max Cady, an ex-convict who terrorises lawyer Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte) for apparently failing to defend him effectively in court fourteen years earlier.   An indifferent and Funny movie villains can be threatening as a villain with an almost cartoon-like evil uniform like Jason Vorhees from Friday the 13th. In The Matrix (1999), the army of 'faceless' agents are cold and emotionless and suggest an unbeatable threat with which the hero cannot reason or negotiate.   The all-powerful emotionless villain is portrayed excellently in the X-Files TV series by William B. Davis as the Cigarette Smoking Man. Throughout the series he is constantly in control of the heroes and any attempts to kill him are deemed self-destructive or futile. His power over the protagonists' behaviour is linked to his role in the Syndicate, a mysterious organisation who seemingly are more powerful than the U.S. government.   On the opposite end of the scale are the villains that are emotive, excitable and with exaggerated personas as demonstrated by Heath Ledger's villain in the most-recent Batman film, The Joker. The latest incarnation of the Clown Prince of Crime perfectly conveys his lack of empathy and almost-humorous contempt for human life. The most prominent aspect of The Joker is his colourful clothing and unusual physical appearance, with white face make-up, dyed green hair and smudged red lipstick.
Paper Mill Review of Secret Diary of a Call Girl   This is a film which involve sex industry. Sometimes I think I would rather to catch a triply to watch than to sleep with a dull man, Because each set is very short, it probably still can give you the climax, even it is a neuter version. I still remembered that I really did't think Belle is a beautiful woman when I watched season one. But I have been able to appreciate her beauty to season four. I like to watch her to receive each customer in high spirit. She let me become more believe that there is some people really like to be a prostitute as career. From her, I felt a little shamed, I just in labor, I didn't work hard.but she does't.   Ben and Han is alike,both are brave,Both have the courage to make a choice, choose what they want, rather than they should.From the start, Ben appeared in Han's world, his state cannot be removed. From season one Ben delayed he and Vanessa' s wedding ceremony, at that moment, I knew he was really love Han.real love. But they finally broke up. Ben wants a family,but Hannah cannot give. just because she know she cannot give,she choose to leave. Hannah just wants to be herself.They separate,not because they don't love each other, they are too love.they love, but cannot give each other they want. So they say goodbye. Losing Ben, it means, Hannah and bell lose everything, but she finally decide so. love, like on you.   In fact, I know they will not be together at last, but I still hoping. Finally I having no choice but to Give up the lens. Sometimes. Two people who love each other deeply always can not be together. That's it. If it's you. Would you do as Hannah. Choose to leave because love too much. When you can't give your lover what he needs. When you can't let him be happiness. choose to leave is more great than to possess him.
"All of these histrionic hyperbolae and identity politics and psychodramas are part and parcel of the media's stock in trade...many of whom are by now all too familiar with its played-out professional victim routine."   Allow me to submit for your fair-minded consideration the following "news diff" of a recent article from the venerable New York Times. Compare and contrast, if you will, these two timestamped versions of the "same" story on Ellen Pao's resignation from Reddit:  [Comparing: Its Silicon Valley 2, Ellen Pao 0: Fighter of Sexism Is Out at Reddit](http://newsdiffs.org/diff/934341/934454/www.nytimes.com/2015/07/11/technology/ellen-pao-reddit-chief-executive-resignation.html)  Now you may not care about the goings on at Reddit, but be that as it may, this shoddy piece of yellow journalism perfectly exemplifies the *narrative* that pervades so much of today's news. What was once a merely slanted article entitled "Ellen Pao Is Stepping Down as Reddits Chief" was swiftly replaced by an outright propaganda piece painting Pao as a heroic but embattled warrior for equal rights in the midst of that oppressive white boy's club we call Silicon Valley, wherein she "fell victim" to the overwhelming sexism and racism which is both inherent to the tech scene and rampant among the vile Reddit userbase. Of course nothing could be further from the truth, yet an "op-ed" label somehow escaped this nakedly biased writeup.  In reality, Ellen Pao "fell victim" only to her own poor decisions, her own incompetence, her court-documented history of abusing coworkers and subordinates (male and female), her and her husband's shady grifter past of long-cons and frivolous discrimination suits seeking outrageous payoffs, her being completely out-of-touch with the very community she was brought in to manage, her intentionally vague and widely reviled initiative to transform all of Reddit into a so-called "safe space" (despite years of drastic increases in censorship across almost all of Reddit), her brazen double-standards in applying said policy to ban specific subreddits while leaving many more hateful, toxic, and rule-breaking subreddits untouched, her lack of desire to use Reddit or even understand how it works (in one celebrated instance, she actually tried linking to a message from her own inbox, like a boss), her off-site PR campaigns in defense of her bad decisions and policies on places like Buzzfeed (reviled by many Redditors) rather than engaging directly with the Reddit community (as challenging as that may be), her callous sacking of popular employees such as /u/kickme444 who ran Reddit's yearly secret santa gift exchange and was reportedly terminated *because he had leukemia... even though he was able to work* (he later deleted his story and said he'd only discuss it with Reddit Inc, so it would seem that Pao's legal team intimidated him into shutting up), and last but certainly not least her reply at a company meeting that "you'll have to pry this position from my cold, dead hands" upon being asked how the search for a permanent CEO was going (as alleged by another former employee). This list actually goes on and on; this was really just a high-level overview to illustrate what an incredible human being she is and what an amazing job she did as the interim CEO of an online community that was anathema to her.  In a word, Ellen Pao was nothing short of antithetical to the core values that Reddit and its community were founded upon and have historically espoused, as Pao herself hinted at when she announced her depature:   gt; "So why am I leaving? Ultimately, the board asked me to demonstrate higher user growth in the next six months than I believe I can deliver while maintaining reddits core principles."  Although Pao succeeded in alienating the vast majority of regulars that populate the site during her brief stint as CEO, the casus belli leading to her ultimate downfall was her sudden firing of Victoria Taylor, a universally beloved Reddit admin and crucial point of contact for moderators when conducting AMAs. The unexpected and flippant dismissal of Victoria for undisclosed but much-conjectured reasons triggered a sitewide revolt led by the site's moderators, who shutdown most major subreddits in protest of her firing, all culminating in a change.org petition for her ouster skyrocketing from 10k signatories over a few months to over 200k in just as many days. The majority of these moderators are very (if not radically) progressive, often to the point of being called "social justice warriors," meaning it's richly disingenuous to attribute Pao's departure to the clamor of right-wing trolls.  But none of that matters one wit because as everyone knows, Redditors hate nothing so much as they hate women and minorities (except fatties, perhaps). I mean seriously, have you even seen some of the vile names of those awful subreddits they let fester there?! Because if you haven't, the media will remind you of their names, again, and again, and again, as if these purposefully provocative subreddits, whose simmering popularity is first and foremost a result of ever-increasing censorship everywhere else, suddenly represent Reddit if and when anyone from an officially-sanctioned victim class waving a flag of ideological jihad comes under fire for being a world-class shitheel.  Never mind that what set off the final firestorm was the termination of a *female* employee. All of this hate couldn't possibly have anything to do with Pao's shady past, or her shady husband, or her terrible judgement, or her detested policies, or her nasty behavior, or her callous firings, or her ideological hubris, or her embrace of censorship, or her double-standards, or her lack of empathy and communication, or her awful leadership, or a staggering number of other failures. No, it couldn't possibly be any of that because as always, **narrative uber alles**. Now that Ellen Pao has been called a bunch of mean names by an army of anonymous trolls, we're stuck in the "poor Ellen" room, and neither her shady past nor her failures as interim CEO bear repeating nor need be scrutinized.  It's therefore a foregone conclusion that Redditors hated Pao because of her race and her gender and because she was a "fighter of sexism" who became "a hero to many." But what did this "hero" accomplish for women exactly? If firing rockstar female employees, banning salary negotiations, screening job candidates for ideological purity, imposing intentionally vague policies of censorship, and exhibiting all the hallmarks of a Harvard-league grifter before losing a $160 million "landmark" discrimination suit is somehow sufficient cause to be lauded as a brave crusader for social justice in the hallowed tradition of Martin Luther King and Susan B. Anthony, then our brave new world is in very big trouble.  Just how and why Reddit's board of directors selected such an inexperienced, ill-suited lightning-rod for mass-hatred to impose overwhelmingly unpopular site changes during a mere handoff period is anyone's best guess, but what we do know is that the seemingly appalling reactions to Pao's brief reign were anticipated well in advance by most reasonable and knowledgable observers of the situation. What's even worse is that the author of the original NYT article actually sallied forth into /r/KotakuInAction, that villainous hivemind of #gamergate misogynerds, ostensibly to conduct his own AMA, wherein he proceeded to dodge every upvoted question challenging the veracity of his  lt;cough gt; narrative due to these aforementioned pesky facts and inconvenient truths, none of which somehow made it into the revised version of his article:  [I'm Mike Isaac, the New York Times Reporter covering Reddit. AmA.](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3cur16/im_mike_isaac_the_new_york_times_reporter/?sort=top)  As you can see, the NYT wasn't even remotely interested in publishing the truth. In all likelihood, this so-called journalist merely stopped in to troll for hate speech and retreated upon finding himself incapable of inciting any salacious tidbits fit to be plastered over his next edition of agitprop masquerading as journalism. But that's just supposition, meaning it's something I would never publish as fact unless I were, you know, a journalist for the New York Times.  But wait, there's more! Here are some other shining examples of unvarnished journalistic integrity, starting with the highly esteemed Guardian:  [Reddit chief Ellen Pao resigns after receiving 'sickening' abuse from users](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/10/ellen-pao-reddit-interim-ceo-resigns)  [How Ellen Pao lost her job but survived Reddit's swamp of trolls](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/12/ellen-pao-reddit-trolls-feminist-silicon-valley)  The Financial Times:  [Pao quits Reddit after attacks on her leadership](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e833f86e-274b-11e5-9c4e-a775d2b173ca.html)  The London Evening Standard:  [Reddit chief Ellen Pao quits after 'sickening' abuse and death threats from users](http://www.standard.co.uk/news/techandgadgets/reddit-chief-ellen-pao-quits-over-sickening-abuse-and-death-threats-from-users-10382305.html)  ZDNet.com:  [Reddit CEO Ellen Pao resigns after week of 'sickening' attacks](http://www.zdnet.com/article/reddit-ceo-ellen-pao-resigns-under-fire/)  DailyBeast (op-ed):  [Reddits Terrorists Have Won: Ellen Pao and the Failure to Rebrand Web 2.0](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/07/11/reddit-s-terrorists-have-won-ellen-pao-and-the-failure-to-rebrand-web-2-0.html)  Credit where credit is due though, NPR surprisingly ran a [relatively even-handed piece](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/07/10/421877979/ellen-pao-out-as-reddit-ceo). Let's just hope it stays that way.  Now I'm not saying that Pao didn't receive a huge outpouring of crude and spiteful messages, which she clearly did. But somehow I never saw any of these supposed death threats. Yes, there were some death wishes, but let's not conflate "eat shit and die" with "I'll murder you and your family." Such fine details, unfortunately, didn't deter Sam Altman of Reddit's board of directors from dutifully and publicly shaming the Reddit community over their supposed death threats, as though hate mail to polarizing figures in the public eye is unheard of, and as if any would-be murderers reading his patronizing bromide could be dissuaded from sending death threats in the first place. But of course that was not the point of his handwringing exercise in public relations.  Altman's finger-wagging screed in hand, the media had all it needed to run with the narrative that Redditors are literally terrorists, ie. #gamerate redux. And boy did they run. All of these histrionic hyperbolae and identity politics and psychodramas are part and parcel of the media's stock in trade, which is why all of this was predicted well in advance by those following the situation, many of whom are by now all too familiar with its played-out professional victim routine. Manufactured outrage and clueless moral panic from the mainstream media are nothing new to those of us who have lived and breathed old-school internet culture most of our lives. We never forgive and we never forget such classics as: *DOOM caused Columbine. Anonymous: hackers on steroids. Over 9000 penises. Pool's closed. The hacker known as 4chan. #Gamergate*. And so on, and so forth, and so the dragon must be slain over and over and over again, even in our present, supposedly internet-savvy age. Most disturbing of all is that with each manic news cycle, the dragon only grows larger, nastier, and more adept at dividing our society against itself to devour piecemeal both our liberties and our capacity for meaningful and authentic dialog.  https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3d4w47/opinion_narrative_engineering_101/
Shostakovich, String Quartet No. 3, Op. 73  Cailin Quartet:  Clara Bk, violin  Sophia Bk, violin  Stine Hasbirk, viola  Therese strand, cello.  1.Allegretto  2.Moderato con moto  3.Allegro non troppo  4.Adagio   5.Moderato.  **Dmitri Shostakovich, 1906-1975**  **String Quartet No. 3, F major, Op. 73, 1946**  Just after World War II, Shostakovich, then forty, turned once again from his public orchestral music to his private chamber music, composing his String Quartet No. 3 in F major, Op. 73. While he had already written nine symphonies, Shostakovich was just settling into his emerging series of string quartets that would eventually comprise fifteen quartets written throughout his mature life, including some of his very last compositions. Many feel that the String Quartet No. 3 is among is his best quartets; it was a favorite of the composer himself.  It shows Shostakovich in his full powers as a chamber music composer, skillfully deploying the string quartet to express his utterly distinctive musical personality. From a technical standpoint, the quartet, like many of his later quartets, features an astonishing range of textures, sonic effects and brilliant part writing in the service of music with startling emotional and psychological impact. Successful as abstract musical expression on the one hand, it is nearly impossible to miss the topical and programmatic nature of the quartet, another aspect common to most of Shostakovich's chamber music.  The unspeakable hardships of life in the Soviet Union up through the end of WWII took their toll on Shostakovich: nervous, bitter and depressed, he found his most profound outlet in the safe privacy and intimate expressive capability of chamber music. String Quartet No. 3 is a particularly powerful example.
[Discussion] Questions about Footloose.   Now, it's been quite some time since I've last scene the original Kevin Bacon movie about a guy who fights a town with roundhouse dance movies, but watching the remake I noticed something suspicious. Mainly the central romance between Kenny Wormald and Julianne Hough is less authentic than the real one between Miles Teller and Kenny Wormald.  If you're not familiar with the remake of Footloose it came out to the acclaim of no one and was promptly forgotten amongst the shit heap shores of remake island with Total Recall and Straw Dogs. It's the same story except Craig Brewer, the director of Black Snake Moan and that shit where Terrence Howard pretends to play a big boy not on the verge of tears and raps and shit, does something I really don't remember in the original film.  I started getting my suspicions when the introductory scenes between Ren Mackormick (Wormald) and Willard Hewitt (Miles Teller) had this strange air of sexual tension. For instance, Willard and Ren sit down for school lunch and Ren begins to tell Willard of his worldly travels. It's here where all my experience reading erotic novels from Anne Rice and Henry Miller have paid off because Willard starts asking Ren to finish the story of the night Ren went out with two Russian women and had them as his sexual conquests.  Why does Willard want to know this? Especially after they just met. When Willard finds out Ren's story is false he's disappointed like he had a bunch of armed thugs rob his spank bank of Ren Mackormick related erotic fantasies.   It only gets weirder from here because every interaction with Julianne Hough is dry and unromantic. He's basically trying to save this psycho girl from trying to kill herself, she attempts to play chicken with a train (like she was gonna win...sorry you don't have roundhouse kicks, Hough) and she's under the impression this means Ren loves her when Ren's true love really lies with Willard.   As the movie goes on Ren learns that Willard can't dance and that in order to challenge the city counsel on the ordinance to make dancing illegal they must have a tete a tete at a car wash where Willard and Ren talk about wet t-shirt contests. But then promptly Ren douses Willard with the car wash hose. When this happens Willard runs around to Ren and they begin wrestling. Perhaps if Craig Brewer had trained his camera a little longer on this scene Ren would have tripped on the water line and Willard would have fallen on top of him. They would have realized that they are in love and embrace each other in chaste french kisses as the music swells and they go off to city to live a bohemian life style. Ren would become a steel worker and Willard a starving artist painting nudes of Zebras and rats with large phallus's on their heads.    But no. Brewer denies us this possibility for more cock teasing and more audience approved heterosexual mating with Julianne Hough, Now a note on Julianne Hough. Hough is amazing looking.  She really nails the part of playing a down home southern preachers daughter rebelling against her father but she also wears small shorts and this is distracting because it's like on some level Brewer knows he accidentally directed Brokeback Footloose, but ended up having to save face by adding this eye candy.   Either way, we then have to sit through tedious montages of Willard learning to dance, and it's in the key scene where Willard dances with Ren's nieces in a line dance rendition of "Let's Hear it for the Boys" that really seals the deal because in between the already extremely homosexual undertones of that scene, Brewer adds inserts of Willard and Ren learning to dance in Ren's garage just as the sun falls down. Ren is teaching Willard to "fist-pump" and it looks as if they are holding each other in a masculine version of a ballroom waltz. But this repeats the formula of the car wash scene in which Brewer has the realization that he made Priscilla, Queen of the Footloose Dancefloor and cuts too soon out of shame.   The movie marches onto the finish, shit resolves and that's how I learned the remake of Footloose is a great movie about two high school boys testing the limits of their sexuality. And if that didn't convince you, the bearback bang bros bus driving scene will.
Why Christopher Nolan will never be Stanley Kubrick, and why that's ok: From Our Friends at Voat True Film.   Perhaps more than any other filmmaker in recent years, Christopher Nolan has a following. These so called "Nolanites" love to tout the brilliance of his films, and one of the most popular statements has been to call Nolan a modern Kubrick. Despite being a big fan of Nolan i've never quite understood this statement, especially considering Nolan's visual style does not have much in common with Kubrick's. But I think it goes beyond that, and after seeing Interstellar it finally clicked for me what the biggest difference is: Nolan's films lack subtext. It really is that simple. For whatever reason, Nolan wants his characters to say exactly what they are thinking at any given time. If a character is mad at another character, they will state it plainly. The same goes for every single emotion. There is no misdirection, lying, innuendo, or nuance. It's as if Nolan wants to make sure we understand what the character is feeling and doesn't trust us to infer it by context. This doesn't just relate to character feelings, but also to plot and theme. Look at the ending of Interstellar. When he gets to the weird Library near the end, we get it. We're literally seeing it happen. We don't necessarily understand how it's happening, but we do understand what is happening. Despite this, Nolan decided to have McConaughey and Chastain both state out loud to themselves what is going on, multiple times. Why? We already see what's happening, why exactly do we need the characters to awkwardly reinforce it by talking to themselves? This is especially interesting when you compare this scene to the ending of 2001, a film that Nolanites have been trying to compare to Interstellar since the film was first announced. In that famous ending to 2001, Kubrick doesn't explain anything. He just presents it, and leaves the meaning up to your own interpretation. This forces you to think about the film and what was happening, and is key to why the film is so iconic all these years later. This is night and day different from Nolan's approach to a similarly bizarre event. Nolan chooses to explain it numerous times, just incase we were sleeping I guess, and the ultimate result of this is that we get it. There's nothing to solve, and we leave the theater not questioning "oh what did that mean?" but instead saying "huh, that was interesting" and then proceeding to realize all the plot holes in the film. I admit I was in the crowd of people that was really hoping Nolan would finally "grow up" and make a picture that treats the audience with respect, but after seeing Interstellar i've realized he's just not that kind of filmmaker. Which leads to me the "why that's ok" part. You know what? I really enjoyed Interstellar. It was a blast and one of the most enjoyable theater experiences i've had this year. Despite being 2h49m, which is actually longer than 2001, I never felt bored for a single moment. This is the great skill of Nolan...he makes the most enjoyable blockbusters out there. And I accept that. I no longer wish for him to "grow up", because I actually really enjoy seeing his films. Sure, I don't think about them much afterwards and I will never put them on the same level of the great filmmakers, but for pure entertainment nobody does it better right now than Christopher Nolan, and for that I will always be a fan.
