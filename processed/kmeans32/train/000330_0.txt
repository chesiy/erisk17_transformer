My friend has recently gotten into horror shorts and decided to make one for himself. You can check out more of his stuff on his [Facebook]( https://m.facebook.com/kijahstudios)

Weirdly tangential story. I was friends with the animator for Waterman early on in the series run. We had both gone to school overseas since we were both Navy kids. My friend went off too college back in the states and I was a senior in high school a few months from leaving myself. One day I get an AIM message from Bryan Waterman, who I was a big fan of at the time along with other flash shows like Tomorrow's Nobodies, asking me to go to my friend's house to retrieve flash files for the DVD release of those episodes and some files that were going to be used on a movie he was working on. I didn't have a car at the time so I had to bike a couple miles to my friends place, then walk back with entire desktop PC precariously balanced on my bike because my friend's house didn't have Internet at the time and I had to email them to Waterman. This was back in 2005, so quite some time ago. What a weird saga that turned out to be.

I discovered this and cleaned an infested apartment using windex and a hand vacuum. Emptying the contents of the handvac into a spinning garbage disposal was morbidly satisfying after the hell they put me through.

I hope you're happy. http://i.imgur.com/81Hfc.jpg
Only then?
Too much Korra?
I'm extremely appreciative of the story, but I'd rather not give out my name. I already have friend's asking me to do their furniture. I really don't need strangers doing the same thing. lol.
Yeah. I would have much rather reupholstered the black chair in the background, but I only have one of those :/

The rack?
Yes! I'm sorting through all my pictures now and about to post the Reddit Meetup ones. The Pearl pictures are gonna take a bit more time and sorting, but they'll be up later. Which one were you?

This was boggling my mind so hard. Thankfully this [video](http://youtu.be/7INIRLe7x0Y) cleared it right up.
;D
I was literally JUST thinking about making this comic. Made [this](http://i.imgur.com/PVxdX.jpg) earlier today before I even read your post. I start off by boiling about 1/2 a cup of water, adding only about 3 tbsp of natural peanut butter and adding garlic powder, sesame oil, soy sauce, and Sriracha, and when I'm feeling a little cheery, a bit of vodka. Its so god damn delicious.
Its a pretty good approximation, especially if you use something similar to Naturally More peanut butter where you have to mix in the oils before you eat it. Something premixed like Jif or Peter Pan is going to have a lot more sugar and probably make your hummus sweeter, but not so much that its inedible.
I have that exact camera :D [http://i.imgur.com/YthFJ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/YthFJ.jpg)
They're referred to as husband and wife. I don't know if there was a marriage ceremony between a real cow and bull, but symobically they are married.
Is anyone else having any problems with the Touchpad's speakers?    This is really annoying. The left speaker went out the day after I bought it but I just dealt with it since the right speaker was plenty loud enough for what I needed it for. Now my right speaker is out for some inexplicable reason. It had been working earlier in the day, but when I got home from work, the speaker had just stopped putting out sound. The sound works fine if I plug in headphones, but is a pain. Has anyone else had this problem and maybe fixed it themselves, or am I going to have to get in touch with HP Support in the hopes that they can either fix it or send me a replacement.
Tell me about it. I ordered 2 of them for my family and had them send me their money so I could mod and ship it to them. Now I have to keep my eye out for future sales so that I don't feel like I ripped them off. Still salty about the whole thing, but whatever. Good luck on future snagging one in the future though! Hopefully its not a repeat of this debacle.  *edit* Nevermind, apparently OnSale is just a shitty vendor that doesn't know how to limit their sales to their limited inventory.
