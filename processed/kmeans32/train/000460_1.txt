No, what this should put an end to is people who think they know everything, but as you've demonstrated, it has not.  Linux is just a tool. A great tool at that. It's stable, secure, and runs on billions of CPUs.  Proprietary operating systems suck because this caliber of hole goes unpatchable for a long time after being reported to the vendor.  The open source community is hammering out a fix right now. You can thank them for it. They are doing it for free, for you, since you don't know how.  Nothing personal. If you don't like it then call up your OEM and demand something more costly that may or may not work either, but probably has a piss poor track record by contrast.  Have a good one.
Ill say its a reach, but you can bet your ass NK has some gear and the experts to run it. One does not need big iron or even to start young to pull off something like this. One needs only determination and patience.  Of course, being a genius would probably help some, and I dont doubt that there are more than a few highly capable within the ranks of that goverment.
I've seen telecommuting policies fail, and I understand why it happened. It's a new thing and the best practices are often not well understood, and moreover, implemented properly in accordance with business needs. You don't want your director of HR working from home, but letting a few high performers in the call center go home for three days a week, with a robust plan for monitoring performance, should be something tax breaks and other subsidies need to account for. When financial considerations are given to a business for allowing workers to telecommute, checks and balances need to be in place that guarantee some level of success for not just the business, but for the roads as well. Think: small business loan. You've got to prove you are going to make money to get that loan.  This is one aspect of our working lives that is going to grow from the ground up in this generation of professionals, and it's up to us to make sure they understand what it's going to take to realize the benefits.  When I say spread out, I didn't mean to imply any simplistic concept of sprawl. I'm very much in line with your idea of compact business districts with ideal access to residential areas and supporting services, I just don't like the idea of having 300 skyscrapers in five square miles that everyone is trying to get to all at once. Where are those flying cars we were promised? Ah, they are still stuck in those Sci-Fi movies, flying around in cities full of giant... buildings. It seems the buildings managed to materialize though the technology to support that population center model did not.  I think, in this light, that "spreading out" would be a good thing, but again we've never been able to, or even had to plan for a population like this before. It's all new ground and anything we can do towards the bigger picture of wasting less time and energy on unnecessary daily activities is going to help. Prolonging the inevitable by supplying people with the functional means to *barely* make it to work on time and back is counterproductive.  If the transportation system in Texas is not adequate, and we don't have the means to modify it to become far more efficient and effective, then the only obvious alternative is to look at the source of this dreaded freeway congestion, and that's the millions of hours Texan's spend commuting. Much like aspects of modern medicine, the symptom is treated in the name of profit for a few while the cause of the disease is ignored at the expense of many. That's the perception much of the public holds of our transportation system when we pay to drive through the middle of nowhere down the fastest, and arguably one of the least travled tollways in the country.  I'd like to see a more comprehensive plan with a little more innovation than just "its going to have the capacity to replace X lanes of traffic". Again, there has to be an incentive that makes sense in more way than one before people are going to get on board with it, so to speak. I'm not talking about giving away free toasters. I'm talking about needing corrective answer as to why businesses were not incensed to build along that toll road before it was routed through that veritable wilderness.  Give the employees an opportunity to ride that road for free if the business uses telecommuters. It can tie together in the end, it always does.
The man should not be allowed near a gun, nor a set of car keys ever again. It is a gross abuse of authority and taxpayer funds that only causes civil unrest, the worst abuse of power law enforcement can produce.  It is here to stay and we all know it. Our society as a whole is built upon a way of life where killing was the only way to survive. In order to overcome our primitive upbringing as a species we must first take an honest look at where we came from. Once a sobering effect is felt we can dismamtle and rebuild those aspects of our need for law and order from what was once barbarism and moral terpitude into something more congruent with the fact that we are a race of beings designed for killing yet have the potential to travel the universe.

Ok so far this thread has devolved into a discussion about food.  But there is a connection.  OP's hints:  It has to do with Michigan (an oven mitt)  The singers are The Supremes (great pizza)  I will update this thread when someone figures out how to contrive the "fossil" into this cheesy madness.

This is about all that country is good for. The only problem I see is aquifer contamination. Some fairly complex and poorly understood, even legendary geology exists in the area. I lived out there and probably still have family living around Mentone. The stories I have heard over the years about theorized oil bearing formations and bottomless springs make me wonder.
"God, I hate this job" I muttered to myself.  Handing out bags of blood and skeletal remains all day can take a toll on a soul.  "Stay in school" said the voice in my head.  Or was it the bright-eyed customer with wings speaking to me through the cross hung around my neck?  I may never know, but I can tell you one thing: life in the ghetto is a drag. All you need is one puff to know that. A real shame, this chance we waste.
I slept on this and took down the original response in an effort to clarify my stance, our abilities, and intentions. Thank you for your time.  I'd highly recommend that anyone looking to use a service like this pay absolutely little to nothing until the work is substantially complete to your satisfaction or use a escrow or something.  * Payment comes after the job is complete or as work progresses satisfactorily, depending on the size and nature of the job.  * We are not really looking for large jobs unless it is something we are 110% sure we can complete.  Classic case with a lot of small "contractors" is they take the money, have no clue what they are doing, bankrupt, and the customers are left with nothing.   * I have been victimized by such "small contractors" and would not wish that on anyone. * We would require some money for initial materials depending on the job. This is only fair. * Then again, this is totally dependent on the nature and size of the job. * We are far from clueless. Meet the crew:  **The Carpenter**  Our *real* [Journeyman Carpenter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpentry#Apprenticeships_and_Journeymen_carpenters) has been swinging a hammer his entire life. He is stout and limber and can use up a stack of plywood faster than anyone I've seen. He is also excellent with automobiles and generally speaking is a wizard with woodwork.   **The Mechanic**  Our mechanic has been working on vehicles for 40 years, the veritable and venerable equivalent of mastery. Ask him a question about a vehicle... He has also performed his share of carpentry and electrical wiring in homes and buildings. I have been pushing him to become [ASE Certified](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_Service_Excellence), which he could do in a heartbeat if I could talk him into taking [the tests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_Service_Excellence#Tests).   **The Painter**  Our *real* [Master Painter/Craftsman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_craftsman) has been doing paint for 20 years and can repair, pick up, and carry damn near anything across the site.   **The Help**  A couple of deck swabbers that clean like the wind. Smart people and all around great to work with and easy to talk to.   **Myself**  I guess I'm the boss, but I don't look at it that way. I grew up in oil fields and ranches around Texas and New Mexico. I've performed my share of mechanics, carpentry, electronics repair, and am a former professional residential and commercial cabling technician, field supervisor, and quality control manager. I also have ten years of progressively difficult, end-to-end IT business systems architecture and information security engineering. I am also 100% self taught in all of these disciplines.  My full resume is 10 pages long and will hand it over to other honest, hard working people whom I feel trustworthy.   There's a lot of good ones, but a lot of bad too. I hate to call you out but there are way to many shitty one guy, day laborers, and a truck deals low balling the hell out of everything, doing an awful job, and giving everyone who does construction a bad name.  * We are the good guys, but you don't have to take our word for it. * Don't feel bad about mentioning these things. It's prudent and no offense is taken. * We are far from clueless and don't necessarily "lowball".  * Our work is worth good money, and we are doing the bidding on our dinner tables.  * We just need work like everyone else, and are very proud of how we do it.  ---  Because I can only post so much here meeting in person is something I like to do. I've shaken the hands of over 10,000 satisfied customers over the years, and plan on shaking many more.  Thanks for the opportunity to organize my thoughts.  As a side note, we've recently had many tools stolen from a job site, and are having to work even harder to get them back. Generally speaking we can rent what we lost for a day or four where necessary. I mention this as a factor in the estimate given that it may take us longer to complete certain aspects of a job without tools, which brings down the rates, whereas should we have/obtain said equipment then our efficiency improves, thus increasing our rate. It's not necessarily an issue I would ask a customer to consider in conversation, but I'm throwing it out there initially just to air the room.  Does this address some of your concerns? I realize words are worthless without the actions to back them up, but without the opportunity to perform there is no point in even writing this down. **We have references**.
Did you get my PM?
Austin... Austin... Austin.  Where does one begin?  I saw you when I was little, from the campus down Guadalupe,   While my dad mastered computers, I learned to play pool at the union.   Ben White was four lanes wide, you could skate across without a care,   And there were cotton fields on I-35, between downtown and Pflugerville.    Movies 12 was the place to go, to sit in their big, fancy seats.   The Magic Time Machine's food was as good as The Broken Spoke's eats.   It was fun to shoot my BB gun at cans under the Onion Creek Bridge.   It was fun to do a lot of things in Austin when I was a kid...  Times they are a'changing, at least that's what my dad tells everyone,   And anyone who will listen about the way things used to go about being done.   There's even less good taste than there is common decency, he'd go on to tell you about,   I guess I feel in today's day and age, there's no telling how things will turn out.    Now the drag is dangerous, no matter who you are, or what time of day you go,   And the school I used to dream of attending, flew out of reach years ago.   The blistering interstate and buzzing city streets are packed 24 hours a day,   With patrons of the overpriced sprawl running the entire length of the 35 Highway.    The movies just suck now, ok that's not really Austin's fault..   But the food here is hit or miss no matter where you dine a lot.    My neighbors shot my kids' dog with their CO2 powered gun,   And I am the bad guy for kicking these assholes out of town?    This place is turning out like Los Angeles right in front of our eyes,   And the lakes and rivers of the Central Texas region are all gonna run dry.   Plastic bags are banned and recycling is in, everything is awesome and fantastic,   Like the American dream that used to be part of this scene... it's all just made of plastic.  This place's culture, it's character, it's value, become more apparent as we grow older.   It's definitely unique, but it's still part one thing, and it's beauty is in the eye of the beholder.   When a town like this can lose it's appeal to the very people born and bred to revere it,   It's a sign of the times that the rest of the country has long gone to hell in a handbasket.    Austin, Texas is the home of a *very* prominent state government body that will continue to push the line between human rights and corporate interests to the limits, but if any single city in the entire country has the power to change all of that, it's Austin. For every jackass that arrives from another state who does not have a clue what Texas hospitality is really about.. FROM TEXAS OR NOT.. it's like having two good people leave. Just look at the fucking roads, people.. if people don't start understanding that IT'S OKAY TO BITCH about all these things, for the sheer fact that it makes other people feel OKAY about not being perfectly fucking happy in the great city of Austin Texas Music Capital of the World or whatever... people seem so reserved in their true opinions of this place and I like this thread.  ---  TLDR: The problem is ______ people.
A sustainable but humble place in the foothills of the Rockies so my son doesn't have to grow up in town. Would be nice to have a nice creek to fish, some mountainsides to explore, lots of trees. I'd use what's left over to build a big garage used to develop cost efficient methods of replacing combustion engines in vehicles with electric motors and batteries. Enough solar panels to keep a few charged. I'd customize the interior of large luxury vehicles with touchscreen displays, satellite and cell-based Internet access, vehicle system diagnostic displays, maybe even a doppler unit.  Then I'd be in business, armed with a ton of patents, and headed to town to open up shop.
I think it's pretty well established that people don't give a shit enough about the planet to take their reusable bags to HEB on their own. If that were the case we would have figured out how to avoid this pile of garbage back in the beginning of the industrial revolution. Logic dictates that laws must be made to - wait for it - protect the planet from people!  What a concept. When I read about people like this I have to wonder what else they do for kickbacks.
I think you scared that guy away forever.
Your ad-hominem attack is unfounded. I suspect you have ulterior motives yourself.  What, then, are these protests about?   Is it too much:   police brutality,   police state,   wealth in the wrong hands,   taxation,   corruption,   oppression,   government...  no wait that doesn't work.   Or is it about too little:   money,   food,   work,   water,   rights,   essentials,   government,   representation... again, no dice because violence is inherently **about** inequality.  I had to say something and will probably get my ass handed to me, but I'd be interested to see what the motives of violent protesters really are if they are not about being cornerned like an animal at the hands of absolute power.   Spin it DJ.
ooo, this is nice. thanks!
this is a big no-no. you install phone system, you configure 911 to dial 911. digit matching. it's easy and there are laws.  source: designed hundreds of them and *always* test 911, even if you have to route the call to your cell phone, testing that functionality before walking out the door is a must.
This acupuncturist had an entire wall full of herbs and concoctions. Like you say, she would probably claim to be able to cure anything.  Placebo or not, it set me in the right direction, if only for a while. That's what I needed at the time and that's what I got. Would do again 5/5, know what I mean?
Thanks - I caught that "an" right after I submitted this. It should be "the".  Someone asked me to center justify another piece in an effort to convey how the time spent with loved ones being described went by like sands in an hourglass. I could not rewrite the original piece well enough to do this undoubtedly common device justice, then this poured out. I could probably have started off by saying I am aware of how gimmicky this looks, as I did in the original post, but thought I'd forego an explanation this time.  Interesting how you find the second line pointless. That phrase actually served as a basis for the six lines, and was perfectly long enough to fit where it does with respect to where an introduction sits between the first glance and a warm feeling. I am also trying to convey how much that first impression counts, how an introduction is the inch given to someone special who takes a mile, and then some, thus: 'an introduction's inch more than a mile".   I think the bottom half is kind of a train wreck, but if I allow myself to read it from the perspective of someone who has not yet, it doesn't look so bad.  Thanks again. Your piece, "To see is rare", is amazing by the way.
[submission] "Exile"
that the school isn't justifying its end of the bargain  We narrowly avoided having religion crammed down the throats of kids that are already going to have it a lot harder than we ever knew. I'm with it, go to fucking school. Period.  It doesn't mean they have to like it. It doesn't mean what they are learning is true, but what it does mean is that they're learning to do things they don't want to do, and if that's not what life is all about I'm missing that point years ago.  Look, I can only hope there was more in a classroom today besides how to count and turn in a mediocre essay. There needs to be more substance that involves what the hell is really going on with this planet. The basics need to be taught earlier, thinktanks need to be assembled to cater to localized deficiencies.  Calling me a fuck up is like calling every kid that got a 6 year degree and has a substandard income a complete failure. It's not fair and you know it.
I've found that the more you get to know someone the easier it is to come out with words that make time spent together so special.  Meeting someone new is challenging in that you have to squeeze the most out of those first few moments in order to produce something spectacular.  The kicker is, you probably don't even know your'e doing it. There is something about you that she already finds charming, perhaps its the very fact that you don't know what it is.  I've never been good at it, no matter the situation, but I've learned that few things are more attractive than raw wit and humor coupled with confidence and dignity. These are things I strive to find in myself, and when I do I come up with something terrible, funny, prophetic, or just plain stupid because of who I am.  Everyone is different and there is no better ingredient for a good time than to be comfortable with yourself. Being self conscious has always been a big problem for me, and I overcome it by being able to step back and make light of whatever awkward behavior it is that I am exhibiting.  Sometimes it just takes time to get comfortable enough around someone special to let it rip, and it might help to look at it like a buildup. You never know when the cork will pop in a conversation, when the opportunity will strike to make an impression or a move. It's the spontaneity that gets people together, and I'd say just keep that one thing in mind when your'e around her.  Live for the moment.  ---  For you, bro:   Roses are red,  Violets are blue,  I am staring at your tits again aren't I...
i'm glad you got something out of this. i don't typically tear into people but sometimes i feel like i can do something for the both of us when it comes to issues like this. i have a family of mixed heritage and want nothing more than for everyone to try to understand each other. it means the world to me, and the world to everyone else whether we realize it or not.  thanks for the gold and keep your chin up. you seem like a good person and i hope i wasn't too offensive with the banter.
The only thing we don't know for certain is what drives evolution this far.  That's what the *theory* in your sentence is about.  Aside from the altruism I should display, if I were to meet you I'd probably strangle you. Then, you'd have no kids.  Theorize about that.
Wish I could just blow away anyone who I "felt threatened" by.  Wait, no I don't, because I'm not a psychopath. I tend to work out differences with others through rational discussion and informed debate.  I'm reminded of a story about a fast food place being held up by robbers. The robbers had knives and one of the employees had a pistol and a CCW license.  The employee overheard the robbery from back in the kitchen and debated on pulling out his gun. He sat for a minute and listened, and the robbers were gone with a few bucks and otherwise without incident.  He could have ended those people's lives right there in front of everyone, but he assessed the situation and reacted in a logical manner.  Just because you may have the legal right to shoot someone dead does not constitute a good reason to do so, and just because you "feel threatened" does not mean you are in any danger or automatically grant you that right.  ---  The cop says he felt threatened so he shot someone. That's probably all the "facts" we'll ever get.
