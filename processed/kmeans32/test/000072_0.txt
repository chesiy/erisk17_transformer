Ooo Ooo I know this one. So once right, my friend was at a party and he met this woman and then he waited until he was introduced and then he asked her about herself and was genuinely interested in her responses. He talked to her like she was a human being not a conquest or a prize to be won and then at the end of the evening when it became obvious that there was chemistry between them he asked her for her number. He was totally willing to accept that if she said no that wasn't because she was a bad person, just that she wasn't interested in him, but she said yes and told him to get in touch.  Then he text her, remembering that she'd said she liked quirky cocktail bars and invited her to one. When they got there he talked to her like a human being some more.

I think you're probably right. The sequestering thing in particular makes a lot of sense.  I guess what I was trying to do was find a way of using the massive interconnectivity we have now that wasn't around when our systems of democracy were developed and find a way of getting citizens more involved at the very VERY bleeding edge of decision making. Without resorting to some kind of messy 'direct democracy by smartphone referendum' thing...
