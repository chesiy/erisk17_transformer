Would there be any advantage to changing up the type of interval running I do?   I've been running for several years and around last October I initially began increasing my speed for short periods during one run a week.  This turned into a sort of interval run for me where I alternate between 1/2 mile at slow pace and 1/4 mile at the sprinting pace and then the final sprint I push myself for .4 miles.  Over time I've been increasing the speeds, and I can definitely tell it's helping.  My natural pace went from about 7.1 mph to 8.0 over the past 6 months.    Recently I started wondering if trying out a different system of interval running would be beneficial, or if it would essentially be as effective as what I'm currently doing.  I was thinking of possibly a pyramid interval in order to try to get longer distances in during my sprinting portions.  I don't really have a specific goal that I'm working to attain.  Aside from natural buildup for better speed and endurance.  Just wondering if there would be any benefit by changing things up a little bit.
Yup, that's what I would say he is thinking of too.
My brother bought one about 3 years ago at a garage sale. It's fun because you have to think back circa 1995 for what the answers actually are.
Well, at least she's *happy* doing what she does now.
Drivers giving 100%   So during the race today my brother thought of something in regards to NASCAR's new rule that drivers give 100% effort all the time.  With the restrictor plate race some drivers say that their plan is to stay in the back until the end of the race.  By doing this aren't they actually giving less than 100% effort to try to win the race?  So shouldn't that driver get a penalty for doing this?  Just curious what your thoughts are about this.
I agree.  In past seasons when he did hang out in the back it seemed like it almost never worked out for Jimmie.  This year he's actually been running in the front of the pack and it shows with the results since you're less likely to be caught up in a big one if you're in the front.
Hi Chad, you're doing a great job with the team!  I'm looking forward to you winning that 6th championship this year!  In regards to the 48 team haters referring to you as a cheater.  Do you despise them calling you that, or does it make you stronger inside and want to win more just to show them who's boss?
While I see your point, there's also a reson for buying a vowel in the case of the word "the".  If there are a lot of other letters missing on the board and you're not really sure of what to guess, then buying an "E" is a way to keep your turn along with seeing if there are other "E's" on the board to help on your next spin.
So why do these people "like" Xbox on facebook if they're just going to do this?
Thanks. That's what I was looking for.
Not really a big party or anything, but about 12 or so people were in my apartment drinking when I was in college.  The outside doors were closed since it was fairly cold outside.  Someone came in and went straight to the kitchen fridge.  He heads back out the door with our ketchup in his hands and says "now all I need to do is find a hot dog" and left.  We were all just kinda in shock wondering what the heck just happened.

[This](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_Call) is what I was thinking of.  But I really doubt it's referring to the same thing as the article on here.
I can't stand it when people do that either, even when they aren't my games.  I'm glad I trained my younger brothers years ago that games need to be put back in cases and regardless how mad you get, you shouldn't throw a controller on the ground.  Or else you may face a week of not being able to play.  Now a days the game collection is in great shape and everything still works like new!
Hmm, I must say that after almost 2 decades of playing the game I never noticed a difference in speed with the coins.  Of course I always use DK Jr when I play, which would be a faster top speed than most of the others to begin with.  I might have to do some testing to see if there is a noticable difference with coins now.
