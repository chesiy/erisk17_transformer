Here's our story...  I had an OK cupid account, and in my bio I wrote about dog grooming/breeding and the conservation of endangered species, two things I care deeply about. So he messages me:  "Tell me about how you would groom a panda."  He's cute enough, so I do. I tell him about their habitat, their thick coats, their behavioral tendencies in capitivity, animal husbandry, etc.  He's dumbfounded and we make little banter after that.  Fast forward three weeks... I'm sitting in English class, and I see him on Scruff, but I didn't put two and two together, I hardly remember talking to him on OkCupid. We talked for days straight.  So we agreed to coffee. I looked like a disheveled mess with all my books and notebooks for school. He thought it was weird that I called him versus texting him about a change of coffee shop.  It was an awkward first date, I was head over heels for him, he was mildly interested but needed me to wow him.  We were saying our goodbyes, he said he was sure we'd just be friends until he saw me lean on my car, like in the movies. One leg on my car, one on the ground, confident.   He asked me for a kiss right then and there.

I think what's shocking for me, other than the incredible loss of human life, about this is how normal that shopping plaza looks. I mean, yes, this is Texas, but I'm looking at the shopping center I'm at in California, which has it's own history with [mortor cycle gangs](http://www.vcstar.com/news/local-news/crime/gang-expert-testifies-at-hells-angels-trial), and this could easily happen here. Guns rights.... concealment laws... None of it matters when you're dealing with psychopaths with a war like mentality :(  My heart and prayers go out to those affected.
I was listening to my classical music station on Pandora, when this composition came on, or at least part of it. Pretty sure Doc Hammer uses a ton of this piece in a bunch of episodes.
If you disagree with the idea of AKC purebreds, look in to landraces and pariah dogs. They are bred for job and function, and not appearance. Bali street dogs, Canaan Shepherds, Central Asian Shepherds, Armenian Gamprs, etc.  Surprisingly, Russia is and has been on the forefront of good dog breeding in this regard. Form AND function. Not cuteness and marketability.   These ridiculous American designer dogs and overbred AKC dogs will be the down fall of respectable dog breeding.

Lil Debbie,  I don't know how many other gay men feel this way, but you've been a huge inspiration for me through out the years. It sounds odd, I know, but you just ooze raw empowerment, and don't give no fucks. So thank you so much. You've helped me out of some dark places, and brought up the volume on some of the better times in my life.  Can you discuss some of the writing process, maybe some of the inspiration, for your album Young Bitch. Since you've released it for free, I've been listening to the entire thing daily. Me and You is like my theme song now.  I really hope you're high as fuck right now. You got mad love coming from the Valley.

No, you think all those things. I didn't say them. I just don't get up in arms when someone claims I am acting this way, or like such thing, stereotypical. I embrace it, and I continue to live my life within the context that I am not special, and I am not unique. I am simply a product of the culture I surround myself with.  You have low self esteem, and I'm sorry. Have a good night.

Yeah, hence the deletion. I'll be civil.   So before it was more mainstream to be gay, lesbian, whatever, individuals that didn't fit within gender archetypes didn't have the luxury of being in the closet. Men with higher pitched voices, intersex individuals, women that had no interest in feminine things. These people were the first to be out, and were usually ostracized for such. They probably didn't want to 'look' or 'act' queer, because it could mean death, imprisonment, your life getting turned upside down. People within a percentage of our population don't fit gender archetypes, it's most likely a mix of genetics and upbringing. Some parents know their child will end up gay. Some are thrown for a loop.  The world is a funny thing, but it takes all the colors to make a rainbow.  And i was being a dick. So here's my take. My apologies.
I'm balling my eyes out right now   I've been sober 420 days, and that's the greatest fucking number. I'm so happy, I can't stop crying. I'm officially a pussy. Any who. You guys rock.
that's sad.... now i'm sad....

I understand completely. I was just trying to point out that my title was still true and verified by a few sources. I think the mod just thought she was being helpful, when, just in my opinion, it wasn't needed.  edit: also? I don't think wikipedia is a great source? but whatever.
My one year free of weed   It's been a crazy ride for sure. I just want to share some of my story and experiences. Maybe some one else went through some of the same things as I did. Maybe you're going through it now.  I started smoking weed at 16, I was a musician so it felt natural. I preferred cigarettes and alcohol, so I never got too sucked in. I crushed on most of the guys I smoked with, they made me feel a false sense of validation. I stopped briefly, and by the time I got to college, I fell in love with mary jane again. Or at least the people passing me the blunt.  One day a friend told me, "Hey man, you know you need to buy a sack at some point, right?" It hit me like a light from heaven; holy shit, I can buy weed. So I did. Again, and again, and again. I couldn't afford college after another year, being out of state, and too depressed to work, so I left. Shit got worse.  I smoked all day, every day. Medical grade, all the time. I went in and out of programs and rehabs, mostly because I liked the alcohol, weed, pill combos. Years went by. I was moving at a snail's pace.  I ended up moving on a whim to another state, and ended up in a shitty relationship in a shitty apartment. Fuck, the weed there wasn't even that great. But I put my game face on, and bought frequently from H dealers. Never any hard stuff. Just weed.  I had an epiphany after I had some money stolen. I invited a bunch of friends over (fitting). We smoked. We drank. We popped pills. And I cried. I cried because I lost not only my money, but because I lost myself. I called 911 on myself, went to a hospital, and left after 3 days.  23, in the middle of a new state, and trying to stay sober, was insane. I couldn't sleep most nights. I stopped drinking caffeine. I was desperate for friends. My boyfriend and I fought constantly. But I kept my goal in mind, just fucking stay sober.  I had the insight to leave the state, and plan my next move. I found a town I liked, with a career program I liked, and moved on in. Still fresh in my absence from weed, I was still overly talkative and couldn't find enough ways to spend my time. Unemployed. Lonely. A mess.  I made friends were I could, kept looking for a job, and prayed. I prayed all the time. Sometimes with other people, mostly by myself. Some people find it weird for an LGBT man to be spiritual, but fuck, that's all I had going. My family slowly starting respecting me again. I got phone calls from people that cared. I was moving forward, and people took notice.  Finally, after all the job searching, I got a job I loved. Soon, a new car. Soon after that, I broke up with my long distance boyfriend, and I was dating normal people again. Things still affect me, but I have the emotional willpower to handle them like an adult. Life isn't so much a roller coaster, more so a stroll over the sand dunes at a beach. Every moment more beautiful than the last, even if I can't see the ocean from my point of view.  I can't really dish out advice. I don't feel like that's my place. I can just share what I've gone through, and it was hell. I wouldn't wish that upon my worst enemy, even if that happens to be me.  Life today is beautiful. And i'm glad to be hear to share it with you.
I'm in the, "I don't see why this is a problem" camp.  I groom dogs, and plenty of people bring their dogs in to the salon like this. I wish more would. Dematting a dog is akin to torture, and long haired dogs like Cavilers can easily get dirt, grass, seeds (sometimes growing), twigs, poop, fishing hooks, gum, ect. stuck in their coats. Then we have to shave your dog and get yelled at after.
I'm a dog groomer, and sort of late to this one.  I've been grooming for around 2 years now, but when i started as an apprentice, my instructor wanted me to shave the hair out of a bulldog's pads (they have short hair, so this doesn't make sense, though i believe the dog stepped in something that gunked the hair together that the bath couldn't get out, I digress.)   Well, I was doing my job, and as bulldogs normally do, he donkey kicked me. Except I had clippers in my hand. Well the clippers went flying. I fumbled them in the air for a few seconds while they were still running, and the clippers, just for a millisecond of a second, landed on the dog. They made a three inch line of no hair, on a dog that never needed to see clippers for a groom in its entire life (maybe a #50 or #60 blade for surgery prep, again, digressing.) Fortunately my instructor was cool about it, and explained it all to the owners, and took the blame herself. Could of been like a million times worse. But then again, I'm not sure the hair will grow back normally. Bulldogs are weird.

Oh my god that's so goddamn good.
I don't think a lot of people know what a cocker is. Or a doodle. Or a pom. Uhhhhh Maltipoo? I think people could guess that one.
... more the sexual scenes in the book. Clowns give me the heebie jeebies.
Dog groomer :D

"It is a girguin,  A swephant, and last, a seer.  I haiku'd that pic."  It'd be like The Fly, except all of those spliced animals would be chasing me.
When an animal is domesticated, infantilization occurs, just look at the [silver fox](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2010/09/06/mans-new-best-friend-a-forgotten-russian-experiment-in-fox-domestication/) of Russia. Floppy ears. Certain phenotypic traits are exaggerated, even if they aren't what's being sought after.
TIL a TPS Report can either mean 'Test Program Set' or 'Testing Procedure Specifications'. Mike Judge, creator of Office Space, had to write them for a subcontractor building jets.
Our local radio stations have been talking about this story a lot. It would lead to the loss of a lot of important habitat for many species, not just the Californian Gnatcatcher, which they claim isn't even a distinct subspecies (which get's in to the huge, what is a subspecies/species debate). Point being; is any wild land sacred in Southern California?!
So... I just read through **WAY** too many comments and post. As a result, I'm going to leave this here, in hopes that other's can benefit from the eye bleach that is this classic [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0-Sv6YnxEc).
Ok, so as a gay guy, I've actually thought about this a lot.  As a child growing up, it's hard feeling comfortable in your own skin because everyone else around you seems so normal, and ironically being social and making close friendships with other guys, just makes you feel further alienated and alone.  So the conversation, "I can change", "I can get cured", "This is happening for such and such reason", replay over and over again in your young, still developing brain. Then the delusion sets in of, "Well, what if I woke up one morning, and *BAM*, I was only attracted to chicks." It's a sick fantasy I held on to, almost until I came out.  My answer? I would of probably tried to make it national news, and get other people cured as well. Why let others suffer internally if there was a way out? If I could stop suicide, or drug and alcohol abuse, or a kid from becoming homeless or a prostitute? Alas, now I'm out, and **proud as fuck**.
