In WA, it says I either have to have a windshield, or wear goggles.  (understandable).  Legally, there's nothing stopping me from chopping off the entire top of my truck off, and driving it down the road with a pair of ski goggles on.  (no, I'm not doing that, I've already drove with a failed heating fan, and that was cold enough to freeze up the inside of the windshield so I had to put on my shades and hang out the window at 60 to see where the hell I was going).  Good point about the noise ordinances. :)  I completly forgot about that. :)  I rebuilt my father's 93 Geo Metro back in 2001, and decided "fuck the exhaust, and just ran a straight pipe.  He got a warning about 121 dB :D  I put on a muffler. :D I didn't bother with the cat since no emissions control around here.  (why I put on a glass pack on a Metro?  because I had an extra one, so why not?)  It met noise ordinances. :)
They've had that page up for 3 years now.  It's just flat out wrong.  When I called the cable company earlier this year, I had a question about why in the 90's that I was able to pick up cable TV with my antenna if I pointed it SSE, and had a complete channel line up, and would it work now?"  (yes, it really did happen, I was able to pick up a cable system over 30 miles away if the conditions were right).  They said likely a signal leak from a neighbor, but "it won't work now because every device connected to the network must be authorized."  I know that statement is false, because my analog TV just works like it always has, and my HDTV works perfectly fine to pick up both analog and ClearQAM service.  I never registered my serials with them, and just plugged them into the wall.  Cable here works just as it always has.  I still haven't gotten a satisfactory answer to how come I was able to pick up a city over 30 miles away cable TV system on my antenna back in the 90's.

Windows 10, the pre-review: Six things build 10240 reveals about the new OS
Nah, I just thougt y'all would get a laugh.  While I hate to quote a blowhard, "Illustrate absurdity by being absurd".  There's a difference between not believing that U93 was taken down by civillians, (doesn't add up, and I'd shoot it down); v. Lizard men living at the center of the earth and Obama is a shape shifter and also the queen of england because you never see them at the same place at the same time)
Can you imagine that?  "The Last Perfect Day", and then it gets hotter, the sun gets brighter, and then it becomes insufferably hot, and then all of the organic matter around you starts wilting and dying off, then spontaneous combustion becomes a very real thing, then the world literally catches fire., then the atmosphere is blown off into space, and all of the water on the planet.  Plate techtonics break down because the surface is molten, and the planet it turned into a ball of molten rock, and then completly engulfed by the Sun, and vaporised.    The only trace of the Earth left would be a slightly higher iron and sulphur and sodium content in the sun.  Then the sun collapses, and earth is gone forever, (and venus and mercury).  Mars would likely survive as a burnt out husk like mercury is today, and the rest of the planets would be unaffected.  I think I would rather just shoot myself.
I honestly think bill said "fuck it", because for something that I don't know why that the red and blues were turned on.  I honestly don't know why he was getting stopped.  But he outran it, and after hiding a while, we just went home.  He also rolled up on me for firing a AKS on a rural road.  Umm, oops.  He just lectured me about not discharging my rifle on public roads, and I might want to leave now because the sheriff was coming over in a SWAT van to investigate reports of FA fire.  I left.  Fuck this.  They didn't find anything. :D  I guess getting reports of some dude standing in the middle of the road waving cars by and firing into a field doesn't go over too well. O.o  **EDIT:**  I had a police scanner at the time.
"No daddy! Not my bum bum bum!"  "shhh billy let your daddy do his job"  gags you with his hand, and silently pumps away  "You like that Billy, don't you?"  forces your head to make the "yes" motion, and goes faster and puts a cowboy hat on your head  "WOO"  Slaps your ass with the side of his pillock and gives you a mushroom print on your ass, then kisses you on the cheek, and goes even faster pumping away  "WOO!"  You just got raped by Rick Flair, and he's your dad. :D
Sweet. :)  Now to get rich enough to actually do it.  Doing it the old fashioned way doesn't seem to work.  ( I mean actually getting them interested in you, not handjobs).  I tried to get somebody on a date from my FB contacts that I haven't seen for over 20 years, and I think I got shot down).  She's a good internet friend, and lives less than 2 miles away from me, but I just want to go have a picnic in the park, (and I don't mean oral sex), not bang her, and still I get shot down).
A) Money is money.  "equal distribution" makes no sense.  Why should a walmart greeter make as much as a doctor?  Are you that daft?  Fuck.  Cripples and idiots can be a walmart greeter.  B)  Yes, American politics are fucking dumb.  No argument there.  We have a 2 party system.  Like it or not, reality is what it is.  No amount of dreaming, or jerking off in your bed at night to fantasize about the Constitution or Green party will make any difference.
Can you imagine it launched today?  What would Sam Beckett do on 9/11, or 7/7?  How would he have handled the massive power out in NE during 2003?  How about the killing of Princess Diana in 97?  The fall of the Berlin Wall, and the collapse of the Soviet Union?  The OKC bombing?  The Y2K transition, when that was the last time humans weren't in space at all?  Don't forget about Iran Contra, and the Panamanian conflict.  Iraq because of oil, 10 years later, back to Iraq.  Color TV, and NTSC transition.  Antennas die, and resurrected again.  People getting off of cable, and putting up aerials and watching videos online.  14.4Kbps, 33.6Kbps, 56K, BROADBAND!  C-band satellite, Ku-satellite, Wild feeds, DBS, Cable, back to antenna again!  Planes wrecked, monuments destroyed, war again. "Depends on that the meaning of "is" is".  Entitlists, unemployment, economy died, economy "revived".  Housing collapse, market rebuilding, economy is still stagnant.  We didn't start the fire! It was always burning, Since the world's been turning. We didn't start the fire. No we didn't light it, But we tried to fight it!  OK, before I become Billy Joel and start writing Lyrics for "We Didn't Start the Fire, (2015)", I'll stop now. :D
Not the unarmed ones.  In that case, just call INS/USBP.  But if they start shooting?  Shoot back.  Actually, this is already legal.  The only thing that would change is we would be arming them with military weapons, instead of letting them arm themselves with semi-automatic look-alikes.  I think a few cartel groups getting mowed down with M240 SAWs would send a message.  And if they come with vehicles?  A BGM-71 takes care of that.    Set up antipersonnel and anti-vehicle mines along the border, and set up hedgehogs lined with concentra wire, and caltrops.  Put in anti-tank ditches too.

Atheism as presented on the Internet is a secular religion. Let me present my case:   If you aren't liberal, you're "not a true atheist". The only thing missing is worship of a deity. Oh wait, most "practicing" atheists these days do worship something. Government has taken the place of a god. So it's a secular religion for most "practitioners" of atheism. If you don't comply to the "doctrine", you will be rooted out, and banned on FB. Small minds think alike, eh? Yeah, they're "tolerant", so long as you agree with them.
FWI: During Obama's last State of the Union address, he meets his Constitutional duty by doing it, but instead of appearing before the cameras, and all the pomp and circumstance, he sends it to the President of the Senate by US Certified and Insured mail, and calls it a day.   He refuses to make any more televised appearances, and does not give a farewell address on his last day.  He simply leaves when the new president arrives at the office.  No fanfare, nothing.  His term is done.  He gets on Executive 1, and departs without a word to the media.
