SO of a shy guy here. He's missed this thread so I'll tell the story.  We lived together in the same halls, after a couple of weeks texting back and forth (nothing too flirty just silliness) a crowd of us went into town. The girls went to one club and the boys to the club next door. We were texting the entire night, much to the vexation of my flatmates.  When the clubs shut and everyone was rounded up a few of us went to the nearest kebab shop for a drunken scran, my food of choice was chips and cheese. Once back at the flat I wolfed down that glorious greasiness amid slagging from my friends.  My flatmates, frustrated at the tension between me and SO, sent us both into the corridor under the instruction we weren't allowed back in until we'd kissed. I was pretty hammered that night, and decided to myself "fuck it" and kissed him. 6 years later we're still together and planning our wedding.  /u/hoboharty this sound about right?
Not sure about official definitions but this is how I define them:  Fancy dress - generic costume e.g. wolf, mermaid, witch,  Cosplay - dressing in costume as an established character e.g. Teen Wolf, Ariel, Wicked Witch of the West
No problem, I'm getting jealous at all the options you have in the US. In the UK only a humanist celebrant, registrar or priest can marry you as far as I know.  I found [a link](http://humanist-society.org) to the Humanist Society in America, hopefully there's a celebrant in your area which gives you another option.
As a fellow bride with a strained relationship with my father - he won't even be coming to the wedding - I can see where your concern is coming from and massive Internet hugs to you.  Would a possible compromise be, as someone else suggested I'm sure, having your DJ play a song dedicated to your FH and FMIL but have the dance floor open to everyone? This would allow them to have their dance to a song of their choosing without the implications of a spotlight dance.
All cats were female and all dogs were male.
Not had it with pineapple but I can heartily recommend cheese and apple toast. That stuff is amazing.

Get ready for school. I was 5.
My NSis used to take my stuff all time, when her and EBIL were first dating she would steal my straighteners and take them to his flat. Her reasoning for this was because I was unemployed and she wasn't, she needed them more for work. One time I was visiting my FI when we were still in a LDR, I'd left my suitcase by the front door and she went through it while I was sleeping and took the straighteners with her to work. I didn't find out until I got to his and phoned her. She decided that since we would "probably stay at his all weekend and play video games [I] didn't need them."  Another time she borrowed a cardigan for a night out with her work, for 4 weeks after this night out I asked for it back and was met with excuses of it being in the wash or lost in her bedroom (which was/is a disaster zone). One morning I got a phone call from her giggling away, evidently she'd lost my cardigan on that night out and decided I didn't need to know but wasn't she amazing for finding it? (It turned out a co worker had put it in his bag and had only just found it.) She couldn't understand why I was angry with her, even after she admitted she had had no intention of telling me the truth if it hadn't been found.
I headcanon that as First Enchanter he's always been able to perform blood magic but never done so publicly because of the (justifiable) stigma around it. By enabling Quentin he had an outlet for these practices until he hit that point at the end of the game where he saw no way out. Not defending him though because it was really messed up, and further justifies everyone's concerns about mages.
Are you talking about the POP figures? Because looking at your link those are Fallout 3 figurines.   Am I missing something?
I know, that's why I wasn't sure whether or not to message them again. I don't want them to feel pressurised, it's the delivery service who would be at fault. It's my first time receiving a gift from out of the country and I wasn't 100% sure what the average delivery times were either.  Thanks for advising me about the username issue, I didn't know if I could change it. It sounds sad but I didn't want to lose my trophy haha.
Game of thrones exchange...no gift yet.
