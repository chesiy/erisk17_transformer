This is great, thank you for sharing! I'm not on that side of town very often but I would make a point to go so I can run into him.
Congrats on your awesome progress and good luck on this new phase of keto!!  TIP: since you're so used to controlling your own intake very well, you'll probably forget to log MPF. In the settings there's an option for MPF to notify you on your phone when you fail to log a meal (breakfast,lunch and dinner). Also a lot of times I'll get lazy and input everything at the end of the day so I'm not always on my phone trying to find stuff all day.
Sorry, no magic here!! I made them at home, using nutritiondata.com for the nutritional content, but I put into MPF that I used *all* 2 pounds in 1 taco, then x how many tacos I ate. I feel like such a dope! I fixed it and I'm still over for the day because I had steak for lunch, but it's *so much closer!*

I want to again encourage those who are able to join a Diet Bet!!   My first Diet Bet wrapped up yesterday. I bet $30 I could lose 4% of my body weight in 28 days. I lost 9 pounds,  making the cut by 1 ounce and won back $42! Because I was employed at the time I did my first bet and wasn't ready to stop the progress yesterday, instead of cashing out I used the winnings as credit to buy into another game.   True that I had some anxiety in the says leading up to the last weigh in, but for the whole month I was VERY motivated to stay on track and keep up with my food log.  If things keep going this way, I can easily see myself continuing to do bets till I get closer to my goal weight as a way to develop solid habits and give myself a better reward other than food.   If anyone joins I'd be happy to make a team and keep in touch!!
True that most kids just pratice willfull defiance and cover their asses but eventually most children will realize the stupid thing they want to do isn't worth the consequences. Every kid is different - each kid needs individualized child rearing - but humiliation is not a form of child rearing. It's just crule.
Wow this is exactly what I needed! Thank you so much for the in depth advice, I'm going to employ it as best as I can. It reminds me of some bad advice a friend gave me...she got on me cause I said I would "try", and by doing that I am deliberately setting myself up for failure and giving myself after way out. as you said, I'd rather be prepared for the inevitable slip-up than promise to NEVER mess up again and hate myself when I do.  Thank you again. As soon as my situation allows I'll try to find someone in my area who can help!
Man people are fucking jerks. Ignore them, your dog is cute as hell.
Man that makes the band name so much better. A riot of kittens. Kitten Riot.
Lol that is pretty weird, but hey whatever works!! I'm up for giving it a try. Trying on jeans and standing in front of the mirror are two things that I do from time to time and they work in a really unfortunate way.  The night I posted this my husband was working late and I did miss him, so maybe there's some truth to that. I'll let him know it's his fault ASAP.

This might be a little long, but here goes...  My husband and I lived next door to an elderly couple, the wife was sick and dying and the husband was an alcoholic/drug addict/drug dealer. He would use and deal his dying wife's meds in his driveway or right in the street. We should have known there was going to be problems because he told us he's glad "a nice white couple moved in" because he's tired of "living next to worthless niggers." One night soon after we moved in, he was banging on our door at 3 am saying someone was trying to break into his house. My husband went over there with a gun and made sure the place was clear but the old man kept him there till 5 am. This happened 2 more times before my husband just said "it's not my problem, call the cops".  Here's the worst night; my husband called at 1 am to say he was almost home from the rig. Shortly after, I heard banging on the door. Thinking it was my husband and he forgot his keys I opened the door without checking. It was the old man, high as hell and  holding a machettee, saying he saw someone in my yard trying to break into the other side of my house. I grab the Sig Sauer, call 911, and go search the yard, finding nothing. Cops get there, arrest him because it's the 5th similar incident of the day. He's sent to a mental hospital and his poor sick wife is left alone and evicted.
