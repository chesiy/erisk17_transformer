What?
Yay!
Do a lot of People Still Play Online?   I'm wondering if I should pick up this game. If the online part isn't as active anymore, should I still get it?
I mean, I'll take it if you don't want it.
Ai-Ai!

Looking for neighborly advice...   So I pretty much played out my tone a few months ago and got bored, and I'm thinking of restarting my town. I want to get back into the game. However, I put a lot of work into this town and love all my villagers. Should I restart?
