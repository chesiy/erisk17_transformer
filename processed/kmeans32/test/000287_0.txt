**Story Number: NNS150420-19 Release** **Date: 4/20/2015 2:09:00 PM**   ##From U.S. Naval Forces Central Command Public Affairs  MANAMA, Bahrain (NNS) -- The aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN 71), escorted by the   guided-missile cruiser USS Normandy (CG 60), transited the Strait of Hormuz from its station in the Arabian Gulf to the Arabian Sea, April 19.   Theodore Roosevelt and Normandy have joined other U.S. forces conducting maritime security operations in the Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden, the Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb and the Southern Red Sea.  In recent days, the U.S. Navy has increased its presence in this area as a result of the current instability in Yemen.   The purpose of these operations is to ensure the vital shipping lanes in the region remain open and safe. The United States remains committed to its regional partners and to maintaining security in the maritime environment.  _____ http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=86658#.VTVCICeHj7E.facebook  https://twitter.com/Reuters/status/590224264890077184
He also chillingly wrote about a list published by the al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's (AQAP) "Inspire" magazine in 2013, which identified 11 people wanted dead or alive for committing crimes against Islam.    "I find my name, badly spelled but accompanied by a photo where you can recognise my alarmed face" -- a picture he said was taken when the newspapers offices were burnt down in 2011 shortly after a special edition was published under the banner "Charia Hebdo".   "The skillful montage is titled 'YES WE CAN' and below you can read: 'a bullet a day keeps the infidel away'."

A multi-sensor camera systems with video analytic software could easily detect such threats at great distances.  Coincidentally [SpotterRF just announced today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37gpbn2MG-M) a Mobile Radar System that detects and tracks small drones. It seems they can be tracked with ground surveillance radar but at limited distance. Plextek [also has a system](http://www.plextek.com/about-us/press/press-releases/745-press-article-59.html). I'm sure there are many others on the market.  I wonder if such systems are installed at the White House and if not why.
Yemen's al-Qaida branch announced on Tuesday that its top cleric, a Saudi-national who has had a $5 million bounty on his head, has been killed, allegedly in a drone attack.
Thanks for your response. I will address your points later when I have the time. Although we disagree it's still nice to know at least someone read what I wrote.
Besides for the media, I think the police also botched up. There was a massive exchange of firepower which disfigured a victim to the point were he was unrecognizable.    DNA testing was used to identify the dead.  Aavjo ;)

A senior Iranian negotiator said Sunday there was no agreement yet with global powers on Iran's nuclear programme, telling AFP outstanding issues had still to be dealt with.  - "No deal has been reached, and the remaining issues have to be resolved," the Iranian official said. Several Western diplomats have told AFP there is tentative agreement on some key parts of the emerging deal, but warned it was far from concluded.  _ http://news.yahoo.com/iran-says-no-nuclear-deal-yet-issues-still-155828379.html
A very good decision taken by league, finally they all are agree upon something.  -  This force could face ISIS with full power and support of Arab countries.  It's more sectarian (anti-Shia) than against terrorism.  This joint military task force was created by Sunni Arabs to defeat Iranian backed Shia Houthi rebels. Many of these countries would never directly attack  Sunni ISIS.

Ukraine voluntarily gave up its nuclear weapons in exchange for 'territorial integrity guarantees' from NATO including America... and Russia.  The [agreement](http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_25457.htm) cites,   NATO vows to respect Ukraine's sovereignty, i.e. not to invade it, and it's member states will "consult together" if the country is threatened.  It would be a non issue 'if' American troops were involved in protecting Ukraine's sovereignty. While Russia must abide to the NATO vows and not attack Ukraine's sovereignty. This is why on 1 April 2014, NATO decided to suspend practical co-operation with Russia.

I brought proof that before Israel diverted water into farming and reserves, the Wadi Gaza used to overflow during every winter, bring huge amounts of rainwater and disturb the transportation between the northern and southern parts of the Gaza Strip.  Israels diversion of the watercourse is mitigating the flooding.  It's logical to assume that harsh weather could bring on same conditions as was before the diversion.   You [partially admitted to this](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2ws8ja/hundreds_of_palestinians_flee_as_israel_opens/cotynfn).   All you keep on doing is going in circles, [lie](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2wt9kw/israel_opens_dams_flooding_gaza_strip_near_deir/cotx8rn) and [delete your posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2ws8ja/hundreds_of_palestinians_flee_as_israel_opens/).
What video evidence, evidence of dam gates or of flooding?  [Like I said before](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2ws8ja/hundreds_of_palestinians_flee_as_israel_opens/cotnmwi), historically, flooding in the wadi was a yearly phenomena.

EDIT: I should also mention that this would have been taken in 1945 most likely, or perhaps very late 1944, but definitely not 1943.  EDIT 2: I should also note that the US Army Air Force did not use Corsairs, so this is either a Navy or Marine aircraft, as they were the American users of the type.  You are wrong on *Edit:[the first] (both) assumption(s).  In February 1943 the [307th Operation Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/307th_Operations_Group) of the United States Air Force was assigned to the Thirteenth Air Force and stationed to Solomon Island in the Pacific. Navy Corsairs were assigned as fighter escort for Air Force B-24 bombers belonging to the 307th Bomb Group.

You are correct. Jabob wresling with the angel of Esau.   Some Christians try to twist the meaning of scripture and claim it was Jesus. They have this weird obsession with the Hebrew word "Ish" (Man).  Every time it is mentioned in the Bible they try to push Jesus in to it.  I'm in no way a Bible scholar and quite certain that I'm much younger then him. But for anyone who reads the Bible in Hebrew all these claims sound completely ridiculous.  For any real questions, the proper person to ask is a Rabbi.

Hope this helps.
There's an ongoing attempt to re-brand the entire Haram al-Sharif (The Temple Mound) as al-Aqsa, a campain for an overall dejewification of the 'Har Habayis'.   The Dome of the Rock is a shrine (with 7th Century mosaic passages, some anti-Christian) with no special holiness in Islam while 'al-Aqsa' or 'Farthest Mosque' is a 'Masjid' (Mosque) where according to Islam happened the first 'Qiblah'.  They intentionally uses pictures of the 'Qubbat As-Sakhrah' (Dome of the Rock) for 'al-Aqsa'.
