I'm very petite, and weigh next to nothing. I don't need to lose weight, and he doesn't have a condition. We've checked...So please don't be rude.
Thanks all :)
If he's a sex god, then yes. 100%.
Depression, relationships and drama.   I've been depressed for a very long time, and I've been with my boyfriend for quite a while now. It's been a a tough time, I won't deny that, it has not been easy and we often argue. Very recently, it's been amazing but last night I spent a few hours laying awake whilst he was dead to the world, and just looked at him and my mind was rattling on about how he should be with someone stable, someone he doesn't have to look after and deal with all the drama. I am actually worrying about whether I should let me go and be with someone 'normal'. I feel like I'm holding him back, and I know I need him, and am completely head over heels for him. I do try hard, but I don't know how much longer I can fool myself with thinking he's actually happy with someone like me.   I don't know what to do :(

OH is other half...but thanks anyway
I say "you're very welcome" and it takes the sarcastic twinge off of the end, however I do sometimes Say "no worries!" Because it seems a bit more friendly :)
You're very welcome...good luck!
I always struggled with not being able to touch myself! It did get worse with a full bladder, and also if I read anything or watched anything was sexual content. The ache would be there, unless I completely forgot about it by doing something else. I'd take photos of myself to please my OH and make him aroused.   Also, cumming without touching is a very tricky skill that needs to mastered!  Good luck!
I didn't think there were many VS shops in UK either!
I'm not lol! I'm Italian heritage...
