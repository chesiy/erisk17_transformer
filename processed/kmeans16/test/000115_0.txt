Vampires without a soul?   so. In many movies or tv shows (Buffy comes to mind) vampires lose their souls upon turning. A take i dont really like. That would make turning into a vampire totaly...meaningless.. Since you would just wake up after death in heaven/hell/whatever while your body walks around still on earth! Just a thought...lol..
