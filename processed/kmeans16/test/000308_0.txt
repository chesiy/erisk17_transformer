Be kind, sir, for you are commenting on the most gentlemanly of all sub(le)reddits. If you are unhappy with the may-may /u/IAmBecomeGay has posted, then I suggest you show your disapproval using the downboater button to the left.      Good day.
Half the fun of masturbation is the chance of being caught.
Hey, y'all, I'm test_subject8901! AMA!
Check out his wikipedia article and see if you can find the latest edit. [Here's a screen cap](http://i.imgur.com/3ZkcK9M.png), because I'm sure it won't last long.
Came to this sub by accident because I hit the "random" button, saw this post, and was really saddened by your situation. I don't usually give advice, but here goes.    Be yourself, OP. Don't try to be someone else by mimicking what you think is "normal" behaviour. Do your best to fit in if that's what you feel will make you happy, but don't feel like you have to put on an act for others for them to like you; you'll never be happy as long as you're acting your way through life. I don't have Asperger's Syndrome, but I know others that do have it, and I never once expected them to "act normal." It's a disability that people should understand and respect. Your family should be giving you the support you need, not acting like there's something wrong with you.      Have you met with a counsellor? If your family have been as unsupportive as your post suggests, perhaps you should find one have have your immediate family members meet with them too.
My girlfriend's cats are throw up constantly, and when they do they make a bee line for the nearest rug. Why can't they just throw up on the tile or hardwood floor? It's like they're saying, "Fuck you, human, we know how hard it is to get cat vomit out of your rugs."
[Here's a chart showing land use](https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/screen-shot-2013-05-13-at-3-45-14-pm.png?w=664 h=411). I couldn't find one summing up water usage, but there's definitely more than one out there in the interwebz.      [Here's another interesting info graphic showing how much water is consumed during the lifecycle of a typical beef cow.] (http://static1.squarespace.com/static/53ddf6b0e4b0219ea2c8b53f/t/5486139ae4b08d78fd1dd863/1418072986569/) And this is the [source for that picture](http://www.swissbiofarmer.com/blog/).
I don't think you got my point.
How many times will I see this picture reposted? Jesus, I get it, it looks like Thomas the Tank Engine died and rotted. Thank you, Internet, for beating a dead horse into a pile of fine, pink goo.
What's the point of buying a truck if you're not going to use it?      "Bought this beautiful 72" TV last week. What's that? No, I've never turned it on. It's too pretty to use for Friends marathons."
Alright, pal, that's enough. Take your cute pictures back to /r/funny.
It's people like you who make my puny mines and one-storey houses look like a crappy waste of time.
I really enjoyed your post, and I envy you for your lifestyle. Don't listen to the people who are hating on you for what you do. They're just a bunch of unadventurous, scared neckbeards hiding behind a keyboard. You, sir, will survive the apocalypse and have many a story to tell about it. They, however, will die behind a keyboard, shivering in their fedoras.
That was me, not Vegeta. And "that thing" was your mom. Have some respect for the woman who brought you into this world.
There is NOTHING shitty about peanut butter. EVER. You hear me? You could spread PB on a turd and I would happily eat it.
I am Dan Aykroyd. If you assholes are lucky, I'll answer some of your questions. Ask me something, I dare you.   Dong your raisers.
