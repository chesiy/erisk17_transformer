12 Nutty Dungeons   Dragons Media Mentions From the 1980s
This it? From the Boston station but these shows are syndicated nationwide. http://hereandnow.wbur.org/2015/07/16/redheads-jacky-colliss-harvey
My comment was not aimed at anyone who is content with their life, regardless of their monetary success. If that struck a nerve with you, that was not my intent. What I was aiming at are those who keep harping that our membership fee is some kind of greedy con (any MBA can tell you we do not have a profitable model) and that their public forum with thousands of free members somehow makes them relevant in some way. Which leads to OP's issue. And what LaVey was talking about was in regards to people trying to impress him with all their occult mumbo jumbo and how they were some great Anti-Cosmic grand wizards but couldn't pay the rent, so brother spare a dime?  I know this makes some people uncomfortable, but money is a useful metric for success. It is perfect? No. But it works well enough to filter out the flood of garbage our kind of aesthetic attracts.    Your life story is not unusual for a Satanist, shit happens, you suck it up and handle your business. I'd be more proud of myself if I were you. Hell, if I'm ever in DC I wouldn't mind getting a drink and talking video games.
9sense - 03 May, L A.S. (Church of Satan Year 50 Conclave/Conference, Defining the Greater Satanic Conversation, Empathy from the Devil)
I spoke to Magistra Barton about this article and the work that needs to be done refers to the advances by those individuals who wish to achieves these goals, not the goals themselves. We feel no need to update or adjust our program, only to switch focus from time to time.
I have this on DVD and played it for a few friends in my home theater a few months ago. Incredibly poignant on the big screen.
Great work!
Boo hoo. Nobody cared back in the 1990's and even fewer people care now.    The whole Satanic Bible plagiarization claim is old news. Yes, LaVey borrowed from other writers. Big deal. He didn't hide any of this. In the early days of the Church of Satan LaVey showed his copy of Might is Right to his close friends and it was no secret that he was influenced by it. He included a Redbeard in his list of dedications in the first printing (To: Ragnar Redbeard, whose might is right). Big fucking whoop.    As for LaVey "paraphrasing" Rand, that's such a stretch that it's hilarious. He was influenced by Rand, of course. He took bits and pieces of Galt's rambling speech and turned them in Satanic words of wisdom. Great!    And no, he didn't get his Enochian from Crowley, he got it from John Dee. And he actually changed that around to fit the Satanic feel as well. In fact, one can say Crowley "borrowed" it more directly from Dee. Someone call the fact checker!    As from Zeena   Schreck's bullshit, that stuff was dismissed as obviously slander. What's not mentioned is that at the time of the publication Zeena   Schreck were struggling to get control of the Church of Satan and its assets, so they conjured up as much dirt as they could, true or false. Much of it false, with key people rejecting those claims (Karla, Stanton, and even Zeena herself would later recall things differently). Was LaVey the perfect husband and father? Probably not. But that doesn't take away from his philosophy, or even the character that he was.
The way I see it, Satanism is a tool. You use Satanism to accomplish other things in the real world. The Satanic Bible is the owners manual. Some people already know how to use the tool, they've got an natural talent for it. Others need a primer, and beginners guide. But once they got that down, they'll move on and build things of great person value.    Peter Gilmore addresses this paradox in this interview: [The Church of Satan, and the paradox of individualist religion](http://www.churchofsatan.com/paradox-of-individualist-religion.php)    "Satanism empowers Satanists to be the center of their own subjective universe, their own gods so to speak, so it is their personal values and desires motivating their activism or any other pursuits, not Satanism itself. It is important to note that Satanism is not a cause, rather it is a set of principles that serve as a tool for each Satanist to get the most out of life. So activism in the name of Satanism is meaningless, since there is nothing that can stop one from employing the principles of Satanism as a personal tool for survival and prosperity. "

Sounds like you've got some admirable accomplishments already under your belt and a bright path ahead! Magus Gilmore is an incredibly busy man but it I would certainly get in touch with the COS administration and let them know about your achievements and goals. You can use the contact form here: http://www.churchofsatan.com/contact-us.php
I get your enthusiasm but Satanism is an individualist philosophy, so such a social club might not be the best idea. Though all Satanists share a bedrock philosophy, their applications and independent interests may vary greatly, sometimes leading to conflicts. It's a mistake to think that just because someone else is a Satanist means that you'd get along swimmingly.   Satanism is also anti-proselytizing, meaning you should not try to convince other people that Satanism is right for them. Most people will not (and cannot) accept Satanism, and that's alright. Do not expect people to respect you just because you're a Satanist, instead have them respect you because you're a great writer, mathematician, computer programmer, athlete, musician, artist, photographer, cartoonist, etc.    That said, I wish you luck. Peter H. Gilmore is a close friend of mine and I know he got started with Satanism in high school, where he met High Priestess Peggy Nadramia. He graduated as Valedictorian of his class and his speech had a Satanic spirit.
No.
Sorry this isn't in the price range of some factory churned ICP blacklight poster. If that's more your liking Spencer's got you covered. If you want an individually handcrafted piece of decor for your ritual chamber or den of iniquity, then consider this. I somehow doubt this is going to show up in Ikea.
Good luck and thank you for your honesty.

Was it just a hallucination? Sure, but it fits within the framework of real occultism. Pizzolatto says the show has elements of mysticism than the supernatural, which I applaud. There's a slight difference. Within occult mysticism there's the idea that the "other forces" that an occultist communicates with is beyond human comprehension. To interact with it leads to insanity, and omens come as hallucinations. I believe that there's a Jungian, psychological aspect to this, not supernatural, but supernormal. Rust studied nihilism, comparative religion, and researched occultism.  He subconsciously absorbed the symbols, and perfectly played out a blood ritual to the Yellow King (he was the "little priest").
Infernal Affairs; an Mz.412 and CMI Retrospective with Henrik Nordvargr Bjrkk (Heathen Harvest)
Mostly electronic music of all sorts. I do an ambient and experimental music podcast here http://www.radiofreesatan.com/category/chaossedated/     Some recent artists I've listened to: Jesu, Grimes, Youth Code, Boris, Vatican Shadow, Ulver, David E. Williams, Zombi, Godflesh, Dalek, Little Dragon, M83, Zola Jesus, Skream, Burial, Massive Attack     But I also love soundtrack music, I just ordered a bunch of records from Death Waltz Records: http://deathwaltzrecordingcompany.com/
I have no idea what the membership count is, and the Church of Satan does not disclose it. What I do know is that the Central Office is constantly processing memberships, responding to media contacts, and following up with active members.    There is only one High Priest at any given moment, currently it is Peter Gilmore. Where are you getting these ideas from? LaVey stopped doing public performances in the 70's. He never meant for Satanists to do anything "in the name of the Church" other than apply Satanism in their everyday productive lives. The idea that this somehow "changed" when he died is inaccurate.  Here's a video of the 6/6/6 Satanic Mass.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1zsIk6WcNM  Here's a video of a lecture at the Maryland Institute College of Art https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpI_TvJXc84    Here's the successful kickstarter campaign for a Spanish translation of the Satanic Scriptures    https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kevinislaughter/las-escrituras-satanicas-the-satanic-scriptures-in    Listen to Magister Coop talk Satanism, art, and rock and roll on WTFPod   http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_318_-_coop    The Church of Satan does not see a penny from sales of the Satanic Bible. Royalties of the book go to LaVey's children and his former partner, none of whom are involved with the Church of Satan.   What's a good pair of shoes run you these days? If $200 is going to break your bank then don't join. The Church of Satan actually rejects applications and refunds money very regularly. http://imgur.com/E1BPd
Yes, that was one of my events! Blood Axis, Changes, and Dream Into Dust. At the time I was part of TESCO USA. You probably saw me there, and that was the same bar I had drinks with Peter Gilmore at. Did you enjoy the performance? If you're interested in more of the same follow me on Twitter, I'll be doing another event in NYC in October. https://twitter.com/InvisibleWar
Much of this has been answered here http://www.reddit.com/r/tabled/comments/1zgfeg/table_i_am_a_priest_in_the_church_of_satan/    http://churchofsatan.com/theory-practice.php
I can't speak for her, but I've spent time in their home and I can see that she takes a great deal of pride in promoting and working with other productive members. I'm sure there's a level of frustration having to deal with idiots who miss the point.
I'm doing pretty well, thanks!
As you grow up you learn that there are better ways of getting what you need than by crying out loud and shitting your pants. If you have no empathy for others you're likely to lead a lonely, miserable life. I love my family and my friends, and a quick phone call away from them if they need help, because I know I could do the same. Is that shitty? Seems to work for me, with Satanists and non-Satanists.
That's it.
Aleister Crowley has more to do with magical Christianity and Buddahism than Satanism, so I don't get that reference. If you don't like Satanism and don't want to be a Satanist and continue to believe in Christianity and salvation, that's fine by me! I'm not trying to trick you into believing anything.
I lack the full goatee, but maybe the devil has good taste? I don't always keep the mustache though. https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash2/t1/377055_328634853814752_98944796_n.jpg
I am a Priest in the Church of Satan. Nevermind the crazies, let's have fun and ask me anything!   Over the past several weeks Satanism, directly and indirectly, has caught the attention of the media. Lunatics are blaming the Devil for their deranged acts of violence, rumors of "Satanic" cults are spreading among the tabloids and fans of True Detective are searching for the Yellow Sign in satanic rituals. Peter H. Gilmore, the current High Priest of the Church of Satan, has been [a guest on CNN](http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2014/02/17/satanist-church-accused-craigslist-killer-not-one-of-us/), [interviewed by the CBC](http://www.cbc.ca/day6/popupaudio.html?clipIds=2438899671) and numerous other outlets (published and unpublished) in an effort to defuse a revival of the Satanic Panic from 80's and 90's. It's a shame that for many people the only exposure to Satanism is in reaction to such grim, pointless insanity; when by and large the Satanists I know are some the most life-loving individuals I've ever encountered.   Due to the recent media exposure I'm not surprised to see several threads hitting the front page of Reddit mentioning Satanism, attempted AMA's from questionable sources, and a genuine interest in what Satanism and the Church of Satan is actually about. Obviously one can go to the Church of Satan's website and [check out the basic texts](http://churchofsatan.com/theory-practice.php) and [FAQ](http://churchofsatan.com/frequently-asked-questions.php), but we recognize that humans are social creatures and a certain level of interaction can help drive points home.    That said, my name is Raul A. and I'm an officially ordained Priest in the Church of Satan, and have been an active Satanist for over 10 years. In my time with the Church of Satan, and well before that, I've interacted with Satanists with a wide range of interests, personalities, and backgrounds. I've organized concerts with Satanic folk bands to experimental electronic musicians. I am the technical director of [Radio Free Satan](http://www.radiofreesatan.com/). My wedding was officiated by a Satanic Priest, I enjoyed Tiki drinks and 50's music with High Priestess Peggy Nadramia, and watched Kaiju films and talked Pacific Rim with High Priest Gilmore. I've also known many nonpublic Satanists who, for various reasons, cannot openly proclaim their worldviews.     Why am I doing this AMA? For one, I think the Reddit community is interested in the topic and has been mostly given a poor representation of what Satanism is about, in theory and practice. I've seen some fairly interesting questions go without responses, and mostly a lot of talk from people who "read Crowley in high school" (FYI, Crowley never identified himself as a Satanist, and has very little to with Satanism) or "knew a guy once". Responses are often such a bore and miss the point entirely.    So here's your chance, ask me anything! And, like any decent Satanist, let's make this fun! Let's try things other than the usual "Why call it Satanism if you don't believe in Satan" (*), let's talk about life, experiences, and the pleasures of the material world! Let the games begin!    Proof: http://imgur.com/a/wAPvz?gallery  * The "Satan" in "Satanism" refers to the Hebrew word for "the adversary", and that is the context in which we use it. We understand that the human animal has an innate need for religion, symbolism, and dogma so we Satanists willfully choose the one we most identify with.  Edit: I have a business call to attend to for an hour or so, I'll be back shortly!  Edit: Seems that many of my responses have been downvoted to Hell (ba dum). Here's a handy Q A table http://www.reddit.com/r/tabled/comments/1zgfeg/table_i_am_a_priest_in_the_church_of_satan/    Edit: Time to roll up the tent. Overall I had a fairly good time, answered a few good questions, made some new friends, and ran into some old ones. If you haven't seen my responses, especially in the first few hours of this AMA, it's because my comments were immediately being downvoted and hidden from the default views([I didn't realize Reddit were such big fans of the Westboro Baptist Church](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg23j/i_am_a_priest_in_the_church_of_satan_nevermind/cfte5pu)). See the table above or my comment history to see my responses, [which apparently is more than most celebrity AMA's combined](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg23j/i_am_a_priest_in_the_church_of_satan_nevermind/?sort=confidence#cftg9u9). Special thanks to the moderators who've attempted to inject some rationality and to /u/Milagre for the help with the Q A Table.

LaVey was optimistic about the general population embracing Satanism in the early years of the Church of Satan. He was right in that faith in Christianity was in decline, but instead of liberation, the masses sought another master, the television. You can see his growing disappointment and misanthropy through his later writings.    Most humans will seek external validation, especially in the ethereal. Even some misguided would-be Satanists think LaVey should be a personality to worship. I believe in every society there will be rare individuals who have the Satanic element in their bones.
Do we want to go down this road again? Who is "they" who serve to keep a "religion" pure? What is the "religion"? Do you mean heretical Christians? And don't give me that "esoteric" nonsense, it's a lame cop-out for "I have no idea" or "stuff I read online".
