I'm not the guy who made the original, but [here is a much larger version of the image](http://i.imgur.com/5OcatP9.jpg). You could use this as a wallpaper.  I ran the original through the Waifu2x-caffe program and had it scale the image to 4x the original size. (This looks a lot better than other resizing algorithms as it is actually recreating the original image through the training of a neural network based on line art and things of that nature.)
I think the issue with "Blank" is that people try to use it in a rotation rather than as a situational skill.  There is a time and place for it such as in Copperbell where you have to keep the squiggans away from the bomb so that you can break apart the slime. Another place would be in ST during the Amon fight to keep the slimes away while being killed.
I haven't been able to play the trial but odds are it is track #8 on the OST. (My Most Precious Treasure)   If you can, could you listen to the sample of the track on [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/tvanimeshon-angel-beats!-original/id842476044) to see if it is or not? (Otherwise I'll have to watch out for the OST from the game as I want it if that is the case)  ^ It is on the US iTunes.
It looks pretty fun, sort of like a cross of Mirror's Edge and Distance/Nitronic Rush.  The key to this would be how the controls are as it could make or break this.
I never said that you said it was empty. My reply was based off of your "You need to put stuff there for him [the player] to find." to which I pointed out some examples that I know of off the top of my head.
The manga is really good but sadly isn't available officially in English. It switches between regular manga and 4-koma as the need arises which is nice as you get the benefits of both. The art is really good as well.   Source: I own the first volume in Japanese.
Considering the attribution along the top, probably none. I, originally, had this done and ready for people to use back on February 27th which was before these sites implemented his code. I didn't release it because I was unsure of what license he wanted the code to be released under. I released it now because it has been two and a half weeks since the last post from him and I am unsure if, or when, I will even hear back.  If that site is working for you, then great!   The only reason people would want to use this code/program is if they wanted something that they could easily open rather than remembering to go to those types of sites.
As a heads up, you are requesting not suggesting an anime.   Suggesting on here is, basically, the same as /r/manga's "Read This!" or /r/anime's "Watch This!" tag.  I have changed your tag and approved your post.  ---  On another, note you might want to look at either getting an account on an anime tracking website such as MyAnimeList (MAL) or Hummingbird. This will help people see what you have already seen and scored and give you shows to watch accordingly.
I haven't heard of those sites, but if you want to do surveys and actually get paid mTurk would be your best bet. I've made ~$1000 over the past three years of off and on work.  It is owned and run by Amazon and you get paid through Amazon Payments which you can either deposit or use to get an Amazon Gift Card.
You had the wrong flair for you are asking/*requesting* shows, you need to use the "Request" flair.  I have changed it for you this time, but please remember to flair correctly in the future.
I feel the same way about this. I, basically, do not talk about anime/manga at all unless someone else references or brings it up in a conversation. If they do and it is in a public situation where others can hear, I act as though I know nothing.  I had the opportunity to go to Japan this year as part of a class trip and I did pick up a few things while I was there. I was extremely hesitant to buy any sort of figure but I won one from a crane game at a Taito Game Station.   My Mom thinks they are cool and I have no idea what my Dad thinks of them... :/
I know this is digressing, but oh well. Black Rock Shooter is, originally, a Hatsune Miku song by Supercell. I do not remember the name/username of the person, but someone made a music video having the character, which is heavily influenced by the character design of Hatsune Miku, go through the story in the lyrics through the video. That music video and story got really popular which prompted a novel, manga, OVA, anime, merchandise, etc into what you know today.   Sorry about that, I used to be into vocaloid stuff a few years ago and I remember when this was all happening. I haven't, other than knowing f and f2 are out and Mirai on the 3DS soon, been following the scene for awhile.

[Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5781/Isekai_no_Seikishi_Monogatari) - Pretty much fits your request to the letter. It is a spin-off of Tenchi Muyo but you don't have to know anything about that series to watch this one.
[SIB] Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch [PS3]?   I forgot that this game was coming out until I saw it on Amazon.com it looks really good. The two major reviews that are out are giving really high marks to it and it sounds like you can spend a lot of time playing it. Personally, I am a fan of anime so the graphics and general aesthetic is towards my interests. Also, I like JRPGs and the like too.
[SPOILERS] Little Busters! Episode 6 Discussion   Wow, I was not expecting that reaction at the end of the episode from Komari. I liked the touch where the flashback at the end was mainly instrumental with only the phrase spoken by her brother as "This was all a dream".  What are your thoughts on this episode?
