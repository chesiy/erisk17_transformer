The thing I don't understand is where they got the idea that it wasn't a good pizza, I thought it was good, and would have been better if I had paid attention to the recepies an cut the dough in half. I lost the old recepie I had when I moved about a year ago, so now it's experimenting till I find it or stumble across a new better one. Thanks for the offer I'll keep it in mind in the future.
