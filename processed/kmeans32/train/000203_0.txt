YSK Of The Most Common Illegal Job Interview Questions.   **How Old Are You?**  A company always has the legal right to make sure youre old enough to work for them, but other than that, they arent supposed to ask your age (especially if youre older than 40). The Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) is designed to protect you from any discrimination or ageism down the road. Unfortunately, the ADEA doesnt offer the same protection for those under 40, but Michelle Cash at Experience explains that you should still check in with your states laws. Some states have similar laws in place for people of all ages.  Keep an eye out for questions that can reveal your age indirectly too. They might ask how long have you been working? or when did you graduate high school? These questions might seem like harmless inquiries, but they are designed to figure out your age. In the same vein, they cant ask when you plan to retire. Its just another roundabout way of determining how old you might be and how many years they might get out of you.  **Have You Ever Been Arrested?**  If youre interviewing for a sensitive position where criminal history can be used to determine your trustworthiness, employers are allowed to ask if youve ever been convicted of a crime. What they cant ask, however, is if youve ever been arrested in general. That being said, Peter Studner, author of Super Job Search IV: The Complete Manual for Job Seekers and Career Changers, suggests it might be information worth volunteering in some circumstances. Especially if know theyll doing a thorough background check:  In these kinds of cases where a future employer might uncover prior arrests, it is important to discuss the incident up front and point out that it was a thing of the past, never to be repeated. The more serious the offense, the more convincing you have to be. So while its illegal for them to ask if youve been arrested, you might still have an opportunity to demonstrate integrity and show that you can learn from your mistakes. It all depends on the situation, so make sure youre prepared beforehand.  **How Is Your Health?**  Questions relating to your general health and physical ability can be a very tricky subject. Its illegal for employers to ask you if youre in good health, how tall you are, how much you weigh, if youve had any past illness or operations, or how many sick days you took at your last job. However, employers are allowed to ask you about specific physical abilities related to tasks youd be required to perform. For example, they can ask if youre capable of lifting up to 50 pounds, if you can stand on your feet for certain lengths of time, or if you are capable of reaching items on a shelf thats so-and-so feet tall.  Its also illegal for them to directly ask if you have any disabilities. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) specifically states that employers cant ask you about the existence, nature, or severity of any pre-existing disability. They may ask if you can perform the basic functions of the position without accommodation, however, so in most instances, its to everyones benefit to be honest. It never hurts to ask questions yourself and see what they expect from you.  **Are You Married?**  This is one of the most loaded questions you can be asked, so it makes sense why its illegal. Answering a question like this can disclose a lot more information than you realize, and that information can easily be used to discriminate. Hannah Keyser at Mental Floss explains how sneaky this question can be:  Anything that fishes for information about a candidates family plans (marriage, engagement, and child planning) is technically illegal because it falls under pregnancy discrimination. It can often seem like a hiring manager is just making pleasant conversation and trying to get to know you better, but job applicants are not obligated to disclose any personal information. This could also be a subtle way to question someone about their sexual orientationanother protected class. If you do choose to talk about the kids you haveor plan on havingdo so at your own risk, and watch out for more digging for information. Questions like who will take care of your children while youre at work? or could you get a babysitter on short notice? are illegal. Remember, anything regarding your personal relationships, marital status, family, or sexual orientation are all protected.  **What Is Your Religion?**  This question is a major no-no, but employers will ask it to try and determine work scheduling for weekends and holidays. HR attorney Charles A. Krugel suggests, however, that Employers may try to skirt the issue by using simple tricks to get the information a different way. They might show you a required work schedule and ask if you can work with their schedule, or flat out ask you what days you are available or unavailable to work.  Neither of those questions are illegal and could potentially reveal that information whether you tell them or not. Still, the religion you practice, the holidays you observe, and anything related to those things are personal information you never have to disclose yourself. This also includes if you are a member of any general organizations that arent related to job or company youre interviewing for.  **What Is Your Nationality?**  An employer has every right to check that you can legally work for them, but they cant ask any questions regarding your race or place of birth. Employers are not allowed to ask if you are a U.S. citizen, but they can ask if youre authorized to work in the U.S. Anything in the realm of what country are you from? or what country are you from originally? is illegal.  Employers arent allowed to ask you what your native tongue is, or if English is your first language, either. The editors at HR World explain that employers may ask this question with good intentions to learn about your fluency, but it can still be offensive or used to discriminate. What they may ask instead, is what languages you red, speak, or write fluently, which is completely legal.  **Do You Like to Drink Socially?**  Some employers like to ask questions that may pertain to how well you might fit in with the companys culture. This can lead to personal questions about hobbies, likes, dislikes, and even if you like to drink socially. It might seem harmless, but as Vivian Giang at Business Insider points out, its actually illegal under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA):  For example, if youre a recovering alcoholic, treatment of alcoholism is protected under this act and you dont have to disclose any disability information before landing an official job offer. Whether youre a recovering alcoholic or not, they arent supposed to ask. And if you choose to answer and say no, they cant discriminate against you. Any questions regarding whether you drink or even smoke cigarettes are off limits.  **Have You Ever Used Drugs In the Past?**  This is another example of a loaded question that can mean a lot of things. First off, drugs can mean anything from illegal narcotics to prescription drugs, so its not clear to begin with. Secondly, ADA Policy Director Chris Kuczynski explains that an employer cant ask about your past use unless it was perhaps tied into a crime you were convicted of (forcing you to mention it). And even then, its a sketchy subject to bring up without a good reason.  What they can ask you is if you are using any illegal drugs currently. You may even have to take a drug test at some point, so if you are, it may not matter how you answer this question. Just remember, your past is not information you usually have to disclose unless youre interviewing for a government job or a job that requires some kind of thorough background check.  **How to React to Illegal Questions and Discrimination**  If you do encounter illegal questions like these it can be a bit awkward. If the question doesnt seem to have any malicious intent, Michelle Cash at Experience suggests you try to determine what information theyre really after:  For example, if an interviewer asks if you have children, you may deduce that she wants to know if youd be missing work often to care for them. You might simply answer that you have no problem meeting the positions attendance requirements. They may just not be very good at interviews, or maybe theyre new to it entirely. Try to give them what they want without giving up the information you know is yours to keep.  If it does feel like they are being discriminatory, however, or if you think you were denied a job because you refused to answer an illegal question, check with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. There you can file a charge of employment discrimination and learn more about the laws that protect you while you continue your job search. Dont let your interviews turn into a horror story if you can help it, and always go in prepared and knowing your rights.

Maps to the Stars was good. I ended up watching 3 films with the actress whose name I can't spell in a week or so. Stoker (5/10), The Double (3/10 mainly for the set design and lighting) and Maps (6.5/10 - the worst DC I have seen but still more interesting than most films, Julianne Moore is amazing in it)  Also saw Batman Vs. Robin and agree with below. Not the best of the recent movies but still good.
