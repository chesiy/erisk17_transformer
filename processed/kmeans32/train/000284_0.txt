The good news is that the science is impossible for any reasonable person to deny, and Arnold is just one of a growing sea change in the Republican party; [they *are* coming around.](http://environment.yale.edu/climate-communication/article/not-all-republicans-think-alike-about-global-warming/)
I'm with you because you came to the right conclusion, but you got there the wrong way, both anecdotal and mistaking weather for climate.   Weather is obviously an effect of climate and affected *by* climate, but weather  climate.   I'm only cautioning this kind of statement because someone like me, a New Englander, can point to our horrendous 2014/2015 winter and say, "See? Climate change isn't real because it was really cold and snowed a lot."
Every supervillain in the DC Comics New FiftyTwoniverse is placed in an inescapable battle arena. Who wins?   The obvious guess is Darkseid. Does anyone have a better answer?  Rules:  1. This is sudden. Every superhero on earth is teleported into this inescapable arena all at once without warning. It's large enough to have an area of every earth climate/terrain including cityscape, desert, ocean, waterfall, plains, etc.  2. Anyone who generally carries (insert weapon, object, whatever) has it with them. Yes, weapons are allowed.  3. This is a "Hunger Games" style battle to the death, last man standing. That means "no kill rule" characters will kill and must kill to survive. This isn't about the characters' ethics; it's about their abilities.
Also fun, when singing the vocals for the song "Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da," McCartney made a slip and said "Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face", rather than Molly, and had Molly letting "the children lend a hand." George Harrison and Lennon yell "arm" and "leg" during a break in the song; between the lines "...Desmond lets the children lend a hand" and "Molly stays at home..."  Also, Maxwell's Silver Hammer includes Paul laughing over a lyric because John mooned him in the studio after some bad blood between the two over the song.
Fascinating. Thank you for taking the time to elaborate.
Expressions on the mask, Mark Hamill's Joker, comic book references (Jason Todd's crowbar massacre was a nice touch), fourth wall breaking, absurdist Deadpool imagination sequence, and a perfect ending. Couldn't ask for much more.
Even I hated sunsets with water, this shot is amazing! It looks like someone dropped a bunch of giant mirrors all over the earth or it's a bunch of window panes.  Warning: clicking right or left on this picture leads to more pictures, and they are consistently awesome.  Did I see Mt. Fuji?
His change throughout the first book is for the better. He's grown above what society made him and become what society could be.  The only part I would argue is that I believe he was *always* better. From the outset he knows he's being manipulated and hates it. From the very first violent encounter, he doesn't want to hurt anyone, and of course, the people watching his every move *could* intervene, but they don't, and this recurs three more times.  When he's at the lake and Valentine visits, he's done. He's had it with everyone's shit and she has to talk him into saving a world he's not convinced is worth saving. He sees the military that's been manipulating him as his real enemy and refers to them as such. He always doubted that he was on the right side and never felt in control. Valentine later confirms this on Eros telling him that no one is really in control of their own destiny and that she has manipulated him and was manipulated herself.  The end of the book proves what he suspected all along and also proves that he has always wanted to do the right thing and will search the galaxy to do so. The bugger queen obviously knew he was pure of heart or she wouldn't have created the elaborate set-up for her infant queen based on what she saw in Ender's mind.  I see the story as being about an inherently good person who is too powerful a tool not to be misused. He's like some well-intentioned nuclear warhead that doesn't mean anyone any harm.
You're far from alone.   RT critics: 78%  RT users: 76%  IMDb: 7.2/10  IMDb Arithmetic mean: 7.3.    IMDb Median: 7  IMDb Mode: 7  IMDb Metascore: 69/100   Metacritic: 69  User: 7.3  At a glance, one could logically conclude that, on a scale of 1-10, Brave is between a 6.9 and a 7.8, which would land it "good" territory.  Personally, I gave it a 6/10 on IMDb. It was horrible by any means; it just didn't do it for me.

I know the roundabout so well by now when it comes to these issues because this debate rages every single time a mass shooting happens, which is far too often in this country, and while I would like to see something done and I value human life far more than I do gun rights, I have yet to get a satisfactory answer to this one question: what do you do about the guns that are already out there?  [The United States has 88.8 guns per 100 Americans.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_of_guns_per_capita_by_country) That doesn't mean 88.8% of Americans are armed; rather that's how many guns there are in the United States that are owned by somebody. Let's say we went gun control crazy with waiting periods, mental health screenings, background checks, the works. Hell, let's say we banned the sale of any more guns at all making it 100% illegal to sell a firearm. [There are by various estimates anywhere from 270 million to 310 million guns in the United States.](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/06/04/a-minority-of-americans-own-guns-but-just-how-many-is-unclear/) What do you do about all those?   The best suggestion I've heard is a buyback program, but that's voluntary and costly.   What's the solution? Because until we deal with the reality that the United States has an out-of-control gun fetish, any further restrictions are like saying you can't add any more grains of sand to the beach.
it's kind of like how the characters are in kerouac's "on the road" where they were just looking for the next excitement or love affair and there's not really any growth or plot  Another one I didn't find all that exciting and now I'm really getting why. I appreciate the insight and I think I may be well-served by reading a Hemingway biography before delving into more Hemingway, and I may even give The Sun Also Rises another read after all these posts so adeptly defending its merits.   Also, thank you for the explanation of the title. It's actually quite apt now that you've put it in context.  This really has become my favorite sub precisely because of threads like this. I would have read it, not liked it because I clearly didn't fully understand it, and I would have unfairly written off a classic by a master. Instead I've been given a wealth of knowledge and means by which to better appreciate it.  You've all been wonderful to take the time. Thank you.
Yeah, but there's a very negative connotation to the word "prejudice" even though it's really just pre-judging, which is a sensible thing to do in a lot of situations...  We need a word that's for non-racists to have fun with stereotypes, like black people can dance/white people can't dance, white nerd culture versus black gangsta culture, etc. all while keeping a friendly, tongue-in-cheek tone about the whole thing.  Somehow both of these subreddits do this expertly with only a rare asshole downvoted straight to hell.

Captain America's shield is physically indestructible under normal conditions; while cosmic and godly opponents have broken the shield, the shield proves strong enough to absorb Hulk's strength, and repel an attack from Thor's mystical hammer Mjlnir without any visible damage.  It has only been destroyed a few times.   1. Molecule mean destroyed it, but reassembled it. He has absolute control of all matter, so that's a special exception.   2. Dr. Doom broke it, but he had the Beyonder's powers at the time, so he was basically a god-like being with limitless power. The Beyonder proper reassembled it like new.   3. Thanos, already possessing godlike power, was able to shatter it with the Infinity Gauntlet, which is again unlimited power. Nebula fixed it when she used the Gauntlet to undo everything Thanos did.  4. Thor has broken it twice, but required Odinforce the first time and Rune Magic the second time. The first time he fixed it, the second time that particular timeline was undone, so it's like it never happened.  5. Serpent, the Asgardian god of fear and Odin's brother broke it with his bare hands, but he's basically god. It was repaired magically and even stronger now.  So basically, you need omnipotent power and/or magic to destroy it. Due to the enhancements since the last time it was broken, magic is probably useless. Unless you have all the power of god, you can't break it.

I have read and re-read the post that continuously gets the downvoting and it's far from pretentious. It sounds like you're saying I have to dumb down my comments in order for /r/movies not to have their intelligence insulted, which is actually *more* insulting to their intelligence.  A fellow commenter claimed this movie was postmodern. I disagreed politely and explained my reasoning. If that's something considered a "dick move" by the Reddit masses, so be it. Negative Reddit karma isn't going to keep me up at night.  And I'll keep "modicum." It's a lovely word when it's precisely what I mean.
The article you linked was is dated April 3rd.  [Here's one from yesterday.](http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/will-ferrell-kristin-wiig-set-air-date-for-lifetime-movie-20150604)  It's happening.   As for the fucky date:   The female-skewing cable network confirmed the upcoming broadcast of A Deadly Adoption via a massive billboard on Hollywood Boulevard  which included the tagline "The birth of a plan gone wrong." Sources tell The Hollywood Reporter that the movie will air Saturday, June 20, despite the poster saying Sunday.

Well, only because you are just thinking about sex  I'm really not. True, I'm not sexually attracted to men and definitely don't want sex with a man, but more importantly, I don't fall romantically in love with men. I have two or three male friends whom I love, but it's a brotherly love, not a romantic or sexual love. I can't see that working in a relationship, even if he could fix my car for free, which would be amazing...  I like your analogies, though. Definitely laughed out loud at "your balls small funny."

Some suggestions:  * Batgirl (Steph) * Batgirl/Black Bat (Cassandra) * The Atom (as Palmer or Choi) * Dr. Mid-Nite * Hour Man * Renee Montoya (she's been mentioned and pictured as Katie Kane's ex, who has been seemingly unaffected by the non-reboot) * Elongated Man * Azrael (either one) * Plastic Man * Icon   Rocket * Other Milestone characters * Union * Aqualad (Garth or Hyde) * Blue Beetle (Kord) * The Endless * Helena Bertinelli  * Doom Patrol * Metamorpho and Element Woman * Adam Strange * Miss Martian * The Metal Men * Bizarro * Doomsday * Wally West * Donna Troy * Xombi * Nemesis (Wildstorm) * Spartan (Wildstorm) * Red Tornado * Mister Miracle * Barda * The Creeper * Cheshire * Circe * Catman * Scandal Savage * Knockout * Shadowpact * Ragman * Gypsy * Mxyzptlk * Wildcat * Jesse Quick * Manhunter * Guardian * Duela Dent * Bronze Tiger * Rick Flag * Major Force * Freedom Fighters * Jade * Geo-Force * Zauriel * Roulette * Captain Comet * Bombshell * Parasite * Rip Hunter * Goldstar * Toyman * Despero * Superboy Prime * Alex Luthor * Psycho-Pirate * Jericho * Calculator * Cyborg Superman * Kid Devil * Red Star * Mr. Mind * Vigilante * Prometheus * Aztek * Eradicator * Sonar * Evil Star * Lian Harper, Connor Hawke, Mia Dearden * Tempest * Black Alice  * Citizen Steel * Atlee * Obsidian * The Outsider * Canterbury Cricket * Ambush Bug * Ragdoll  Feel free to point out if any of this characters *have*, in fact, appeared. I collect many titles, but not all, so some of them may have appeared by now. This is also not meant by any means to be a complete list.
Cultural Relativism and Universal Human Rights
Which DC series would you like see back on the shelves as part of the New 52?   My picks:  Justice League: International - It was just getting good when they canceled it.  Shadow Cabinet: An old Milestone series featuring Icon, Rocket, Donner, Blitzen, Iron Butterfly, Mechanic, Payback, Starlight, Twilight, etc.  Cyborg: I think it's pretty messed up he was promoted to be a core and founding member of the Justice League and doesn't have his own book.  Black Lightning: Very cool superhero who doesn't get the exposure he deserves.  Ragman: He looks cool and there just aren't a lot of Jewish superheroes. He could even join Batman Inc. and be the sanctioned hero of Israel or something.  The Creeper: An entertaining character who, in the hands of the right writer, can be a great read.  Lobo: Yeah, this character reeks of the 90s, but he's kind of like DC's answer to Wolverine.  Hitman: One of the best comics DC has ever published.  The Atom: The on-again, off-again Leaguer has some interesting adventures.  New Gods: It's kind of a classic, and Orion and Darkseid have already made appearances.
Anyone who can review Batman: Through the Looking Glass? I'm a lifelong fan of both Batman and Alice, so it definitely has my interest!

July 2012 Fail Compilation
Let's see if my fellow atheists like a rare pro-Christian story   Here's a pro-Christian story for you. I drained our bank account today to do laundry and go grocery shopping. I was thirty-something dollars short at the register and the nice, old, Christian couple behind me said that Jesus implores them to help me and my daughter. I thanked them about a hundred times and all they said was "bless you" in return. Some of my faith in humanity has been restored :-)  I'm an atheist and I have been most of my life, and believe me, I know all about the evils of religion and the harm it's caused throughout history and today, but we have to be willing to give credit where credit is due.   Yes, I know it would've been better if they'd done it out of their own personal goodness instead of what Jesus would have them do, but regardless, it was a nice thing to do, and I am grateful.  TL;DR - Christian couple pays the balance for my groceries and I, as an atheist, am delighted.
