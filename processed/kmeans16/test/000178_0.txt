Free forever!1@!!#1!!1   Being free forever will undoubtedly allow for adware/spyware and other 'tracking' happening behind the scenes whether you care about it or ignore it.   OneDrive, Skype, the Store, the Camera app, and a handful of other things are un-installable (disable only lol) permanent back-doors.   Not to mention the forcing of auto-updates, can only pick what ring you want to be on slow/fast and when to schedule reboots. They don't trust anyone, including sysadmins, to get the patches out so they'll do it for you, ya know for 'security'.
It may have bards, but they'll probably be shells of what you knew in EQ/EQ2/Vanguard.   I doubt there will be song twisting, tracking, composing, or other 'flavor skills' like those.
Oohhhh lol
I got that reference!
Hah no shit!
