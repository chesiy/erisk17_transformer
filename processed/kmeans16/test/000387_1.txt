He's helped some, but yeah I think about it often and still feel it's pretty true.  Of course thinking like that also has the qualities of a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Very often, since everyone else is more important than I.
Hair looks amazing, just need to see your wonderful smile to go with it.
Tri-state area is.......................where?
Yeah this post is pretty much a lie.  Ask for live pics, not even half of them have a profile picture that appears to be an actual person.  Saw peewee, a kitten, some sayings, etc.  And you get booted before you can type while they slap each other on the back for "regulating".
*jaw drop*
Hot.
36 [M4F] Ohio/Anywhere - Conversation, etc.   Second of these I've posted, hoping to get more results this time around.  36 year old guy and I'm lonely.  I am white, brown hair, blue/green eyes, overweight (working on it), and am pretty inexperienced at dealing with women in general.  I'm open-minded, like to hear about new things.....told I have a pleasant voice and that I'm intelligent.    I am looking for an ongoing conversation with a woman, let's say 20-40, light skinned, nice smile, medium/long hair.  I'm into larger chested women, you being overweight is not an issue, I just like proportionality.  In fact it really bothers me to find out there are so many good looking women who think they are nothing special roaming the planet.  I don't lie when it comes to my opinion on looks, outfits, hair, etc....   Ideally I'd like to get a lot of pictures from you and you'd want my opinion on them, but really not necessary.  The IMPORTANT part of this is that you WANT to talk and contribute to the conversations, or even kick off a days conversations if we've lapsed due to whatever.  And if you are not interested in talking anymore, let me know...as simple as that.  Interests:  Reading, mostly fantasy.  Series include Dresden files, Stormlight Archives, Codex Alera, Mistborn, etc.  TV.  Supernatural, Workaholics, Sleepy Hollow, Tosh, Grimm, lots of others  Movies.  Behind on movies, but I like comedies and action probably the most.  Video Games.  Guild Wars 2 mostly, but Borderlands, FPS and other type of games only game on PC.  I have a Computer Science degree, and am currently looking into options for going back for a masters in something to open up some job options...still doing my research.  Was looking at jobs for longevity and growth, something like Healthcare, Financial, or possible network security types...so if you're in any of those in the tech side....would be interested in hearing about your experience with them.  The generic descriptions on the web don't do much for me overall.  I have frequent depression, and some experience with other mental health stuff if you would like to talk about those with someone with a little experience it.    Just be genuine, hold up your end of the conversation, and open up a little when appropriate and we'll get along fine.  Like I said I really enjoy getting pictures from women, but no pressure there beyond an initial confirmation photo swap possibly.  I have skype and kik, but do not have video capabilities at the moment for skype video. And really just want to text starting out to meet the personality first, maybe with a picture exchange to at least avoid catfish/troll scenarios.  PM me questions, kik name, etc.  Can go from there.  And if you read this post and it's old, chances are Im still looking.  Guys on here don't get too many replies from these things.
I can relate, Im 36 years old.  Although I will add one big factor of it is feeling alone/lonely.  People really don't want to hear about your shit, or you perceive they don't want to hear about your shit.  If the off chance you do find someone to kind of unload on, and it feels better, they will start feeling the same way too and then either have to get away from you or end up like you.  Then you drop to an even lower level of "why the fuck bother"ness.  Told my parents about my feelings less than a handful of times and I could tell they didn't get it or thought even less of me for it.  So I don't do that anymore.  I really can't say that I believe my therapist understands that deep self loathing, apathy, and loneliness that comes along with everything else.    My best description of mine would be that the universe/fate/god/whatever will make anything I attempt to do fail or turn out worse for me.  As has historically been the case.  So why would I want to tempt that "force" and try to be "better" when I know Im just going to end up worse off.  I'm really tempted to put a "deadline" on my life, get fixed or get dead by age X.  I told myself for years and years I would die/kill myself by 35.  Here I am 36 and any little bit of happiness I have ends up leaving or being taken away.   The whole "behaviorism" aspect of psychology is ....... really the wrong way to approach people who have similar thinking to me.  Because I am an convinced that my behavior is in defense of my life being even worse and that's the only thing that can come of trying.  And behaviorism tries to teach you that your behavior is not working, so you should change type...basically.  It's just complete opposite IMO, you're basically trying to convince an atheist to become religious or vice versa with words.
Alcohol affects your sleep, makes your apnea worse.  Chances are certain pain medications will do the same thing.  They say 15 pounds requires a re-titrate for your apnea....  But if you have apnea caused by your brain, unless the pain medicine is causing it as a side effect...I don't see you being able to stop using the machine.  Different masks can make a big difference, but you might also need to get another test if it's been awhile.  I know I had a thyroid condition and diabetes that got treated and it drastically changed my apnea pressure levels, and I felt like shit prior to getting everything addressed.  Might be something else happening.
While I don't care about H1Z1, since the announcement is mostly here......  I'd just like to point out that SOE announcements have a history of basically blowing smoke up your ass by using language that is very non-specific.  Current path of development and operation could be that they were PLANNING on more micro transactions and it was unannounced yet.  Get some hard promises out of them with specific language so it's not 6 months down the road and you're 100-200 dollars in when you find out they don't intend to honor what you THOUGHT they meant.   Planetside 2 has basically rotted on the vine versus what Smedley was spit balling the game could turn into.  It has lost so many players because of the lack of progress..... buying the same weapon half a dozen times is .......just silly.  And the whole MLG bend, waste of time as it just doesn't appeal to a mass audience.  They never added resource collection or anything that doesn't focus around the FPS aspect despite loads of comments on it, etc.  Planetside 1 last time I played had people obviously cheating, using vehicle immunity hacks or hacks to take the spread out of their weapon shots for pinpoint firing while holding down the trigger.  I'd bring up Everquest, but since it was new and people didn't know what they could expect...I can forgive some BSing there.  Then it continued with Everquest 2......all that voice work that no one wanted and a complete redesign of the Everquest world and classes that was like a game with Everquest name tacked onto it.  Landmark, while interesting for building, just lacks the basic "life"/spark of minecraft.  Haven't heard much of anything about Everquest Next in a long time....so you have no idea what they plan on doing with it.  Only person worse for bullshitting people is McQuaid.
Lovely.
Boobs and smooth nice looking skin everywhere else.   If someone sent me that picture, I'd wanna see more.  I love boobs.
I do most of my book consumption video audiobooks.  And I find music to not add much to the experience and often detract from it.  I think they used to use it to make it easier to fastforward through cassettes and stuff where you could hear the sped up audio and it just kind of stuck.    But.....unless you can prove it's really adding to the situation I'd avoid it.   Also, while it's not asked for.  Pronunciation is something that drives me crazy, even more so if they pronounce the same word differently since you don't have the text in front of you to check wtf they are trying to say.  Oh and characters with similar names, or names that start with similar sounds start to get rather confusing to me when there's a lot of dialog.
I like what I've seen so far.  More requested.
Have you tried sleeping without a pillow?  You might be holding your head differently because of the mask.  Ive found a lot of pillows to be rather uncomfortable with the masks and make me have to lay oddly causing neck pain, etc.  Also your mask shouldn't be too tight, they recommend allowing two fingers between the strap and face easily for "tightness" on most.  I know my back would hurt on CPAP because I wouldn't lay naturally with the mask on due to the tubing and everything else and being afraid of pulling the machine off the table for quite awhile.  The hose management thing took away the fear of pulling the machine off since it would have taken extreme force to do it.
