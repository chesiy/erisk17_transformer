I don't know, that's what's scaring me now. I don't now how they got him, and I don't want to know.
I consider the fact that either they become wolf-men monsters or crazy people to be old hat. I want to update werewolf lore. I had the idea of an academy for young werewolves to learn about control, to use their abilities for the good of mankind. I was also wondering about the human side of being a werewolf and how they could use traits like super senses or speed to help take down criminals.
Felicity and I ducked behind a row of bushes outside the school, hoping that the barbarians didn't see us. Ever since the 'Classification' as people called it, happened, things changed. There was no school system anymore, because everyone was relegated to their class. Mages joined other mages in magic studies and training. Warriors began to work together to protect the streets and develop swords and other weapons. The thieves and rouges began to form guilds and train others in their ways. But some, like me and my friends, worked as a team. Instead of sectioning ourselves off, we joined forces and decided to use our combined abilities to take on quests. Our former math teacher turned Cleric, Mrs. Allison, had given us a new quest. A few mages had taken over the local High School and were performing some dangerous experiments. We'd agreed to the quest and now Felicity and I were scoping out the area.   "I've got two barbarians on the ground in the front of the school." I whispered into a communication rune our mage friend Barry had made. Felicity placed a hand on my shoulder and I looked up and gasped in horror. The front doors had opened and a guy around our age was making his way down the steps, his face hidden by a skull mask.    "Necromancer." I whispered, trying to keep the fear out of my voice. Necromancers were a feared class by everyone. Mages kept their distance and often wouldn't allow necromancers into their training grounds. As a result, Necros as people called them, were outcasts, relegated to living in abandoned buildings. It was a sad fact, but when you can summon zombies, not everyone wants you around. The Necro turned and faced the barbarians. The two warriors looked like they must've been former football players, they were built without an ounce of fat on them. They wore the armor of a mercenary, grey with a red arm band on the left arm, battle axe's at the ready.  "You idiots, the questing party is already here!" he snarled in a high raspy voice. "I scried for them!" He pointed a finger in our direction and launched a ball of blue flame in our direction. I pulled Felicity lower and we both felt the back of our necks become super heated as the ball flew over our heads.   "Open fire!" I heard the familar thwang! of a crossbow string and looked to see Frank, our team's archer, holding his crossbow level; his green hoodie up. I heard a howl of pain and turned to see one of the barbarians on the ground, holding his bloodied knee. Danny and John, our two warriors engaged the other barbarian in combat, screaming like banshees.   "No, no, no!" the necromancer screamed. "Goddamn it, I have to do everything MYSELF!" he screamed, his hands crackling with black lighting. Felicity jumped the bushes and ran towards him, her hands becoming a shade of frosty blue. She flung her fist outward, releasing a shower of icy spikes towards the necromancer, but he acted faster and erected a solid wall of force, shattering the ice. Danny and John had managed to take down the barbarian and were now focusing on the necromancer's shield. Frank's bolts bounced off harmlessly and Felicity's ice magic just slid off.  "It's no good, we can't break it!" Danny shouted, and I grinned. "Stand back! Let me try!" I shouted, drawing out my lute. The necromancer regarded me for a moment and laughed. "What the hell are you going to do with that?" he snarled. I smirked and began plucking the lute strings, weaving the notes with my voice as I began to sing, imagining the two sounds merging as one. Then I screamed as loud as I could, forcing the magic into the shield, completly destroying it. The necromancer was so distracted, my scream had managed to send him flying into a parked car, knocking him unconscious.  John and Danny hoisted the necromancer onto their shoulder after tying him up. "Nice work for a bard." Felicity said jokingly. I chuckled and looked at my lute. "You think I should upgrade?" "Nah, your pretty badass with it." her communication rune vibrated and she squeezed it in her hand.  "New quest guys!" she announced. "An Overlord as been spotted."
My superhero universe is heavily influenced by DC comics and Marvel as well as Hellblazer for the supernatural side. I've got metahumans, mutants, aliens and magic users in every corner of the universe, and that's not counting the Powers of Olympus and Asgard. The superheroes of the universe are similar to the ones on the show Powers, being celebrities and public figures. Sidekicks are seen as a formality, and villains and heroes are seemingly obliged to have young people as either proxies or companions in adventures. I also have a 'Savage Land' expy known as 'The Island', a place where super strong and animal powered villains are housed.  My fantasy world is similar to Discworld, with the ridiculous magic system and crazy characters. The theme of 'the hero has the flu, the janitor or intern's gotta save the world' is a major theme. I've also sprinkled in a dash of Lemoney Snicket's narration and trademark dark humor.   My Science Fiction universe is similar to Korra era Avatar, with a class of humans and Vetari (blue skinned humanoid aliens) with elemental powers.  The technology and style is inspired by Borderlands, with a rustic yet futuristic flare, as is the megacorperations rule over various systems. The protagonist's ability was inspired by DC comic's hero Firestorm.

Two beings in one body- How can I make this work?   Hey Redditors,  I've been working on a science fiction series set in a universe where humanity has left Earth to colonize other planets run by Mega Corperations. To make a long story short, the central character, Eli,  gets the soul of Ziz, the primordial monster of the sky, infused with his, linking them. Now I plan for Eli to be able to use Ziz's powers to fight various villians and stuff, but that's not the problem. I was wondering how I could work the two characters being in one body. Any suggestions?
New webseries idea- Urban Fantasy   Hey Redditors,  I'm thinking about working on an urban fantasy series this summer, to get some ideas off my chest. The plot is about a college Freshman who discovers that he can see the supernatural around him. He's like a 'muggle best friend' of a werewolf and ghost, who go out and battle monsters in human form. It's still in the rough stages, but this is where y'all come in. You guys can throw out ideas and suggestions for the series.   Edit- Sorry, I was going through my notes and the protagonist is going to become the next Grim Reaper, sorry I missed that.
I think it's a mix of a Rank system and a Effect based system. The aforementioned Rat-Man's power would be able to counter almost any power depending on how he used it. But against some powers, by the virtue of being more powerful, like telekinesis or pyrokenesis would be able to kick his butt or kill him.
Shapeshifters in the 14th century.   Hey Redditors! Just started writing a new story set in a new setting. It's set in a alternative version of 14 century Europe, where America is being colonized. Some people are born with a gift- the ability to become one animal at will. However, they keep their ability hidden due to the Inquisition happening at the time. Dinosaurs are also alive in this universe, and are used as beasts of burden and pets, (yes, T-Rexes can be sweet pookies too). That's all I have for now, please feel free to ask questions!
How to give superpowers to a world that didn't have them before   Hey Redditors,  I've been working on a new world for superhero fiction and I need some help. I've been working on a Arrow-type archer named Quiver, a hero with no powers. I want to introduce powers and magic, but I'm not sure how I can do it. Should it be like a particle accelerator explosion like in the Flash tv show?
New world, not sure what to name it!   A Gifted's power is random. In rare cases, a two Gifted parents might have a child with both powers, but the chances are incredibly rare, like albino rare. Pooka's do need training to fluidly change into their animal form, but after about a year of training they can change without a problem. There is a myth that Pookas powers come from the God of the Hunt, Kartan, but in reality no one knows why they can change.  Sometimes a gifted with a bad or ridiculous power can get better with time.
Aquaman has never looked so sexy
Thanks!
Interesting! Very Tarzanish!
The idea is that having archenemy is easy in a world where superhumans exist. Forming rouges galleries would be made simple through the app. Also, I wanted that whole ,'borderline in a committed relationship' that some superheroes like Batman have with some of their enemies. And The Quake and Screech will eventually develop that overtime.
Jungle World   Hey Redditors,  I had an idea for a world where every biome is a jungle, baring the poles. The people have the ability to become their patron animal, like a jaguar, parrot, river dolphin ect. Dinosaur-like creatures also exist. I need your help because I'm not sure where to take this concept .
Happy birthda-vorp

Dyscalculia and College Math   Hey Redditors, Today is a sad day today. I entered my remedial college Math class today and sat down to work on a review. As I read over the problems, I realized to my horror and embarrassment that I couldn't remember what I worked so hard to remember for the entire week. Now, I need you all's help because I've come to the conclusion that these Math courses aren't going to work with my disability. Are there any alternatives or ideas to get around these classes? And how do you guys deal with the anger, frustration and depressiveness that comes with this?
"Hey cutie, you awake?" a high pitched male voice asked me. I felt a hand on my shoulder and my eyes fluttered open. I was in what appeared to be a sort of temple, like the Parthenon. Then I screamed when I saw who shook me awake. A guy around my age, with matching features; black crew cut hair, brown skin and green eyes; but wearing what appeared to be a ratty blonde wig, mini-skirt and ill fitting pink t-shirt. His all too familiar eye brows crinkled in confusion.  "Um, you okay hot stuff?" he asked, stepping back. Another guy who looked exactly like him but wearing a stained lab-coat and googles came up behind him and peered at me.  "Christopher of Earth 2607, are you alright?" he asked in a posh British accent. He waved what appeared to be a metal rod with a yellow crystal at the end over me and smiled broadly.  "Oh great, your body and psyche survived the transdimensional transference." he announced.  "Wait, what on Earth is going on?!" I shouted. Then it hit me.  "Y-you're all me!" I shouted, pointing to the scientist and the man in the miniskirt. They both nodded.  "Well, more like alternative versions of you. Each on of us is like you in someway, but we're also different." said scientist me. "For example, Marshmallow here is a version of you who is a crossdresser." he said, gesturing to the man in the skirt. "I on the other hand, grew up in London and graduated Oxford with my doctorate in Theoretical Physics."   "At twenty?" I asked skeptically. Oxford shrugged. "Yes, but on my version of Earth, everyone is a genius, so that's like graduating from preschool." He turned and clapped his hands. A group of around ten different versions of me came out from behind the columns. One version of me was wearing what appeared to be futuristic Roman legionnaire armor and carrying a energy sword. Another was wearing a dark blue hood and body armor, with a bow slung over his back. A few versions weren't even human. One was a lizard-man, wearing jeans and a t-shirt that said 'Go sun yourself'. A raccoon with black fur and green eyes scampered up to me and sniffed at my jeans leg.   "Aw, hey little fella!" I crooned and extended a hand to scratch his ear but his paw batted my hand away.  "No touching the merchandise pal!" he growled in a New York accent. I looked back at Oxford in shock.   "I'm a raccoon in another universe?!" Oxford nodded.  "Yes, I should've told you that sometimes evolution ensures that humans aren't always the dominate species. Resident of former Earth 56 is a-"   "Wait, you said former Earth. Why?" I asked, a bad feeling growing in my stomach. Oxford frowned and began rubbing the back of his neck, the same way that I did when I get nervous.   "Yes, well that's the problem. Our home Earths are being destroyed. I've been able to pull a few of us from other universes to here." He gestured to the building. "A pocket universe. We'd be safe here, but that's not the point. Right now, the entire multiverse is in danger. If too many alternate Earths are destroyed, the multiverse will lose stability."   "And if that happens everything falls apart?" I finished. Oxford nodded. "Yes, I'm afraid that's what will happen unless we do something fast. We'll need to go to each of our home Earths and begin investigating. If we can find the source of what is causing this 'incursion' we should be able to stop it." I frowned. "Why do you need me?" I asked. "I'm just a colledge student." Oxford smiled.  "We need you because your the bravest one out of all of us." He handed me a silver bracelet with a red gemstone. "That is a teleport back to here. If anything goes wrong, press that gem and you'll be warped right back." Roman me steped forward and placed his hand on my shoulder.   "I will take you to my Earth, doppleganger." he said in a voice that was much deeper than mine. I nodded, feeling slightly intimidated. This version of me was six feet tall and build like a linebacker. A glowing 'rip'  appeared in the air before me. I could see a hazy image of some sort of training room, or was it a locker room, it was hard to tell. Oxford cleared his throat.   "When you are on another world, do not mention anything about your own world. Doing so will have devastating consequences." He said. I nodded and Roman me placed and hand on my shoulder.  "Come. We have work to attend to." he said, before we both entered the breach.
YES!
Magic and technology can match each other. In my setting, magic was discovered around the first time that spears were made, so it's always been a sort of arms race to see who can outdo the other. However, sometimes machines like airships are a fusion of magic and technology. True robotics is a dangerous and new field and thus golems are a suitable substitute. Healing magic is good for when your on the field and need a quick patch up, but so is a bandage. The major reason why magic and tech are neck and neck is because for every magic spell that's researched, a new piece of tech or weaponry is whipped up in a lab somewhere.
"Light Elves" in Pantaria are like hipsters. They hangout in expensive areas of towns and cities, selling their custom jewelry and drinking tea and coffee. Light Elves are stereotyped as 'dicks beyond mesure' for their patronizing attitude towards other races, but this sometimes isn't the case. Light elves usually wear their hair long and flowing, braided with silver wire. They wear the most expensive clothes and favor wine brands 'that you've never heard of' like Yentarian Yak or The Crying Dragon. Pioneers in anti gravity magic, their cities are built to float and are often found hovering just above the cloud layer.   Dark elves are considerd to be really nice in Pantaria. They're similar to Canadians and are polite to everyone, even golems. They don't have a sense of racial tension, and will often try and get races that are at war to party. As a result, many believe that Dark elves are morons due to their ditzy nature, but in actuality dark elves are technical geniuses. Designers of crossbows, war golems, semi automatic mage staves and enhanced swords, Dark Elves cornered the market of weaponry and are the leading minds in weapons. The only two races dark elves have any form of animosity towards are Goblins (due to the weaponry market, Goblin tech is at a disadvantage due to 'accidental explosions')  and Light elves.Dark elves love dwarves due to their mutual love of beer and it's pretty common to see dark elf and dwarf couples getting married.
The LGBT community in Pantaria isn't a big deal. Sure, gay relationships happen, but one's sexuality doesn't matter when it comes to jobs or marriage. For example, a rouge named Nate is comedically omnisexual, wanting to and implying that he's been in relationships with every gender and species in-universe. He isn't seen as a pervert, just odd due to his mannerisms. Gay teachers are as common as heterosexual ones and aren't discriminated against. Yet the central romance plot is between two humans and is heterosexual.  I like to portray odd things as normal and accepting the LGBT community is one of the ways that I do it. Plus I can always have a different types of romance to spice things up.
However, it would be awesome if the community did. Considering how devoted some Yogs are and how skilled they are, I'd love to see concept art or something.
Happy birthday Simon!

Dang dude, nice! I love how Hatfilms are just three harpies. I have an image of them sitting on a rock and throwing shit at sailors. I wish someone would draw a picture of the 'Demi-Yogs' on a ship like the Argonauts.
Story Idea- Wild West with dragons   Hey reddit users, I was walking home from school today and I just got an idea for a novel, I want to throw it out there and see what everyone's reaction is.  So, it's set in Old West America, around the 18 hundreds. Dragons are real and are commonly used for various reasons. The larger ones,(the size of elephants) are used as pack animals for settlers. The medium sized ones (about the size of a cow or horse) are used for transport and mail carrying. And then there are small dragons, around the size of a lap dog or cat, are used for companionship.   Magic is used in place of electricity and is only just being used for utility proposes around the time of the story. Artifacts holding mystical properties are rare and are valued to the point of small turf wars breaking out for one, no matter what it can do. People can also be born with magic abilities, but they're essentially like Mutants, hated and feared.   Slavery was abolished a century before normal and as a result interracial marriage is becoming popular, despite the previous generation being against the practice. However, the civil war has broken out over a two piece powerful artifact found on the North and South border. Since both sides want the whole artifact for themselves, war broke out.   In a nutshell, the plot revolves around a young man named Ezekiel. He was the son of a Native American woman and a African American man, but was orphaned due to an outbreak of a mystery illness that almost killed him. Now, at 19, Ezekiel and a few other orphans from his hometown join the Pony Express. Aside from delivering letters, Ezekiel wants to find out more about the mystery illness that killed his family. He gets his opportunity when his dragon becomes sick and he's forced to stay in a small western town called Griffin Gulch.
Can't you merge the two? The Yogscast tell stories through their series, I think if we didn't at least have a coherent reason as two why the Yogs are fighting, it wouldn't quite have that Yogscast spirit. And an arcade mode wouldn't be bad either, that way it can be something other then story mode or multiplayer.
Duncan and Kim are master and apprentice respectively. Hatflims are young padawan Jedi who are too scatterbrained to find crystals to make lightsabers because they keep shouting "Eat Bantha shit!" at each other. Lewis and Simon are like mission control Jedi and regularly deal with an alien named 'Israphel'.  Hannah is a grey Jedi who sometimes runs into Lewis and Simon. Sips and Sjin are Force sensitive, defunct, clone, bounty hunters without lightsabers. Sips sometimes leans towards the dark side, but Sjin is like the mortality chain who pulls him back to normal. Martyn is like the cool 'older brother' Jedi, who trains the little kids with Zoey. Rythian is a grey Jedi who sometimes works with unsavory characters to get things done, for the greater good. He and Zoey also meet up and hangout in the lower levels of Coruscant with a reptilian alien named T. They meet at a bar called 'Black Planet'  And Nielsy is just the space- pool boy who likes cats.
