I did it's still messed up tho
Update on what I choose   Most of you wont care but for those who do I went to the playoff game and we lost by 1, our coach didn't count how many players were on the court and they got a technical and scored both free throws. To make it more interesting we had .03 secs left on the clock before the foul was called.
Did you any of you guys play dragon age inquisition?   It sounds like you guys would like the game but nobody has talked about it, it's honestly one of the best RPGs of 2014 brought back my rpg feel
Idc who wins I just wanna feel the emotion of pks
If he was white he probably wouldn't have said anything. It's small things that create racism. Sure mentioning he's black was harmless and maybe he was just being descriptive but he probably just mentioned he was black because it's not a generally a black profession and it's isolating blacks as whole. Who cares if he was black or white there was literally no point in saying it. If he cares that much about how it looked he could watch the gif himself.
This was happening before ios8 but thanks for the tip I'll try it
Why is everyone starting with some say?
For me to be able to do the deal do I have to buy the tickets online or can I buy it at the stadium?
I'm American and go to a public high school with very little blacks, they're racist here and I can't go a day without hearing a negative tone towards my skin color and I live on the suburbs. I used to go to a very big high school with many blacks and they are just as racist because I'm darker than most.
Funny things is my brother was sent over seas for a situation I don't remember. Not saying we aren't justified but if your youth doesn't remember why we're fighting isn't time to give it.
Usually fans throw the ball back on the pitch and then there's two balls on the field which makes a delay either way time will be wasted. I believe we should be allowed to keep a ball for memory of the game like other sports do it's kinda unfair that we have to return and only have a cup with a team name to show for it.
I'm confused, can someone explain
