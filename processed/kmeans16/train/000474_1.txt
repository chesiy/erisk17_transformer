Slow news day, I guess
Indeed.
Thanks!
Thanks. I heard that it may be out sometime earlier this week, perhaps because of the staggered release of Developer Beta 3 and the Public Beta.

I’m not having issues with the crashing of the control center tray, but on tray pull-up there is some lag and dropping of frames, which is annoying. So I suppose that I hope for the continued smoothing-out of interface elements as well as the continued improvement of battery life, wi-fi issues (for those who have them), and of course the addition of Apple Music.

I took it for a small number of months as well... Now I feel trapped in a fog of apathy.  Withdrawal was awful but I knew that the medication was doing nothing but poisoning me.  My father is a retired physician (cardiologist) and I must say that having some of the "most accurate" knowledge of Western medicine at one's fingertips is not always such a blessing.  If anything, the few psychotropic drugs I have tried—zoloft (sertraline), celexa (citalopram), and effexor (venlafaxine)—have done nothing but worsen my apathy and general desire to stop living.

Same here. I have found that the medicinal/therapeutic effects also depend on the quality/type of weed, but mostly my mind-state before and during consumption (i.e. if I'm feeling negatively or overtly anxious it's probably not going to be much fun).

If you're in the mood for something a bit different (smokier) than your standard Earl G., Harney amp;amp;amp;amp; Sons' Earl of Harlem is supposed to be pretty excellent.  I've been meaning to pick some up myself, because their teas are pretty damn awesome:  https://www.harney.com/ambessa-the-earl-of-harlem-20-sachets-tin.html  Also—and I am speaking from experience here—Rishi Tea's Earl Grey Lavender is absolutely delicious (and pretty luxurious, particularly with some cream and honey):  http://www.rishi-tea.com/product/earl-grey-lavender-organic-black-tea-blend/black-tea  For something a bit less pricey and in bags (although the flavor profile may not be as "interesting"), here is Rishi's plain Earl Grey in sachets:  http://www.rishi-tea.com/product/earl-grey-organic-fair-trade-tea-bag/tea-bags
