Damn, as someone who's just starting their voice training and wanting to do something like this, I want to know if you need any particular credentials to audition (Masters, how much sight singing experience, etc)?
I will never unhear this
There's no negation, you can have both of them up at once.
YOUR PARTY WAS BAD AND THEY SHOULD FEEL BAD! AND THAT TANK IS A DISGRACE TO ALL TANKS!
This is the most beautiful thing.
That's adorable!
Brilliant.
Commence war flashbacks
Name checks out.
I politely disagree with Pennie not being the "best fit" for the band, because he was a lot better both technically and with understanding the band's dynamic range - better than most people off the street. As a live drummer for them for as many years as he had been, he was a good fit after Josh left and didn't really change the original rep too much. Yes Guns of Summer has a ton of technicality to it, but Pennie used to be in Dillinger Escape Plan, so it's not inherently surprising. For the most part, though, dude just kept time and did his job. Lol I personally think that they started experimenting more with electronic sounds more because of Pennie (dude has a degree from Berklee in Music Production, I believe), which has helped their Afterman sound be what it is, but I think YOTB as a whole was such a drastic "experimental" turn from previous records that most Coheed fans wrote it off. There is some good stuff there, though. Minus the songs that were singles except for Juggernaut. Wasn't feeling them too much.
Tank, can confirm.
What a story, Mark! Haha
I'm rage quitting already...
That's the correct one!
I heard he was actually a very cheerful person and was fairly happy with his life.
Hey ladies
That I7 Dominant to another key?
This made me laugh aloud in public.
Brad.
David Bowie.
^ Vegan. Can confirm.
I'm sorry, dude. :( That's never a good thing to hear. I hope you get to spend as much time as you can with her.
Oh fuck...
Ba, da-dum!
Holy shit, this is amazing.
You know, it's nice to read things like this every once in awhile. It makes me, whom has been at 50 for awhile now, really look back at how far I've come. It can be awe inducing for players that have not yet reached that stage. Thanks for sharing your experiences!
While Tanking during Titan EX with my FC, getting repeatedly blasted off the platform by Landslide. Needless to say, my FC thought it was hilarious as I screamed myself into oblivion on Mumble every time.
What if you tank better drunk?
By higher level I meant 50 on. Should've clarified: I'm aware Shield Oath and Shield Lob both help increase hate, but I've never been particularly good at keeping hate 100% of the time (which I know is impossible, but I need to humor the idealist in me). Flash, as was previously mentioned, only does so much, but I really needed I think to utilize rotating through targets more. Usually I just spam Flash/Halone combo/circle of scorn -- then provoke on any enemies that aren't in range of Flash, but it doesn't always work, and whenever I'm not Tanking I always notice those tanks who more or less keep Aggro 95% of the time.
Clearly they don't.
Forever haunting your dreams...
Boss as fuck.
