Just buy them Magic Mike XXL
fuck you
Yeah, it felt a litttttttle generic, idk what it is, just something needs to stand out, although I actually think the Joker looks good, IMO I think he'll be the best part and everything else won't be as good
That's true
BUT WE HAVE KOBE AND CLARKSON! Guess who hasn't been winning with that backcourt (I know Kobe's been injured), Kobe's got limited time left in the league, and who better to mentor our new young guard. Hopefully we pickup a free agent big to provide a decent season, plus Okafor is basically Brook Lopez without the jumpshot range, good but won't take you to the next level, In Mitch We Trust.
THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU FUCKING SAY SO
Delly trying to rip Curry's arm off

Very true, however I just don't want to see RG3 die
Oh no, we're getting into to the hate circlejerk for a popular movie, not saying you're circlejerking though, however this is the post that will lead to "Am I the only who hated Mad Max Fury Road?" And then "Why Mad Max gave me HIV"
Sorry many, but I meant to say what is the picture a parody of
Well there you go
Something to be considered   We've made quite a few moves improving our defense this off season, which is great, but the only problem is last year, while defense was a major concern, our offense was pretty abysmal. Obviously the team isn't going to be perfected in one off season, plus McCloughan still needs time to gather talent, but barring a breakout from RG3 (please!) were not going very far (which is expected already).

Lol......I don't get it  Edit: Fuck maybe I should read the title next time I'm in a thread

*listen closely
Hopefully he doesn't fall due to some Tropic Thunder and cause Collateral damage Far and Away from land in the Rain, Man that sure would suck to fall out of the Vanilla Sky. Hopefully A Few Good Men will save him so he's not eaten by Lions, For lambs that would be odd, or attacked by a Last Samurai in the Knight and Day......Top Gun.
Losing feeling in my toes.
