Got me also, i knew 2 letter usernames weren't allowed. When i hovered over and gave me a userpage, i couldn't believe it.
Don't know why you are getting downvoted. Thinking it was posted on the entrance of the building?
I actually find it fascinating how some people die. [The randomness of it can be mind blowing](http://i.imgur.com/n5uDgcW.gifv).  warning - link has no blood, just death
You might have active sealife on the coasts and near the surface. You won't have life at the bottom like plants where all the chemicals settle.   This is a problem associated with every delta in the world. It's just worst because the Mississippi river basin covers 47% of the continent of the US.  http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/10/071020090707.htm  Maybe if you actually learn how ecosystems worked, i wouldn't have to sit "behind a keyboard and googling shit."
Without video evidence it would be hard to say. This is why we need cameras on cops. I come from a family of cops and have been abused by cops as well.   I might be part of the anti cop cj but most of it is justified, just like most of it isn't. Why we need video evidence of all interactions of pd and the public.

They probably drive just like OP. Guess growing up in LA traffic has made me more aware of other drivers.   Even just watching the video made me want to slow down seeing the traffic merge. He practically drove into her blind spot.  Don't get me wrong, the PT is completely at fault.   Edit - I will take the downvotes because this was completely avoidable accident.

Constitutional rights or a higher standard? O.C. Sheriff's deputy who refuses to testify in Mexican Mafia case sparks debate
HOWEVER, the video does show several other people attempting to either get the girl off the ground (interfering in police work), or something a bit more nefarious.  Would agree the actions leading up to that point would warrant a show of force, but think he should have defended himself with pepper spray instead. He was putting himself in danger trying to detain someone that was "running their mouth."  The good news here is that no one was hurt.  Couldn't agree more

Only really started to watch hockey more lately, who are the announcers calling the game?  Edit - Thanks everyone for the fast replies. Thought there were a couple more that just did the game itself.
Gonna be a big fight towards the end of this game.  edit - No fight, but what a great game to watch
I can choose to comment or not and also isn't what i get paid to do.  If an officer isn't willing to do required paperwork as part of his job, then he needs a new job.
Kinda mad it isn't the whole video though, /u/GallowBoob i hated you at first but you do post some content that hasn't been seen on many subs. You do post edited content until you beat the horse dry though.
I don't see a problem with this. ^^^^^I'm ^^^^^from ^^^^^LA
On a similar thread someone posted [this video](https://youtu.be/UvluuAIiA50) and really found it fascinating. Someone replied with a HD version but can't seem to find it.
Thank you!
I've never heard anything like it, might get a thunderstorm once every two years, and it will be fun. It sounded far away but it rolled across the valley like it had a vengence. Currently getting rained on pretty good.
Ah makes sense then, as long as he has a job in the area it isn't a problem. The 15/91 is a pain in rush hour and i have spent a decent amount of time on both of them. I live in Ontario, when you said IE i thought more like Riverside/MoVal. That can be brutal to your life if you commute to LA or even the OC.  Edit - i worked a service job so it wasn't always from west LA, it was wherever my day ended, some being better than others. At least if it was bad enough i could get a motel room somewhere and be compensated for it.
