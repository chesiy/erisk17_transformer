Sold 3DS XL to /u/Thromordyn
[USA] [H] 3DS XL [W] Paypal $100 shipped   Hi everyone!  I have a 3DS XL in Blue/Black for sale. It's in ~~absolutely flawless~~ great condition, didn't get it all that long ago. It's still under GameStop warranty (they'll replace any damage no questions asked) until October of this year. I'll include receipt so you can redeem if necessary.   Will come fully reformatted and ready for a new user/system transfer. Will not include a charger. You can grab a USB Charger from Amazon for about $5.   Selling because I got a New 3DS XL.   Thanks for looking!  [Album (sorry for potato quality)](http://imgur.com/a/Snk9v)  Edit: it's running version 9.5.0-22U  Edit2: It looks like there are some small chips right above the camera that I didn't notice until I inspected it closely just now. It doesn't look bad, I didn't even notice them when I first got the console used.   [Album with pics of chips and closeup of the back](http://imgur.com/a/5ZQKV)
I was also kind of hesitant on the MM version but I definitely wanted a New 3DS XL. I heard there was going to be a limited supply of both (obviously much less MM editions) so I went down to Target right before opening to try my luck and get at least one system.   I managed to get a system and my god it is GORGEOUS in person. Pictures really don't do it justice. The gold is dark and understated, and while I usually hate glossy finishes this one looks so damn sophisticated, like the decals are infused with the system. I feel like a matte finish would have made it look sprayed or stenciled on.   If you have even the slightest inkling for keeping it I would highly recommend it.

The term you're looking for is "dress shirt." A dark dress shirt is even less versatile than a dark OCBD. That dress shirt has been $12.90 at Uniqlo for the past few months and there's a good reason why they aren't selling. Don't buy it.
Nope, I actually kinda like it. I think it feels nice and soft like a flannel. I have yet to see whether any of my other ones will get fuzzy like this  since I haven't washed any of them yet.    Mind you I probably would have exchanged it if I had purchased it new. But no it has not stopped me from wearing it.
It sounds like chaos because the timing is off and the brain can't find a "groove" to settle into. Take a look at what /u/Poobslag commented above. The chord changes are jarring and seem out of time with the song.
You should wear light, pastel colors.   If you want to really go in depth, check out [this](http://www.wikihow.com/Choose-Colors-That-Flatter-Skin-Tone) guide to determining your skin tone. Once you've found it, search your skin tone + color chart to find a palate of colors that work well with your specific skin tone.   Note that these aren't set rules! If you find a color that doesn't match your skin tone but you think still looks good on you, rock it! And what color your clothes are relative to you matters very little. What's much more important is your clothes' color relative to each other.   As for what clothes you should wear, check out the side bar's Getting Started Guide and hang around on this sub.   Good luck!

Get a suede brush (or use a firm toothbrush) and brush the shoes to restore the nap. Be sure to brush in one direction, like you're brushing a pet.
Your hair is the perfect type to do something like that in the picture. There is about no way to get your hair to look like that without using product, at least at first, so don't worry about how your hair grows at the roots. You will be able to style it like that.   In regards to clothes, just read the sidebar and hang around on this sub. Go thrifting and experiment with clothing. Remember, fit is king. Slowly but surely your style will develop and you will start looking the way you want to.
J. Crew are definitely one step higher than Uniqlo's. Fit is more on par and quality is definitely higher. Just feels like a more quality piece to me.   I usually grab my J. Crew's at around $30, so they are well worth the $10 difference to me. Whether they are $30 better is up to you.
This list misses the two top recommended colognes by this poster: Acqua Di Gio and Armani Code. I have tried both and I really enjoy them.   Most people think they are really played out, and I agree. I have definitely smelled people using Acqua Di Gio before I even knew what it was. If you go to a more fashionable college that has a lot of bros using it I would steer clear but I go to a nerd school where no one uses cologne so I thought it was a safe bet.

Yes but it's Levi's. Just incredibly inconsistent sizing.
I have the same issue, and I have found that American Eagle shirts are great. Very comfortable around the shoulders and sit perfectly at the waist. Their v-necks are my go-to shirts.   For dress shirts, you pretty much have to tailor.
Don't know what your definition of "not too expensive" is but I got [this](https://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/outerwear/wool/PRD~49025/49025.jsp?Nbrd=J Nloc=en_US Nrpp=48 Npge=1 Ntrm=49025 isSaleItem=false color_name=CHARCOAL isFromSearch=true isNewSearch=true hash=row0) J. Crew University Jacket and I love it.
Interesting. Uniqlo's sizing charts peg the slim-fit OCBDs at a full 1 inch smaller in body width than the flannels. I have both on the way in size small so we will see I guess.   *Edit: Just received my Uniqlo flannels. Two of the three flannels I got fit me absolutely beautifully; the third was overly baggy and fit like a drape. All three were in size small so I guess there are variants between the fit. Once my OCBDs come I will compare the fit to the ones that fit me well.

I'd say social life is really depended on each individual. If you want to have fun and be around people, then you will find people that want the same. If you just like to work, then you can do that.   The social scene is definitely here, and if you want to be a part of it then you can. You will do a fair share of work here but most people take it in stride and have great social lives in addition to the work they do.   Hope that answered your question.
Thanks so much!
Entering. Thanks!
What I think I can do:  Obviously right now I've hurt her so much that any advance I make in the near future probably won't be received well. I think it's to the point where if she saw an email from me she would delete it right away or if she got a letter she would instantly throw it away. So attempting to contact her now is out of the question. I feel like now I just need to remind her that I am still here. My mom thinks it's a good idea to send her something ever one in a while, like a small thing of chocolates or something like it, addressed from me so she knows that I sent it but with no other text. I think this is an okay idea. What do you think?  I still really want to apologize to her for what I did, but again, I don't think she's in the mindset to receive it. The second to last message she sent me was "This is so upsetting you need to stop this I don't want to hear it". Do you think it's a good idea for me to try to apologize, and how would I go about doing that?
I totally agree. Intel does offer more performance but bang-for-buck AMD is much better. As a college student on a budget that's what I went with. I have my 6300 OC'd to 4.7 GHz and it performs very well; at this point the only CPU I'd upgrade to is an i7-4770k, which would require a new mobo and quite a bit more money. I'm happy where I am right now.
There was an incident that happened during Orientation Week at my school... it is now known as the "Brown Leg Incident."  During the first night of school a guy invited a girl to his room, and they began to get down and dirty. His roommate was trying to sleep on the top bunk and got so fed up that he left to sleep in the lounge. One of the RA's walked by and asked him what was going on, and together they went to investigate the room.   While the two lovebirds were alone they had switched to anal sex, and were going at it full force when his roommate opened the door. The shock from the door opening and the ongoing sex caused her to unleash her bowels in full force all over the guy's leg, and due to crappy school food it was runny and full-on disgusting. We all ran out of our rooms from the sound and saw the couple covered in shit and fully embarrassed.   Both students switched dorms after that.

No. Just no.
Pikachu main, here. I use the c-stick for quick down smashes (roll + down smash is king). Whenever I want to charge a smash I use direction + A.  I'd say it's more personal preference than anything, I know some great players who don't use the c-stick at all. I have found, though, that all the insane players I know ALL use the c-stick. So it would seem that it is your friends that are the noobs and you that are the pro.   C-stick is also invaluable for directional air attacks. Pikachu's are amazing, so I use the c-stick A LOT for that.
