Thanks !
I am posting one or two pics a day, i don't have time to edit all of them and i don't do batch processing, so i put out a couple at a time. Then when i have a full gallery i will make a page on my site with whatever history i can dig up.  Go to www.Facebook. com/train_subject246 and you can see what i have put up so far.
I have one more so far on this page, todays post at the top. More to come all week  http://www.freaktography.ca/freaktography-photo-of-the-day/
