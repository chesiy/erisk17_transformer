I guess so, but that doesn't make it any less true
Whoa, I never would've thought of that....
Yeah
Good point

Well what else would they be showing? Special look is pretty vague, and we know there's not gonna be a trailer or footage - it's probably gonna be exactly what you expect. Nothing that groundbreaking or exciting.
At least he can write well - I'm sure the *idea* of the spinoff wasn't his, but the story certainly will be, and that's a good thing.
Really?? That's the movie of his you're saying is bad (which it isn't)?  Not Meet the Fockers? Ishtar?
I wouldn't give up hope completely.  Who knows? This might not even be true. At the very least we'll get some new bits of info, and maybe some behind the scenes footage of even a poster.
Stop.
I guess so
Why not? Up and Toy Story 3 did, and I'd argue that Inside Out is just as good as those.
You're still paying money for it...  Move along
Yeah, that makes a lot more sense than spending $40 on one now instead of waiting 2 months and buying a full set for the same price...
I'm not trying to get you angry, but this was just a pointless post.
Me too - I can't wait!
Why not?
Not trying to tell you that you should like it, everyone's entitled to their opinions, but that's sorta the point -  It's basically a piece of cinematic "art." I know it sounds pretentious or whatever, but you're supposed to interpret it how *you* want to interpret it. There's not gonna be an explanation, because it's up to you to explain it to yourself, if that makes sense.
In reality, all this does is create more hype for the movie. Two screenshots that give away very little information won't make that much of a difference to them.
It's a rare phenomenon, that has occurred a few times in the past few months, most notably at the release of Star Wars 7 Teaser 2, Fallout 4 announcement, and Fallout 4 release date confirmation. It is expected to happen again at the gathering known as "San Diego Comic Con," where new and exciting information about games and movies alike will be unveiled.
Here you go. These are just the first few that I thought of. Don't go with the assumption that every pre-1960 movie is a wacky Three Stooges-esque screwball comedy   Citizen Kane Casablanca  Paths of Glory Ben-Hur The Bridge on the River Kwai The Wizard of Oz Singin' in the Rain 12 Angry Men Gone with the Wind It's a Wonderful Life Rear Window North by Northwest Vertigo Metropolis Seven Samurai Anatomy of a Murder Some Like it Hot On the Waterfront Mr. Smith Goes to Washington Snow White and the Seven Dwarves
The Man Who Knew Too Much
Sure they have a lot in common, but no one should try to point out which one is better than the other, cause there's really not an answer to that.
What?
There was nothing groundbreaking or special about Avatar other than the special effects, which are now commonplace in today's movies. I can't see any Avatar sequels making anywhere near the amount of money that the first one made.  However, Star Wars may be the most popular and successful movie franchise of all time. Like you said, its appeal spans multiple generations all across the globe, and a sequel 10 years in the making is not something that no one cares about. 88 *million* was the number of views that second trailer had in *24 hours*. That's amazing. There is no doubt in my mind that its success will be equal to that of Avatar's.
Then I don't think you understand what makes Star Wars so good and successful. It's a timeless story with relatable characters, something that a lot of movies in the 70s didn't have. Without it's special effects and wide appeal, we wouldn't have any of the blockbuster movies today.
And it was really only Lucas himself that he saw potential in, not necessarily the movie.
I'm sure they would if a popular/critically acclaimed director were to do it - someone like Spielberg or Nolan (not to be circlejerky or anything)
"I really hate the fact that you made me waste the time typing letters into a search engine so I could figure out what you were talking about. I could've used that time to do a lot of other things. I appreciate your comment, but FYI, please try not to ruin my day again."  :/

Actually, Empire Strikes Back is the Pig in the City of Star Wars movies
Theory About Console Names   This is kind of a stupid theory, but I'll share it anyway:  As we all know, Nintendo's first few consoles were the NES, SNES, N64, and the Gamecube. Then, we had the Wii, followed by the Wii U.   See any similarities yet? Well, it's a bit of a stretch, but both the NES and the Wii were succeeded by consoles that had the same name, with an extra letter added. This could be totally insignificant, but could the next console be the Nintendo 128 (or something along those lines) followed by the Nintendo Videosphere? Only time will tell...   TL;DR - theory about console naming
