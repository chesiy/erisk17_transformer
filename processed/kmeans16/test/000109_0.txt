Thank you :)   I've since slowed down the asteroids, but I think it might be too slow now. I just have to find the right balance. I've also increased the firing rate ever so slightly, and thank you for the point abouut the bullets being difficult to see. I'm also thinking of implementing the "hyperspace" mechanic from the original, where you can teleport to a random location on the screen.  Edit: I just looked back at the build I uploaded, and I can't see the the bullets either. This is a glitch, and will hopefully be resolved by replacing the dots I was drawing with proper bullet/rocket sprites.
I'm not sure I want to work on a project with such vague guidelines, but here's one of my [games made in LOVE](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-30/?action=preview uid=34574) anyway.
I think it's been hugged XD

D'oh, street view would be from a while ago .  I believe that the reference to Florida was just a story. That story was the one part of it that seemed too forced/fake.
There's a [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7VQARbRhYA list=PLIvrgpZKZrKim6ga0LD3PBbopdqRQ3Lhf) of all the videos. It's terrifying, idk what's going on D:

Your bot could keep some kind of database with entries for every user it encounters, and the link to their wiki page. I'm not sure how you would go about creating the wiki page, but your biggest problem would probably be retroactively adding users who posted their first post before the bot became active.

Very pretty.
