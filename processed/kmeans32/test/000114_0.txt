The only reason I doubt this a little is because even in such a perfect situation to say that, I would **never** say that to the parent of someone I just broke up with. That just...rude? Excessively rude? Something like that. Also that term hasn't been around for all that long. That would make you still pretty young, right?
I'm in college but I'm not studying physics. Just a course I took, although I do find it more than interesting enough to research in my spare time.
The very definition of National Treasure.

He doesn't speak of having any association with the lord of light until he [ADWD] (#b "is on his death bed"). At that point it seems as if he desperately needs someone to pass on the information so he brings it up. The people he tells just think he's crazy at that point, it's just for the dramatic irony. Personally though, I believed he was right. I can't explain why, just the way GRRM had it play out in the books.  EDIT: Actually now that I think about it, Ameon has talked about it in events prior. I still think he's a more reliable source considering Mel's inconsistency.
I'm not exactly sure what you mean I guess. What is the difference between dying and ceasing to exist? I don't think it matters though, you certainly wouldn't live through it. A big black hole would pull you apart just as much as a small one. If anything it would even do it faster with its extra gravity. No one knows what would happen at the singularity, but you would probably be broken down into pieces so infinitely small that we couldn't even come up with a measurement for them.  I haven't read the article you're referring to though, I could be completely 100% wrong.
In the other side of the spectrum, milk and pineapple somehow work together amazingly just as a snack. Like deceptively good. Locanda Verde has a desert made up almost exclusively of those two ingredients. I *highly* recommend literally anyone try it.

In a totally serious way, Paul Blart... It gets so much shit but I really did like that movie. No one wants to see the second with me and it's been killing me. I might just break down and see it alone.  Also any movie that is the 4th in a series. On Stranger Tides, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, you name it. Sure they aren't nearly as good as the first few, but the nostalgia, the characters, the awesomeness, it's usually enough to make a pretty damn good movie, even if it doesn't compare to the others. Any movie with Jack Sparrow or Indiana Jones is awesome in my book, no matter how shitty the story line.

I'm not a driver, but my friend who has a kid bet me $150 that I couldn't take care of a child. Naturally, the only way to get to the bottom of it was to put a watermelon in a diaper and carry it around all day as if it was a real baby. I think you see where Im going with this. Anyhow, it was a drizzly Tuesday, I was taking Mel to the library to get some studying done. I go down there all the time and pretty much never see anyone I know, so I wasn't worried about being judged. What I didn't account for however is that this was the week of finals. As soon as I looked out the window I already saw four or five people I knew. EVERYONE was there. I made the snap decision to abandon Mel in the cab (I know, I'm a monster). We said our good byes, and that was it. The best part though, was as soon as I exited the cab someone else immediately got in it and it drove away. I can only assume it was an incredible, confusing ride.
Wait...is it though?
Not even close though...
That's pretty good, but I have a friend that can top it...   nbsp;  "What would it be like if the moon was always orange?"  "Why's that?"  "Because that's what color it is right now"   nbsp;  Breaks out into full sprint: "Sorry, my hands got stuck in my pocket and I panicked"   nbsp;  "Oh my god, don't you wish they had dog dental cleaning treats for humans?"   nbsp;  "I've been trying to finish this pizza crust for the past half hour"
The class would just be dying about how far he could go  I did actually. And even if it didn't, you just assumed these things. As we all know, when you assume, you make an ass of 'U and ME'. Or, in this case, just you. So being 'blasted' on basic reading skills is on you. Its funny that you blame me for what you thought was clearing it up later, and then went back to the previous un-cleared up hypothetical scenario you made up in your head. If you didn't get it the first, or second time, I'll say it a third. I nor anyone in that class, have naver made or laughed at a 'borderline stalker joke'. Are you still assuming things?? Read it again, slower this time. Good lord, just get it together.

How is that unbelievable? Can't  you just...point to your head?
A big fat upvote! Gracias, mi amigo.
That had some of the best reactions I've ever seen. Yellow-blue jacket guy, beige jacket man and cool-blue-sunglasses-dude are among my favorites.
Never not upvote this  I got a second opinion as this is not my first language. I might have maybe forgot there was such a thing as a double negative, but lets not dwell on that. Small words used in quick succession occasionally confuse me sometimes...
I don't think you understand, that was a glorious moment in Patriots history. Richard Sherman, the very man who disrespected Tom Brady with his "You mad, bro?", finally got what was coming to him: agonizing defeat in the form of Malcom Butler. I have nothing against the Seahawks, Russell Wilson seems like a great guy, Marshawn Lynch is hilariously unconventional, and I'm a huge USC fan so Pete Carol is and will always be a hero in my eyes. That being said, seeing the cocky sparkle in the eyes of Richard Sherman die a little bit at that exact moment was literally the most satisfying thing I have ever seen.

Also, /r/casualconversations is good for stuff like this! I think. I'm not really sure, I subscribed like two days ago, but give it a shot non the less! Good luck:D

Got to see this at the New York International Auto Show! Un. Be. Liebale. It looks about 3,000,000 times more incredible in real life than in pictures. There is also an Astin Martin Vulcan, Acura NSX, McLaren P1, Lamborghini Huracan, Koenigsegg Agera-the list goes on and on. If you're within a three hour drive away, you MUST go. Don't hesitate.
[AFFC] (#b "Ah ha! It was Tyrion in the Tower of the Hand with a crossbow!")  I've never played clue, am I doing this right?
Did a 360 no scope, hit an RC car, got a triple kill. They saw, but no one else believes me. They probably don't even remember. But I do. That was like 5 years ago. I'll never forget...
I disagree, while it might ruin the mood of the orginal tempo, it captures the essence of the song much, much better. Its a song about breaking away from societal norms and rejecting modern customs (with regard to aggression mostly). The original version dosnt capture that at all. Five Finger Death Punch's does a much better job conveying that message and in a much more powerful way. Bad Company isn't a simple easy going song, its powerful and gritty and rugged. Where Bad Company missed the mark, Five Finger Death Punch nailed it.
What?
"I was walking down the streets of New York, homework in hand, when suddenly a Pterodactyl swooped down and grabbed it right out if my fingers. I would have stopped it but he flew up to the Empire State Building where King Kong caught it and ripped it to shreds with his giant gorilla hands. And then a thousand smaller Pterodactyls flew in and ate all of the tiny pieces. Which sucks because this is like the third time that this has happened."
What the fuck?
