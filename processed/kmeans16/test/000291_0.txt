Holy shit
Apparently [he is a real reverend who's wife died](http://www.kwwl.com/story/29413353/2015/06/25/man-says-letter-telling-him-to-kill-himself-was-put-in-his-car), I find it hard he would write that, but who knows, it's entirely possible. I believe it's.l more likely some idiot troll kid or just some idiot troll left it there to mess with him and hurt the guy.
I don't think that's what's showing at all. I take LD very seriously, I practice it every night and I thought the post was funny. I also made a joke about it.    There's nothing wrong about laughing of ourselves or joke about the subreddit once in a while.
Thanks a lot! I will :)

And then a guy posts a leg with lymphedema and everyone got SJW saying that that wasn't laughing matter, that they wished OP never got that, that it was very rude taking a picture of it... Which they are all true, but come on, it's /r/wtf... You can't laugh your ass off about a 14 year old murdered and then claim humanity in a rotten leg. Jesus Christ.
Meh, no worries. You tried to make it work. Props on you, buddy.
I watched it really high the first time, and couldn't believe what I was watching. The music and the photography are incredible. I cried in the part that plays that Bowie's song, in the bar, where he has to decide whether he goes to the chopper or not.    Upon watching it a few more times I believe it's an amazing film but could've been better with better less comedy-like casting. I don't think Ben Stiller was the best choice for that part.
Hey, I know life can get pretty though sometimes. Hell, I've known lives that were though since they existed. But trust me when I say to you, it can get better. It's in the power of our inmense will and effort, but it sure can. I advice you seek professional help if you haven't yet, and in the meantime, check /r/suicidewatch and /r/depression.    If you may trust the words of a random internet stranger, I promise you you can turn this survival into a pleasant living.
I too am a professional photographer, and what /u/drakeg4 is saying is essentially correct. Use of vigneting should be subtle in most cases (of course there are no unbreakable rules in these fields), and generally an excess of it produces a weird effect. It's mostly used to emulate natural frames and help the composition of the photo by drawing the eye to the desired point, but here I too believe it's overused.    I also see an over saturation of the face colors in comparison with the rest of the photo. Again, to each it's own and I believe the photographer achieved what he wanted, that this is the final result he had in mind. But I also don't like it and I think the argument that the user you replied to have is far from invalid.
I always thought about something in particular that I'd like to share.   We are a very, VERY new species. We're on our very infancy; if we took all the time Earth has existed and compressed it in 24 hours, civilization exists about 4 miliseconds before midnight. Let alone speak about our time since the Universe itself exists. We, in the cosmic scale, exist for no more than a fraction of the blink of an eye.     Yet, we have done so much things. We've traveled to our distant moon, and layed pieces of ourselves in other planets. We have already begin to explore our solar system, in so little time.    What do all things alive want? What's the ultimate instinct of all species? To STAY alive. If you bear that in mind, and also that we have existed for so litte, you'll see that we have yet to evolve a awful lot. I think we'll get to a point in which we'll learn that the best way to survive, is to coopearte with each other. Now, I see that happening in a lot of time, maybe millions of years, but I definitely see that as a real possibility. I believe once we've achieved that point, in which we only wish to survive as a whole species, progress is going to be made a lot, lot faster. We're not as intelligent as we could be, and we know that. Killing ourselves is not the best way to coexist, and maybe one day we'll get pass that.    Now, if you take into account all these things that I said, maybe we could exist for much much longer, and achieve an understanding of spacetime beyond our dimensions. Maybe we'll discover a form of fuel that lets us travel a lot faster and a lot cheaper. Maybe in a long time we'll be able to actually go to other galaxies, to bend and stretch the dimensions of spacetime to our likehood. It's a possibility that I like to imagine.   This is why I think it is actually possible to know other civilizations, to enter other galaxies, to spread our species accross the universe. There's also the chance that before that, we annihilate ourselves in the next 500 years, but I like to believe otherwise. Maybe I'm just a fool, or naive, but maybe this isn't so crazy after all.
You're very welcome! It's crazy indeed. Even more crazy was that in that time of war, our newspapers and TV news channels said *we were winning the war*, when that was absolutely incorrect. Bare in mind, lots of TV shows made 24hs transmissions with entertainment content to gather food and clothes for the soldiers, all of which ended up in the hands of the generals and commandants, and none of the soldiers...   It's a very interesting subject, what happened in Argentina (well, latinamerica to be more precise) around the late 70s and early 80s. Google it and you'll be amazed with the numbers. For example, close to 30.000 people were abducted, tortured, killed and disappeared by the military forces that were in power then, only in Arg. The huge majority of their bodies are still missing, with little to no data about what happened to them.  It's a part of our story that is very present to this very day, because a lot of the babies that were stolen by the same forces then are now adults who rediscover their identities with DNA tests and come foward as "hijos/nietos de desaparecidos" (sons/grandsons of disappeared people). Lots of us (me including) have family members or family friends who've been abducted and tortured. It was a dark time, and a scar that isn't quite cured yet.
Es que claro, me llama la atencin como a vos... *Qu pas con este tipo?* O sea, es un flaco que al parecer lleg lejos con su carrera, en el sentido que logr cosas grosas, fue respetado, tiene una trayectoria considerable, o sea que MUY BOLUDO no puede ser, o al menos eso querra creer... Pero de repente empieza a twittear pelotudeces que se interpretan como el orto y que hasta un mono entrenado se da cuenta que son impublicables. Es raro.
I'm guessing something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/R2yWL7i.gif)
Tonight I couldn't sleep. I need to tell you why.   Well, this is my first post in /r/nosleep. I hope I'll be able to express myself well, since English isn't my first language.           I was thinking, almost meditating, about distances between us people, and how the technology now easily available in every home allows us to connect us and debate instantly about ideas and conceptions. That's admirable, and it's something to remember and charish. Let's not take it for granted.            But also, on the other hand, at the same time a lot of people can not access to this technologies and therefore is marginated from that community, geting behind in human evolution pace. And, a lot of them can not tell us their realities such as we can, and must be in dark places and needing our help, but without getting it. And it made me sad, to think of all those people, departed from their beloveds, kidnapped girls, war prisoners, war victims in the middle east, everyone and everything that you love, gone.                  And that made me wonder about my beloved ones, my house, my things. My life. What if, say 2 to 3 years from now, some political debate gets into a discussion, and then into an issue, and then, into a international complaint, and then, into a war. And its a war with your country, and another very threatening one. And this is ALL from a trouble that to this day, did not exist. Maybe it'll originate tomorrow, but, there's a chance that in 3 years, you will be in that situation.                                              With your beloved ones gone. Imagine your neighrhood, destroyed, your family killed brutally by bombs and bullets of high .cal, your sons and brothers, and fathers, burned and mutilated. Imagine them, with their faces and their voices gone. You knowing that you wouldn't see them anymore, hear them anymore, hug them anymore. Feel them anymore, not ever again. Your pets, all killed as well, you and a few people you know and members of your family survived, but the hunt isn't over yet and you may be the next victim. Or your left beloved ones.                  So, this is something that seems far from true, and we say ourselves that it doesn't actually seems like something that could happen, so, I'm tranquile and I sleep well that way, not thinking about it. But, it could, it HAS, it IS (in other country, to people like you and me), in it WILL BE in some point, another great war.                                  It may not be violent war, with bombs, nukes and airplanes, it could be a echonomical war, which then ends in you and your family in poverty, dying from hunger and great recesion, or a civic war, or I don't know. We, as humans, know that in time, shamefully it's going to happen.                  And now, us that can seen it before it happening, need to do something. But we can't. It's not up to us.                      It's NOT up to us. It's up to THEM.                  And THEY will decide if its your country's turn, my country's turn, or someone else's country turn. We just have to wait and... see.              *Keep a good ear for the bangs and booms.*          EDIT: a word
