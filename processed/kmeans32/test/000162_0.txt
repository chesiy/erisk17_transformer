U.S. Restricted Russian Supercomputer Maker T-Platforms Back in Classified Gov't HPC Business
I, for one, am totally excited for the zombie apocalypse.   The slow churn to economic misery, er, not so much. But zombies! Yes! I can do that.
Note the subheadline....but the retail business is slogging. Luckily every single web service we rely on (from Netfllix to Reddit itself) is feeding the AWS beast. http://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/reddit/

Meanwhile, this is will (sadly) be one of the most popular articles about supercomputing. *sigh
There's an R Package for That
There is a certain sense I get among the supercomputing elite that Hadoop is technology for Web 2.0 companies, that's there's no relevance. It's an unwillingness to experiment. That seems unfortunate because most of their workloads look a lot more like big data analytics (they would cringe to hear that) than they do strict floating point stuff. SDSC is the only real center where development work on this is actually translating into real applications being run...and guess what, they're running more efficiently.

Out in Oregon where all the folks are building their massive datacenters (not supercomputers, to be fair--but just as many cores), this is becoming a huge concern. At some point, they're going to have to move to greener pastures (literally)... not sure how this issue isn't at the forefront of people's minds--don't even see anything about it in the disaster recovery space much. Yet meanwhile, look at the situation the whole West Coast was in... not to be dramatic about it, but this is a growing concern.
The top one with the vertical lines is a typical horn coral--looks like you might have some crinoid bits throughout in addition to the shells. Nice finds, though. The one your brother found is pyrite--sparkly but common too. Still a nice start to a budding collection. Try to check out the area around you there in Ohio for trilobites and other semi-common fossil specimens, they're all around if you know where to look.

This is quite old and wouldn't work, I am imagining, for the few systems there are, which have custom languages developed already (D-Wave's systems anyway)... great find though!
Xeon Phi has only ever been a coprocessor, the point here is that it's the first processor ever to do both at the same time. It can do both--and on top of that, be programmed roughly the same way. GPUs or other accelerators require offloading and serious code hassle. When Landing hits the ground there's no more of that--and it all leverages common x86 binaries, etc. -- The 512 aspect is a minor point. A MAJOR point is also that this thing has memory on package--another first. People don't realize what a game changer this is--for users and Intel alike. Right now it's just important for highly parallel applications in HPC--in 5 years, this will be the new face of Xeon. A serious rival to other contending architectures (ARM +GPU, for instance).
The Future of Accelerator Programming: Abstraction, Performance or Can We Have Both?
There is some serious backstory here. That's all I can say. What's on the coin? Does it burn your fingers when you touch it? *shiver*

I just uploaded some photos of other similar pieces I brought back from the same location (all in one area about 20 x 20 with nothing else like it around--I've looked repeatedly).  See here http://imgur.com/a/LH9zc
An update was just posted a few moments ago next to the older ones. The editors secured a special draft report directly from Oak Ridge National Laboratory and are expected to share full details about peak performance numbers (as confirmed) as well as full specs for benchmarks, application range, processor to coprocessor ratio, memory subsystem and ooo...the interconnect topology. Exciting stuff for the supercomputing world. They note they'll post this around 11 p.m. Eastern or midnight.
Let's you and me revisit this thread in a few years ;)
Pandas Were Delicious, Says Science
Great quote... "data science is a very fuzzy term, but what seems to unite a lot of people is that is theyve come from a lot of different directions and ended up in the same place. It almost feels like this crossroads where a lot of different disciplines actually meet and share and exchange tools and techniques and talk and collaborate."
