He's been hitting way better past couple months. Depending what the ask was, this could be awesome IMO.

Aybar getting a vote! .550 average, 1.495 OPS in the past week. A huge reason our offense has clicked into place all the sudden, Hopefully dropping him back to 5th in the batting order is what he needed. He just seems to feel more comfortable there.  Also, he hit his first-ever homer to CF against the Yankees last week, and it was the winning run. Right after Albert tied the game two pitches before too, back-to-back :)  http://m.mlb.com/video/?content_id=214840083 game_pk=414814

I'm being pedantic? You have given literally zero evidence that such a phenomenon exists, other than cherrypicked anecdotes...which I suppose puts you on the cutting edge of clutch apologists, so congrats on that.  If you just haven't read the stuff, by all means, here's a good place to start: http://www.fangraphs.com/library/considering-high-leverage-performance-and-clutch-hitting/  But, I can't convince you of anything if you're not willing to be convinced.
Yeah that's what I mean by don't disbelieve. Just because the info can't be verified on an anonymous internet forum doesn't mean it's not accurate. Like you said, stuff does break on here every so often. Just like my heart right now.
I think I probably used wording that was a bit too strong when I said "to a T". I also think you make a good point regarding his hesitancy to give young guys at bats; if I had anything to change about his style, it would be that. But I also think he deserves credit for working guys like Kole into the lineup quickly.  Ultimately, I spoke a little too strongly about his team management. I do believe that he does a good job getting out of the way of the team, and promoting an atmosphere that allows them to handle the clubhouse as they see fit. Lately, we've had players on our roster who prefer to go about their business individually, and we've seen that on the roster. But it's been far from a toxic environment.
Point taken, I see what you're saying. You'll never hear me dismiss the value of semantics in arguments haha, don't know why that became a thing. Semantics are important.  Definitely agree that it's the obvious place to upgrade if we're going to do so. I just don't think the situation is as dire as many are making it out to be because the team as a whole has been extraordinarily unlucky so far.   We're 29th in the league in BABIP, 1 point ahead of Boston (who was like 10 points behind us before we played them this past weekend, and they got lucky against us haha). We're hitting the ball well, it's just not getting down for some reason.   We're also 26th in the league in defensive cluster luck (poor Oakland is in last, with luck three times as bad as ours defensively). The fact that we're still pitching pretty well is also extremely encouraging.  The fact that we're still around .500 is pretty great with regards to the luck we've had. I have faith it'll turn around, and when it does, we'll be a pretty good ballclub.
When Shoe keeps the ball down, he's very good. When he doesn't, we get most of this season.  Also that Chapman fastball. Yeesch
Ouch. I saw something about how you guys were really lucky in 1 run games last year, so paying the piper I guess :/  Still, it has sucked to have Zobrist out I'm sure. And Doolittle being on the DL can't have helped your bullpen.
I can understand that perspective. I usually recommend Thousand Autumns as a starting point for Mitchell because it's a more traditional narrative structure, but still has really good examples of a lot of Mitchell's hallmarks (like you were saying).   Thousand Autumns does have an unusual rhythm to its pacing though, so I can see how you'd feel that way.
I picked up *Disgrace* by J.M. Coetzee at a thrift store with no expectations, and it really delivered. A haunting look at a man growing old and realizing he never really figured much of anything out. Devestating, and incredible. Read it in a couple of days.  *A Prayer For Owen Meany* also got me. The novel inhabits such a weird but wonderful (in a weird way of course) world.
The Angels being only 3 games under .500 is actually kind of miraculous and deeply troubling at the same time.   The perceived weakness of the team, starting pitching, has actually been pretty good outside of Weaver, who's "throwing BP out there", as he put it himself.  But the bullpen, one of the strongest in the league last year, has given away 4 or 5 games at least, already. Largely because we have Huston Street in the 9th, Joe Smith in the 8th, and who the hell knows before them. Smith had some bad BABIP luck that caused him to cough up a couple games, and now Street's arm is about to fall off from being literally the only reliable guy so far this year, and it's showing (2 blown saves in a row, including 3 runs in the 9th last night to fumble away a 2-0 lead and the win).  But the most troublesome thing to me is the way the offense has looked. Outside of Trout and Johnny Giavotella (who has been amazing, and is making a lot of Angels fans really glad we traded Howie, which is something I never would've thought possible), the offense is sputtering mightily. Calhoun has gotten it going as of late, and I think he'll stay there. Pujols has had bad BABIP luck, so hopefully that changes. But this is the main reason we're losing games. We had the league leading offense last year. In the past week, we're scoring less than 2 and a half runs per game, and that seems right about our season average. It's a small wonder that we've been losing games with our bullpen. That's what happens when you give a razor-thin margin of error.    TL;DR Angels have sputtered in a big way, but surprisingly because of the offense, not the pitching
8/9 winners: Purdue, Oregon, LSU, St John's  5/12 winners: West Virginia, Wofford, Northern Iowa, Stephen F Austin  Wichita State. Indiana is trending downward and Wichita reeeeally wants the Kansas game.  UNC. Paige is finally starting to play well again. Meeks is getting healthy. If Justin Jackson can keep shooting the ball well, they're a threat to get to Indianapolis.  BYU if they win, Xavier if Ole Miss wins. Xavier is the most overseeded team in the field, and BYU is really good, and playing great ball right now.  Ohio State can win a game, but I'd be amazed if they beat Arizona in the Round of 32.  Davidson could make the second weekend if they catch Gonzaga on an off night, but it's hard to picture them beating Iowa State. That being said, the way they shoot the three, it's not impossible.  I think UCLA will get SMU. Norman Powell is really good, UCLA takes care of the ball, and SMU is turnover-prone. If UCLA stays out of foul trouble, they could do it.  This is the best Gonzaga team in a while. NDSU is good, but man will they have to have the game of their lives to pull this off, especially given the Zags size. That being said, a 15 seed beat a 2 seed just a few years ago by having the game of their lives (Norfolk State over Missouri).  Michigan State. They're peaking at the right time and Izzo knows his way around this month. Georgia isn't to be taken lightly, but the Spartans should be favored.  Providence, Dayton, and OU are all legit teams. Dayton will be playing at home. OU probably has the best team. Providence will have the best player in any game. All three are very well-coached. This is one of the best pods in the first two rounds. I have Providence, but none of these three is wrong (and hell, Albany might get OU in the first round)  I have Nova. They're really really strong. Northern Iowa is also awesome, and a veteran group to boot. Louisville would be dicey. They're not playing that well right now. The 8/9 winner will have a decent shot at getting Villanova, but to me, Jay Wright will coach circles around Johnny Jones or (EDIT: Mark Gottfried, not Steve Lavin. Silly me). Not to mention they're really really good.
Not saying they can't do it, saying that the Sweet 16 at the very least is a tall order. When you say you don't expect to make it that far, but then that you expect to make it further than 75% of the teams in the tournament, it's a confusing contradiction haha.  I was lucky enough to be at both of the Arizona-SDSU games last year (I'm a UCSD alum haha, I live in the area), they were both fantastic atmospheres and fantastic games.
Lol you're very much on the bubble.  EDIT: totally thought that was IU flair.
