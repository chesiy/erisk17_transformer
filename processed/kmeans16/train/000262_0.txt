Bought a 1/16 Revo.   I think I put in $500 this month
Yes it should be in more detail.   It should include the 3.5 at the end.  You can tell at the skinniness in the manual, but if you are going off just by that number you end up with the fatter bearings.   Which I even explained to him in the email.   Which is when he told me this   "You told me what size you needed and I sent them. Don't assume what you need.  Measure them. Every time you assume it coats be 6.00. If you want to measure what you need and send the other 8 bearings back I will be more then glad to get you what you need.  The original kit has the proper size bearings in it according to traxxas " -Ed  So he assumed and took the 8x12 measurement and sent me the fatter bearings.   I told him I need 8x12x3.5 the bearing with the bigger inside diameter. And I sent him a pic of the two bearings showing the difference.    I said I would send those 8 bearings in exchange for the other ones.
2001 lumina.  White color, spray painted blue over the rust and original white with a final white spray paint.  Added rust and dents to give it that Minnesota feel.  Had it for almost 3 years now.   Even made it the whole time without window washer sprayers.  It's an eye sore and if you drive 65mph for awhile you get the nice smell of coolant and jerky tranny shifts. Otherwise awesome in town car and never get hung up in winter.    Anyway to answer the question.   No.
No they have half made cupcakes and you just put the frosting on.  I wouldn't lie about cupcakes lol :)
Good to know.  Thanks
Yes. I think that would be more ideal.  I can't speak for those officers because I honestly wouldn't know what I would do.  I'm sure everything starts happening so fast.  Either way someone died and you can't reverse that.

On a side note I just had a nostalgic masterbating moment on this photo.  Havent seen it for years.

Funny to me.   So don't matter now does it.   And no I get a lot of useful info from this place.   If someone makes a joke around a group of friends does everyone inform that person that they are not funny?   I love the gaming subreddit, but it's not like people are posting jaw dropping facts here.  Mostly repost and some fun OC.
oh come on!
Hate to break it to ya man, I knew I saw her somewhere else.  She even talks about being a model when she was younger in the thread. [http://www.reddit.com/r/gonewild/comments/yladd/first_time_poster_do_you_like_magic/](http://holidaygifgiver.com/media/images/gifs/450/450_original.gif)
My roommate has a pet ferret.  We would do "ferret bombs" where you would run up to someone lying on the couch with the ferret and stick it under their shirt or up their pant leg.  Next you would grab a squeeek toy and squeeze the shit out of it making that god awful noise.   This would drive the ferret crazy which would lead to biting and burrowing.   Man I can't wait for school start again :/
Holy shit do I feel embarrassed for him.  Def not the right move.  We get the apology, but be a fkn man.  Just stop being an asshole and everything will go back to normal.
