Be very careful -- there are very few things where you can make money without spending time at it.  A big step you need to take is to begin looking for a new job if you hate it. You obviously don't want to quit if you need the money, but that doesn't stop you from looking for something else that pays the same or more that you would enjoy more. That seems like a bigger issue than finding a side income.  If you want to transition a side income job to replace your current income, you'll need to spend time on it. There is no way around that. What you probably need to do is create a list of things you like to do so you can get some idea of what type of side income you'd like to try and create.

Yes, that's the hope. I'm really looking forward to it -- I'll get to cross off another point off my bucket list.
I think the major issue on the island is inbreeding that has caused the pack to deteriorate. They went over when the lake froze and just didn't have the opportunitie to get new bloodlines into the pack.

OK, I'm not sure if this will work for new members, but since it's a pretty big one, It's probably worth a try. Panera Bread members have received notice that they get a free cup of ice or hot coffee each day for the month of July. Not sure if those who sign up now will also get it, but it might be worth a try: sign up for their rewards program [here](https://www.panerabread.com/en-us/home.html)
It's actually much worse -- this is the first phase of the study that included 40 of the 118 park units which are likely at risk. The other parks will be evaluated in later phases, so this amount is sure to rise. It also doesn't include the cost of lost land and lost tourism.

I disagree on it's easy. When I walk out a bar in Japan, I have a choice of taking a train, bus or cab home and they will all be there waiting for me within minutes. That doesn't happen in the US and when you've been drinking, preparing for alternative transportation usually is not on the top of your thoughts.  That being said, it's no excuse to drink and drive. I simple made the statement because even with tougher laws, I don't think the US would see the same dramatic drop in people not breaking the law due to it not being easy to find other transportation. But even a small drop would be fine by me.
It just depresses me to no end that of all the Democrats, there is only one that is willing to stand up to Bush and Cheney and try to hold them accountable for what they have done. If what the Bush adminstration has done sickens you, support this guy and help him keep up the fight to get rid of those that don't deserve to be where they are  http://www.december152007.com
