Nah, that team built the sturdiest and most consistent bot in almost any robot fighting tournament, Behemoth, but they had to scrounge something together in 10 weeks because robot wars owns the license to that bot (it was used in toys/action figures in Britain) Radioactive is stupid, but that doesn't make them idiots.
You forgot to mention the blair witch project.
But none of the technicalities you listed stophim from being like batman. He still had a sidekick, is still a detective, (literally the first issue of his new series is about detective work) still uses gadgets, still uses batarangs, still had a batmobile and batcopter, still fights crime in a costume that looks like batmans, still glides around like batman, (and one of the most iconic elements of batmans character is that he glides around) has an insignia costume etc. The stuff about Khonshu is debatable, too, as it's constantly questioned whether Khonshu exists. For a reader that hasn't heard of him, the closest approximation to Moon Knight that they'll have heard of is undoubtedly Batman. Same goes for a lot of other peak humans in the Marvel universe, Like Daredevil and Black Panther, even though they have far fewer similarities to batman than Moon Knight.
It's surreal humor that isn't particularly '80's' too. It's not like there was a popular show in the 80's that had someone be shot through a telephone and had animals represented by humans with animal heads.
The Dub is pretty much unanimously agreed to be better than the sub, even by the creator of the show, and is regarded as one of the best of all time. The show doesn't have a 'definitive' conclusion (it's likely to have a second season) but has two very satisfying endings, and the fanservice is pretty minimal, at least as far as I remember (aside from an OVA, which has two pretty fanservicey scenes.)
I don't really think Annalise was attempting to birth a great one, considering she seems to be a relatively neutral party, and got attacked by the executioners. If we're throwing really off the wall theories up, may I suggest that The wet nurse is actually Velka from Dark souls? She's implied to be more omnipotent than the other Gods in that game, has a strong association with crows, and Marvelous Chester is implied to come from a victorian setting, which implies that Yarnham may be Carim from DS, a land that Velka is strongly implied to be associated with.
Nah, I'm not the Op, and literally took the most recent example. Why does TB feel the need to reply top stuff he's not tagged in? Particularly as he KNOWS that when he replies, his followers will attack and harass that person. (see also, Brianna Wu Matt Lees and those charity streamers, ) he also said [videogames should be apolitical] (https://twitter.com/Totalbiscuit/status/578685278342287360) something that is, in my opinion, extremely regressive, and he decided to get annoyed at Jim Sterling for [posting a trans awareness page.](https://archive.today/KTGv3) Simon has a right to criticize TB, particularly as TB's tweet in question called a random artist a 'moron' for daring to make a pop culture reference.
Just in case, I'm offering up places to the deserter dragons, y'know, if anyone's interested in being in the best damn MGO team in town.
It's a problem endemic of a community that wants you to feel bad for buying AC/Call of duty, yet fetishize every annual release, and complain about every 8/10 review. These guys also don't read games blogs, they just use let's plays, Totalbiscuit and facebook for all their news, which leads to amassive amount of whining about games people  have zero knowledge of.
I've never heard that either, I mean, the ultimate spider woman was gay, maybe that's where it's from?
You sort of need to get a bit further into Peace walker for it to really 'click'. Once you start fultoning a lot of guys the game really starts to open up, and all the controls are designed to make you feel like this incredible badass. I'd also recommend playing through MGS3 again, either  with a guide or having read the TV tropes page. There's an incredible amount of neat stuff you've missed. Just the end alone has about 50 unique interactions, and you can do cool stuff like throwing rotten food around the fear, which'll make him eat and poison him.
Malmo forgets and forgives :(
It sure was an incredible coincidence that the captain happened to be bluffing when Duncan roled a two. I'm glad Duncans SKILL helped him out in that situation
It's got a lot to do with how homogenized main male leads are, the only real roles troy baker and Nolan north can't do are the more 'japanese' style leads. (generally the higher pitched voices and stuff) This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I'd personally like to see more variety in main characters in the games industry than 'white, middle aged male' or 'British white middle aged male'
Are you using a +15 weapon? I manages to kill him in 5 hits with the BSS +15. Alternatively, two hand a weapon, attack once and back off whenever he attempts an attack. (unless he does a butt stomp, keep close for that attack) The only easier boss for me was pinwheel.  Oh, and if you want to level up, go to the painted world and kill the phalanx, and if you want to skip the fight entirely, feed 30 humanity to quelaags sister.
Monsters, director Gareth evens first foray into the genre, and if your willing to delve deeper into Japanese animation you have at minimum the series attack on Titan and neon genesis evangelion, as well as the upcoming (summer) Aldonoah. zero which promises to breathe even more life into the genre.
The movie is kind of lame in general if you're a sci-fi guy. IMO  it would be a much better film if it wasn't so embarrassed to embrace the tropes it rips off. Even though it's still a great film, it's redundant in the face of better written/ more crowd pleasing Massive monster affair.
Eh, it will take quite a while to compile all the various sites/theories/magazine articles that I read years ago, but from what I remember, slusho (the company on logo's and T-Shirts throughout the film) having been drilling in the sea to try to find more of a 'secret ingredient' they put in their drinks, I don't believe it's ever specified, but at the bottom of a sea trench they find clover in a crack in the ground, so it lines up quite well with pacific rim. What is most important is that Cloverfield is essentially a generic kaiju movie, just told from an unconventional perspective, so it's as easy to say 'pacific rim and cloverfield take place in the same universe' as to say 'Godzilla and pacific rim are in the same universe'
In the 60's: The wasp/jean grey/ sue storm In the 80's: essentially every character in the x-men In the 90's: Most of the x-men, oracle starts to develop 2000's: almost every heroine written by Gail simone, particularly Batgirl and Black canary Now: Marvels's pulled a lot of it back, with black widow and Ms marvel being popular. It's worth noting that most of these characters are actually more famous than Wonder woman in the comics community. I'm a big comics guy, and can tell you tonnes about every one of these characters EXCEPT wonder woman.
Don't sweat it, I already did a much larger comment reply or r/anime:   I started watching it pretty much immediately after Kill la kill, and it doesn't hold up well in a character department. The characters in Kill la kill (and Madoka magica, which I watched after getting bored of AOT) are magnetic, genuinely entertaining characters, whereas I only really cared about Misaka in AOT, because she's way more interesting than the protagonist. I also found the battle of Trost to be ridiculously overdrawn, full of filler, and poorly paced within it's own arc and the general series (Erin fights, and nearly defeats, the colossal Titan in the first episode of the arc with barely any fanfare, the political intrigue, and royal guard/expedition force stuff should have been well before the battle of Trost) I also feel that AOT is really unable to provoke 'the feels' in me, because I've seen the 'Mother dies in front of protagonist's eyes' trope so many times in comicbooks, as well as Mikasa's backstory and charactrer being similar to Claymore backstories. (the only other anime I ever watched) I also really didn't feel threatened by the Titans, as the 3D manouvre gear made every character spider man (Very little is shown to make it seem like the gear is ineffective other than dialogue, such as an apparent 1/5th of forces dying during a simple distraction detail)   I don't however, think it's terrible, and it is a good show. I'm just baffled why it's the show everyone tries to convince non-anime people like me to see, when Madoka magica is IMO a masterpiece.
I was mainly talking about how the Makogoori ship essentially implies that the entire series was about Gamagoori working up the courage to ask Mako out. I think the main reason people think Makogoori 'won' is that after the episode premiered, that ship was **dead** without that ONE PANEL in the credits (which I would also points out, means that we never get to find out what the E4 did after the events of the show) Ryumako would pretty much undoubtedly be canon (other arguments would be called heteronormativity to a much greater extent than the current norm) so when people found that image, many on the second viewing, Makogoori 'rose from the ashes.' People started making comics, and the rest is history.
But it's also mentioned that the escalation of Kaiju threat made nukes massively inefficient, hence the creation of the jeagers. I can see why you didn't like the movie, but that's really not a plot hole.
The only way KLK could work as a game is Persona 4 arena/ Jrpg style, however, I've had a fairly good Idea for season 2:  Season 2 would focus around a spec ops's style team, composed of Satsuki, Tsumugu, Uzu, Inamuta and nonon, trying to dismantle Revocs, which is now under the control of Rei, who is attempting to bring about the return of the live fibres (Sorry to Gamagoori fans, but if he was in the series people would focus way too heavily on his character, and, due to the season finale, we know there's no danger to him, also, the season would become about Mako/gamagoori shipping **again**) Ryuko and Mako don't appear, leaving their lives ambiguous. The show would be scaled down from kill la kill, having more grounded action and more characterization, as the life fibers have been destroyed, (comic relief is kept up by bickering, as is the hectic animation) therefore, the series focuses on Tsumugu and Satsuki making elaborate, batman esque plans, and having them usually horribly fail due to bickering and infighting, however, there are clear character arcs and motivations that the characters can undergo, further expanding and elaborating on the core series:  *Satsuki has to reconcile her current life as the 'good guy' with the fact that she was essentially a fascist dictator, and killed innocent people to create a gambit that didn't work   *Tsumugu finds out more about his sister, his reasons for joining nudist beach, and his relationship with his allies, who he has been trained to hate.   *Inamuta becomes generally more developed, taking a more active role in the narrative. He also has the most neutral backstory, since he never really swore the loyalty the other had for Satsuki. He may turn heel.   *Nonon has to deal with her spoiled, rich girl attitude in relation to the others selflessness, she also potentially has feeling for another team member   *Uzu has to deal with his self inflicted social isolation from the other team members, as well as essentially being the dumb muscle. Can possibly have a quest for a rematch against Ryuko.   *In general, the series could do lots of world building, particularly around what cause the world of Kill la Kill to get as screwed up as it is. Furthermore, halfway through the series, Nui turns up alive, meaning the team has to deal with who would essentially be the most powerful being on the planet as regular humans. Alternatively, Nui turns face, meaning the rest of the team has to deal with their suspicion of her.   I genuinely think a series all about badass normal pragmatism would be really cool, but maybe that's just me.
BUT THEY NEVER IMPLIED IT IN THE FIRST PLACE! There's literally no evidence for it, it's not a theory, it's fanfiction, that's not a bad thing, but  there is not a single thing in dialogue or imagery to indicate Nui being male other than Nui not being overly sexualized (and NUI's distaff counterpart, Mako, wasn't either, and we know she's not a boy). **Even if** it was a twist for the OVA or word of God, everyone would say it's bullshit, because there has been no foreshadowing.

Unfortunately this really isn't a subjective thing, people can and will validly flag you for this. Nudity is a valid reason for a copyright strike, just the same as putting up licensed music unedited. Youtube doesn't give a damn about quality of content or power of creators, they just want the PR of saying 'your kiddywinkles won't see no boobs!"
SHADOW OF ISRAPHEL CONFIRMED! TOMORROW AT 6! BE THERE OR BE SQUARE SUCKAS! I for one will be starving myself, waiting tfor the glory that is SOI to nourish me.
I think you should E-mail the yogscast about this. A reddit post called 'a suggestion' isn't the best way to attract attention, but I wish you luck all the same!
Game suggestion for Rythian: Dwarf fortress   OK, so I'm just going to say that I'm a huge fan of Dwarf fortress, and I personally think it's one of, if not the greatest roleplaying videogames ever made. I also love Rythians commentary and gameplay style; namely, cool, competent and collected, letting the games provide any humor, that's why I think Rythian should make and attempt to make a playthrough of Dwarf fortress, after he has of course learnt the game. Here are some of the Pro's and cons of doing a playthrough, for your consideration   Pros: *Dwarf fortress lends itself extremely well to a continuation of the themes prevalent in the Xcom series, namely, the yogscast vs the world. Dwarf fortress is a game where you start with 7 dwarfs, which in the playthrough could be named after various important members of the yogscast. In game, these guys already have incredibly detailed personalities, backstories and abilities, and have to essentially build a fortress to protect themselves from the nasty, sprawling, world. This naturally lends itself to roleplay and hilarious events.   *Exclusivity. Dwarf fortress is traditionally seen as a game that doesn't lend itself to video lets play, and thus, very few lets plays have been attempted. However, at the moment, Rythian is in the exact right place to make a lets play of Dwarf fortress. His fanbase is much older than the 'main' yogscast fanbase, would be more welcoming of this style of game, and, as shown by Prison architect and towns, as well as Civ 5 to a lesser extent. Therefore, you have the perfect set of people to accommodate this game. Furthermore, the yogscast is in somewhat of a lull at the moment, with no major non MC series, Civ 5 is showing the live stream stuff and Sip's has stopped skyrim. Therefore, t's the perfect opportunity to make the next big series, something that Kid's will be talking about in playgrounds and saying "Holy shit guys, did you see the latest dwarf fortress ep where simon lost an arm and a leg? And lewis valiantlly sacrificed himself to save his friend from the Goblins? You have to watch it!"   *You're style of play naturally complements dwarf fortress. You're one of the most serious members of the yogscast, and tend to get heavily invested in the games you play. Therefore, the events of dwarf fortress will easily be able to allow you to show emotion in your lets play. For example, Elves in dwarf fortress will become deeply angered if you offer to sell them wood, sometimes even starting wars. So Rythian would be deeply shocked when elves start turning up his fortress RIDING UNICORNS and lay siege, and waste, to his fortress, even killing his hardened warrio dwarf, zoey Proasheck. Rythian swears revenge, and kills the next dwarven caravan to enter his base. When the next siege arrives, Rythian tries to set up an elaborate lava trap to kill them all, however, this backfires and ends up killing everyone. I mean, How cool would that be? And it doesn't need an elaborate script, it just needs Rythians personality and a copy of Dwarf fortress.   Cons: *Graphics, I'm not going to deny that Dwarf fortress isnt the prettiest game in the world, or the most visually friendly to a casual viewer, however, mods like this [lazy newb pack] (http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=126076.0) Help to alleviate the problem by making DF simple and cleaner, with a better tileset and more utilities.   *Time and work investment, similar to the above, DF takes quite a while to learn how to play, and will require a significant time and work investment to be able to play properly, although it's not as intimidating as it initially seems. But oh, Rythian, the results are glorious   *Down time in videos. When stuff is going hilariously wrong/right in DF it's some of the most entertaining stuff in games, but when You're just managing boring things like stone stockpiles and the like, it can get kind of tedious.  see 3 ways to alleviate this: 1.Play in an evil biome, where stuff is going wrong all the time, and things are always trying to kill you 2. Edit the boring stuff out in videos, although this should be a last resort. 3. Always be working towards some grand goal, such as a 'fuck the world' magma cannon or megaproject, which will help keep the series focused.   All in all,  I definitely think the eventual Pros of this risk will longterm outweigh the Cons, and I think this will be a series people will want to see in their inbox, and look forward to at the end of a long day of work.
Beyond NEVER changes the story, The actions of being homeless are essentially slightly different alternative actions, The ryan choice I was talking about was how leaving the bar in a scene(completely arbitrarily) is the only way to keep the relationship open in the ending. Saving one person over the other in walking dead completely changed scenes and kept them alive for 1 and a half episodes to interact with other characters. In Beyond, you can't even die, and choices are ignored that even the most idiotic writer would think of, for example, the party scene has you choose some music, a action that doesn't matter and only wastes your time, BUT what if, for example, Jodie listened to that genre of music you choose all throughout the game; that's far more meaningful than almost every other 'choice' in the game.
As Duncan stared at lewis from across the table, his eyes painted a portrait, a portrait of a man who led his country to war, with disastrous consequences. A man whose adamant refusal to focus on anything other than science led to widespread famine and drought. "Where did it go wrong?" He mutters to himself, as he takes a laser pen out of his scraggly beard to sign the peace treaty. He hadn't heard from queen sjinsabella of Spain in years, rumor has it she left to the new world with a device to live forever, he wishes he had invented that, but alas,ultimately all that science had led to was a cool pen. If only he had followed religion, apparently he defeated that treacherous Rythian of Crybabia in a mighty battle in a previous life, or so he claimed as the reason for his treachery.  " Are you going to sign it or what, Duncan" said Lewis indignantly, Duncan being little more than a cockroach, wasting his time in its death thoes. "I have a international games in Tesco to attend, y'know **your** city."Rythian began to laugh, a cold, crooked laugh. Duncan didn't say a word, he pressed the laser pen to paper, felt the weight of the dynamite against his chest, and put his thumb over the detonator concealed in the pen.  "TESCO REMEMBERS BIATCH"  Said Duncan as he jammed his hand onto the detonator. As he was engulfed in the ensuing explosion, he knew he had finally won.  In the end it was sips who took over the leaderless byzantine states, and led the world into a better tomorrow,but he knew making the world a fuckin' paradise was only down to Duncans sacrifice.
