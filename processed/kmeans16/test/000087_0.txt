Happy Cake Day, and yes, support has ended for it. I'm thinking at this point I might as well go and update it, because of that very reason.

I sort of rewrote the pack halfway through. Original modlist:  http://i.imgur.com/Yry0BZP.png  It was more based around Thermal Expansion and AE2 - but considering most of the complaints from the original Horizons involved having those two mods, I decided to re-do it to involve Mekanism and etc. The goal was to avoid any gameplay mods in Infinity, unless they had a sufficient number of addons. AE came close to making it back in, but it's been in almost every FTB pack since it was released.

I'll refer to my previous posts for everyone complaining about the inventory: http://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/2wulyv/an_interview_about_pathfinder/cov3tgb http://i.imgur.com/lnGDnV0.png

Well, due to how progression works in Phoenix Reborn, ProjectE isn't accessible 'till late game, and can't be automated until even later. So, at the beginning of the game, I had a huge farm in order to supply me with plenty of toast. I had several machines that I used in various stages, and most of them are still back at the original base where power gen is. I only transferred the frequently used ones to the new dimension.  And I figured that I might as well make it compact, once I started making the void dimension. From there it was pretty simple.
Sweet!
