This US presidential candidate doesnt want to be presidenthe wants to live forever
Somebody had two male lovers - in that person's own words, and   It is believed he was gay.   He was gay, and was a genuine military hero. Both things can and do coexist.
How does trash like this become popular?[NP]   I am referring to the song - [DJ waley Babu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OulN7vTDq1I). How does such utter garbage become popular? Are we so utterly devoid of talent?
Watch [Bakita Byaktigato](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT_fFFFtctk). I linked it to the full youtube video, and while the film is in Bengali, the video is decently subtitled. It is partly a movie about romance, though I will better characterize it as a movie about *leela*.  In my opinion, it is probably one of the best 100 films ever made in India.
There are two important reasons for that - reasons that are pretty obvious, but Mr. Murthy refuses to address them.  Big corporate ideas come from fresh undergraduates, and big scientific ideas come from fresh graduate students (a.k.a PhDs). Rather than the Indian education system, it is the India outside the university that has done its utmost best to squeeze these graduates. Keep in mind that many of India's undergrads are coming from shaky financial foundations. The societal and parental pressure to accept a stable, high-paying job is often immense. There goes your big corporate ideas. Thankfully, however this situation is rapidly changing, and the future does look bright.  When it comes to research, everyone blames the IITs and even IISc, but has anyone ever stopped to ask the question, "How much do we pay our graduate students?" Till a year back it was Rs 15,000 pm. The best and brightest undergrads go to USA for their PhD, and do not return. Multiple big inventions have been made by Indian born US scientists, so yes that talent pool was always there. And even after completing a top notch US grad degree only the extremely patriotic come back to India. An assistant professor at an IIT gets paid Rs 40,000 pm. Even after taking into purchasing power parity, an assistant professor at an IIT gets paid a third of what he would earn in USA.   So Mr. Murthy, here is your answer - you pay peanuts - you get monkeys - not Nobel laureates. But isn't that the way you always ran Infosys yourself?

Didn't they call him Bekar patel?
What is the problem with a piecemeal regulation if it is good? And as regards incentive, you may be different, but in many cases people have to work extra jobs just to make ends meet. The majority of American poor are actually employed, and there are significant populations of homeless, unemployed Americans. A place to sleep, and food to eat is a basic animalistic motivation, when you make people work two to three jobs just for that - then you cannot just wave it away as   In some cases, it's money.  You are confusing **need** with **incentive**. Two very different things.  And as regards, basic income it is still a fringe idea. Not a single mainstream candidate supports it, and yet without it libertarianism is categorically destructive.
Why not Tom Corbett then?
And obviously we have to remember GOP Swiftboating Kerry
You should have added a bit more bombast in your sentence for better effects.
The solution is to reform archaic labor laws. India remains 138 in the ease of doing business rank. Have you ever tried opening a startup in India, and seen the paperwork involved?  Saner labor laws will create more valued startups - internet dependent companies who can push back against the Mittals and the Ambanis. And finally, the GOI has to invest in fiber optic infrastructure. Even in the US of A, the big ISPs do not care about internet infrastructure, and in fact bribe Republican legislatures to purposefully stymie improvement.  Superfast internet, like that in Chattanooga, TN is municipal broadband, built by taxpayer money, in the understanding that there exists a critical mass of startups that will be attracted and will help pay for the infrastructure investment.  Another critical aspect in India is net neutrality. Nobody gives a shit whether you, as a lone consumer care about net neutrality. You have no *aukaad*. And this is not India specific, but is present in USA too. FCC was able to enforce net neutrality, because Obama had their back, who gets big donations from Silicon Valley. And even then, the Republican Party is trying tooth and nail to repeal it - including defunding the FCC. Do you think net neutrality happened in USA because the consumers demanded it? Dream on. It happened because there are internet dependent companies whose valuations rival, and exceed AT T and Comcast, and who can outlobby the ISPs.
You just described my grad school experience till now. I have now cut back on quite a few projects, and am better at doing a cost-benefit analysis. And oh yes, I now understand fully my advisers' saying, "If your work does not lead directly to a publication, don't do it."

Calibri is a terrible, terrible font. At least use Palatino.
From personal experience - stay with an apartment company rather than an individual landlord. And also, may people sublet their apartments for the summer, or for a semester. Subletting is cheap, and you will have the time to search for a good place, if you don't mind moving again.

Every single interaction I had with someone from Pakistan IRL has been overwhelmingly positive. While I was in Boston, there used to a Pakistani-owned pizza place a block from my house which was my thek every evening. Online is however a completely different story however. defence.pk fluctuates between being great and being terrible (it right now is in the terrible phase). However, in my experience a lot of it has to do with moderation. Horus, for example, over at defence.pk is the administrator, and is the primary reason for the mess over there.
Sadly, since he is tenure-track he will probably be railroaded. The Hunger Games that departments play during tenure sickens me.
Nopes, in fact just the opposite - I had Asian parents
1) A great fountain pen. 2) Cool bound lab notebooks with my name on it - like the custom ones from Bookfactory 3) A computer monitor
1) No. You won't if you are doing electronic materials. But having a solid state physics course will be worth its weight in gold. A big misconception about MatSE is that it is chemistry heavy, but unless you are doing polymers you don't need to worry.  2) Many EE profs are in the fab side - ask them. Also do NOT go by US news rankings - they are utter shit in MSE.  3) I am male, but several of my friends are female in MSE, and they mostly say the atmosphere is collegial apart from the obvious overwork aspect.  4) If you really want to go for MSE - I will say go for it. But your GPA will be counted against you. It is hard to get into a good program below a 3.5 unless you have some really good experience that a PI wants or you have publications during your undergrad.
For me it has been working with an untenured faculty in a big, prominent department. They are scared, and under pressure for tenure, and all that is transferred to you with a vengeance.
