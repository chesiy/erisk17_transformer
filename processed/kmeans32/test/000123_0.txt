Blood Meridian - Cormac McCarthy   Just finished this tonight. At times it was a bit verbose, other times beautifully on point, and finally it ended with what can only be described as Heart of Darkness meets the Wild West.  I loved it. Having spoken to a number of people about this one I've discovered that everyone interprets the ending differently. And to that point, even McCarthy won't go so far as to say exactly what happened.  If you've read it I'd love to hear your two cents.
Directions unclear. Both pinkies now broken.
I didn't know this up until a few years ago when a teammate kicked it and I, thinking the play was dead, just caught the ball and tossed it back to the other side. Imagine my surprise and disappointment.
Meh
Dark. Laughed, but dark. haha
A friend of mine texted me from a business trip to Finland earlier this year. "Everyone here is so nice" he said. Then I sent him a story about Simon Hayha and he responded with, "Now I don't know what to think."
Oh no doubt. Just backing your statement up with the fact that tons of guys do get that sort of thing. I remember reading that Pascal hired his therapist after the Hopkins fight, citing the specific instance when in round 10 (I believe) B-Hop dropped to the matt and did push ups in between rounds. Meanwhile Pascal was sitting on his stool praying to catch his breath. He came out of that one, got the therapist, and then beat Bute.   And I'm sure the therapist did wonder for B-Hop. After all, for as much as he talks, his mental game is on point.
Good Lord that was one hell of a KO. Lights out, falls like a tree. Unreal. Thanks for the post.
Looks like they were in an atrium of sorts. Casting weird shadows on everyone.
Ali is quickly becoming one of my favorite fighters. His fight against Abregu showed his power, and his last fight against Santana showed his durability. His face looked like he was hit with a few hammers over the course of the night after that one.   Bradley is elite, as many of you have mentioned, but I really think we'll one day look back and talk about how he just wasn't the same fighter after Provodnikov. Sure, he got his win over Marquez after that, but that BS draw against Chaves started to really show that scar tissue building up on his face. We saw it again just recently in his fight against Vargas. Combine that with the series of concussions he's accrued (I think he closed out the fight against Vargas with one), and you have to wonder how much more his body can take.   I've heard him speak a few times about it, but that Provodnikov fight had him talking with a slur for nearly SIX MONTHS after it was over. No doubt he gained the appreciation of fans and showed he can bang, but definitely a cause for concern.  I like Tim, but if Ali gets the edge in this one then Bradley should really start to weigh his options.
I actually had a similar convo with a buddy of mine after the Matthysse fight. He's going to be the network journeyman after all is said and done if he doesn't start getting a little more selective with his fights. I mean, I don't want to see him taking on tune up after tune up, but maybe two tune ups, then Matthysse. A tune up and then Rios. His tank-like style doesn't contribute much to longevity. As time goes on there will be less and less on his punches. And then what?
What about in those instances where a plot is hard to follow or just a series of broken storylines? Do you find yourself still going for it out of interest in how it all ends regardless?  If I don't find myself thinking about the book during lulls in my day, odds are I'm not too wrapped up in it. One of the more recent books I picked up and put down shortly after is the first Game of Thrones book. Too many characters and too disjointed for my tastes. I know it has a huge fan following, but it's just not for me.
Good Night Dark Knight
When he first joined the league I hated that I loved him (Penguins fan here). I mean, that sliding goal footage couldn't have been played more times during that one five-year run.   But I'm a total Ovechkin fanboy and I'm not afraid to admit it. When the Pens got knocked out this year I found myself jumping on the Caps bandwagon, and not just because they were playing against the Rangers.   I really hope Ovie gets his 'ship after all is said and done. I'd hate to see him go out without one.

Guess that's SI for ya...
I'd imagine what it really comes down to is knowing the audience inside and out. To that point, I mean making sure the content is geared toward the audience, the advertisers are geared toward the correct demographic and more importantly, the quantity of prints are just the right amount. It sounds like a formula that can maintain itself for a while. As far as making a profit, that's another story all together.
Today's library book sale grabs, all for $5.
Start and end with college textbooks, and I'll say you're on to something.
Same goal and six behind ya.
Haha yeah, anything over 100K would help you break even.  But seriously, a fantastic spot for MMPB. Anything from the big names like Clancy, Koontz, Crichton, Rice, Vonnegut, etc. can be had for nothing. My girlfriend and I spent hours in there during a visit in February. The guy who runs it truly does it as a labor of love.
Hah yeah, pretty much. Just don't forget the gambling on horses thing and then you have him down perfectly.
Truth be told, by bookshelf is kind of a timeline of my life. While I've already stowed away the children's books for the day when I have kids of my own, the collection more or less begins with my early interest in sports and fantasy. From there, a number on non-fic books start to pop up along the lines of "Alive" and "Devil in the White City," but there's also a good mix of humor with David Sedaris and Augusten Burroughs as well.   Yes, I have my one shelf devoted to Stephen King and Tom Clancy, another devoted to Kurt Vonnegut and Hunter Thompson, but for the most part I have a pretty solid, well-rounded library that I'm really happy to show off whenever someone says they enjoy reading.
The Stand.
I kind of wonder a lot of the things you ask as well whenever I think of Bukowski. Was he someone that generation could relate to better than ours? What exactly about his style has cemented it in the legacy of writing? And to that point, what style does he even fall under?  I never really found him to be funny. If anything, he portrayed himself as the heroic anti-hero. And by that I mean, he knew he was a horrible person but by virtue of embracing it and pretending to not care what people thing, he believed it ultimately made him cool in the eyes of the reader.  I've never read Ham on Rye, but I've read his Tales of Ordinary Madness and Women. Both were awful. To be honest, I feel one picked up where the other left off. And it doesn't even matter which order you read them in. They're all basically about the same thing: Misogyny, alcohol, drugs, sex, horse racing, fighting, more drugs, more women, more sex, a crappy car, cigarettes, bowel movements, more alcohol, sex again, the occasional note about writing something, alcohol, sleep, a hot bath, and the list goes on.   I don't know why, but I keep trying to find something of his worth my time. I just can't seem to find THAT story yet. At this point, if the works I've read are any indication, I doubt I will.
Ay, go easy on him. It's not pink. Or even bright purple for that matter. I dig it, actually. Nice one, OP.
(A joint project between myself and Mr_Agucci)  Anne shut off the burner on the stove, placed the lid on top of the mashed potatoes and walked it to the dining room, oven mitts on of course. After opening the door with her back to the family, she spun around with the goods in hand, ready to finally sit down for another hearty Wilson Family Feast.  OK boys and girls, dinners served. Pray then eat. Will, its your turn to lead the prayers.  The family bowed their heads in respects around the table, as Will took center stage.  Good food, good meat, good God, lets eat.  William! Anne shouted, the insult of her sons actions lending a crack to her voice. You will say your prayers and you will say them correctly!  Sorry mom. Sometimes its hard to know what to say, but everyone knows a good prayer goes a long way.  Fed up with her sons actions, Anne turned to her husband, who mumbled a quick prayer and kicked off the evenings meal.   Mom these potatoes really hit the spot, but have you ever seen the power of the Quick Chop? Will asked.   Anne looked up from her plate. Im sorry butwhat?  Yeah, what are you going on about boy? his father asked.  Will, unresponsive to his parents comments, continued to chomp away at his dinner, unfazed by the awkwardness that began to hang over the table. Unprompted, Will dropped his fork onto the table and began to sob uncontrollably.  Son, whats the matter? Anne asked.  I must admit I havent felt like myself, more like Im living the life of someone else.  I just dont get the rhyming, Sally, Wills older sister chimed in.   Shush you, said Anne. Your brother is obviously distressed. She turned back to Will and nodded for him to continue.  I woke up this morning as the sun came in, wondering how my day would begin. It felt like any day but I cant recall, all I know is I didnt feel like myself at all.  Then whodidyou feel like? Anne asked.  Will paused and collected his thoughts, eyeing his family nervously as he continued. I know that this is going to sound silly, but I feel like my name once was Billy.  It is Billy, you idiot, his sister said. We just call you Will because Dad goes by the name of Bill.  Do NOT call your brother an idiot! their father shouted.  Whimpering in response to the scream, Auger, the familys black lab and Wills closest confidant, walked away with his head hung low, the smell of his urine stain permeating through the room. Concerned for his best friend  after all, he did name the awesome pup years ago  Will snapped into action.   Powered by the air you breathe, activated by the water you and I drink. Its Mother Nature approved!  A pin could have dropped at the dinner table as every member of the Wilson family turned to face Will.   Hey, at least it wasnt a rhyme this time, Sally said, before realizing the error of her own ways. Damn  What did you say, son? Bill said, all eyes on Will.  I love beautiful wood, dont you?  Well yeah, but  It takes the hard work out of yard work!  Oh God. No. No, please, Anne said, cupping her hand over her mouth in fear of the reality before her.  What is it honey? Bill asked.  Its  HI! Billy Mays here for Flies Away! Will erupted, filling the room with his suddenly-booming voice.   As the family cringed in response, nearing hysteria and fighting the urge to flee, Wills eyes rolled into the back of his head, as a dizzying sense of balance overwhelmed him and sent him face first into his plate of mashed potatoes.   Remember, he mumbled, face first in the mound of food. Nothing absorbs the shock quite like Impact Gels.
Why is it people so easily forget about the serviceable aspect of technology when it inconveniences them?
Honestly outside of checking for hours and skimming the FAQs, I didn't go into the site much. However I heard someone walking the aisles telling her friend that it was started by a guy who ran a bar.  Just checked the website now that I'm back at my desk and came across this video. Didn't realize the guy stocking the shelves was the one who started it all:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRfysnRDCKA  (Also, guess I just answered my own question hah)
First off, I won't even pretend I know what it's like to be deployed or serve in combat, so I'm sure this book hit you differently than it did me. But here's my story:  A company I used to work for had a book drive two days before I left for a business trip, a 14-dayer in the middle of Mexico. Minutes before a company bus was prepared to take us to the airport I noticed my kindle was dead AND I didn't bring the charger. I rushed to the boxes of books we had a drive for, promising to return them when I came back. One of those books I snagged was "A Farewell to Arms."  Now, again, I was never deployed overseas, but this was the longest amount of time I was spending away from my family and friends. The way he describes all of those points you mention - attitude, demeanor, love - hit me in a way that left me thinking about home more than I would have liked. At the same time, a week or so into my trip, I found out a good friend of mine with a one-year-old boy had just learned that he had leukemia. Had I been stateside I would've been in the hospital room that day. But unfortunately the best I could do was get a calling card and call home to chat with her. There was something about the book that related to my reality, even if it wasn't a direct correlation. I too found myself thinking, "Man, life is short - sometimes too short, and we have to really appreciate the time we have with each other." The average person doesn't need a book to find that out, but it was a stark reminder no less.  Also, and I hope I'm not spoiling it for anyone, but I really thought this would be an exception to the Hemingway format. Which is to say, I didn't think anyone would die at the end. But then bam, with three pages left he drops a bomb on the reader. Not cool Ernie. Not. Cool.   Still, what a fantastic read that sent me through an array of emotions at the time.   (And for those wondering, my friend's son has since been in remission for three years and seems to be on the up and up for good.)
Man, tough question. I'll go with my Top 3, although I still haven't read everything he has to offer.  1. Salem's Lot - My all-time favorite, without a doubt. I enjoyed every bit of the characters, including the younger, nerdy kid later in the book who made only a small cameo but somehow struck me as King writing about his former, childhood self. Maybe it helped that I read it before all of the vampire craze from about five years ago. Then again, it's so much better than anything in the past decade or so that's been centered on vampires, so it will be hard for anything in that realm, or anything else by King, to dethrone this as my #1.  2. The Stand - I read the unedited, unabridged version, if only because King prefaced it by saying, "This is the way I meant it to be before editors hacked it up" (I'm paraphrasing, of course). At nearly 1200 pages, you can really get a feel for the parts that editors cut out, because they just stand (no pun intended) alone as this one-off bits. That said, still one of my favorite books by him, and I'm fairly certain I will one day read it again.   3. Misery - I agree with one of the earlier comments about the imagery. King also did a great job of capturing the insanity of Annie Wilkes, famously played by Kathy Bates in the film rendition (which I also enjoyed), and the desperation of his protagonist whose name escapes me at the moment.   All in all, I've read about a dozen of his books, which is to say only 1/3 of his collection. So take my recommendations with a grain of salt.
"Hey Mom? Yeah it's me. Yeah, I made it. OK. See you soon."  Fin
