I told my dad that I needed help and I couldn't feel any worse   Bear with me, I swear it's all relevant.  I'm a 20 year old gay man who is currently living at home, with a very non existent social life. I've never been in a serious committed relationship where I called him my boyfriend. It's always been strictly physical and I just always went along with it, anything to hopefully have a relationship. I know how that sounds and it took me a whole to realize how ridiculous it is. A guy I was seeing last year (let's call him Bill) ended things after 8 months. During the entire time I thought I was going to get committment from him but it ended on heartbreak. I blame myself for anything I did to make him not want me.  Fast forward and we're good friends. I forgave him, and after a nice break from him I got over my feelings for him. He started seeing this girl and I was fine with everything. He said he wasn't into going full on with a guy. This past Sunday he says things didn't work with this girl. It was too bad because he liked this girl. Later on he shows me a letter and says it's to his "boyfriend." My heart actually sunk and I snapped. I went off. He said they'd been seeing each other for two months and then he asked him to be his boyfriend. I was shocked. Literally. He's free to do what he wants, it's just the only that bothered me was that he was so quick to commit to this guy he met two months ago. I spent 8 whole months working on him, trying to get him to commit, and it takes this guy two months.  I went off. I cried in anger, I was sobbing uncontrollably for four hours. What did this new guy do that I didn't? Is it me? After Bill, I searched for someone to make me feel whole, loved and like I wasn't hopeless. I had met this guys in September who I though was going to be the guy to commit and after two months he just stopped talking to me.  I think I have depression and I might be bipolar (all of which hasn't been diagnosed because of how afraid I am to see someone). I've never felt lower. I just get rejected and then Bill commits making me plunge. I almost did something drastic to myself. Despite all the desire to end it, I stomached my pain and reached out to my dad. I didn't tell him about being gay, but I told him I needed help. But he tells me that maybe I should "pray more" because "God will fix it" and that I need to "rid [myself] of the Devil."  I finally got the courage to reach out, and it feels like it was made into a joke. I don't consider myself religious. I'm spiritual but I don't believe in God (if that makes sense). I prayed to him since I was 12 to make the desires for other boys go away, and since I was 15 to make my suicidal thoughts go away and to make me not so sad all the time. People say he works in mysterious ways, but making me and others like me suffer so much is plain cruel.   Despite my dad being an ass, after the holidays, I'm going to make an appointment with my doctor and take the steps nescessary to beat these feelings. Telling him gave me the strength. I just needed somewhere to say all this.
I only met her one time though. I'm confident I won't ever feel sad about her. I feel bad for the ones she left behind, but not her. From what I remember she was a very unsavory person, but now that I know she was depressed, I can see where that image I have if her comes from. I just thought she was a bitter, angry snob. It makes more sense now.

If you find a wound on the animal, there's a good chance that flies laid eggs in the wound. The main concern is that they can carry disease into the animal, making it sicker. In some cases the maggots actually help, eating the dead tissues (which is what they do) and clean up the wound. Doctors do it to humans, but they of course have access to sterile maggots. Still have the animal checked for infections and such. Another theory is that it's bot fly larvae which burrow into the skin and incubate until they are ready to fall out and turn into adults. If you find small holes in the skin at central points (spaced/grouped fairly close together) could be bot flies. Have your animal checked just in case though. Hope this helped.
It's cool. I was just trying to help you out there. It was just really vague. I misspelled explanation earlier and I even checked it before I posted. We all make mistakes. No big OP.
That's true.
My brother is his doppelgnger. He's had people approaching him asking his for photographs and autographs. He just goes with it (for the women) but he says it can be very tiring.

I think he's trying to get into porn or he might have already done so. Anyways, he's fucking attractive now.
Apparently someone already put this up. I didn't see it on here so I thought I was the first person to post it and then learn that someone beat my by an hour. Dammit. So I have to call my own post a repost. I'm so sad..
