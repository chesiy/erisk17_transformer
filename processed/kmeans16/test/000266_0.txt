I'm having a hard time conceiving of what you mean from a hard materialist position. Do you have anything else you could say about it?  It's hard to stay a "hard materialist" once you start contemplating these questions, in my opinion. Basically there needs to be some sort of free agent to make the primordial choice for what exists. It doesn't follow that this is a conventional "God" in any sense, however. It could be more like Schopenhauer's Will.   I'm not familiar with these, what are they? I can also look it up myself of course but I'd love to hear your thoughts if you don't mind.   The multiverse theory holds that this not the only Universe, there are other Universes out there, perhaps with their own laws of physics, etc.  As for the paradoxes of the actual infinite, you can start with Hilbert's Hotel or the fact that the infinite sum of the series 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 +.... actually equals negative 1 if we assume you can actually do "infinite sums" instead of treating them as approximations of very large but finite operations.
Awesome reply, thanks, that's what I was looking for.
His story feeds in to the "became great with no formal training or higher education" myth that people (especially Americans) love. Except that in his case it was actually partially true. Combined with the whole "paranormal" element to his story as I mentioned above, I think this is what makes him a popular favorite more than any "exoticization."
Having had success with Monster, is there any way to distinguish the genuine job offers from the spam? That is the main complaint I hear about Monster, that 90% + of the postings are not legit.   When I used it in my job searches I had zero success. I had one callback, from a company that claimed to be Citigroup but was not Citigroup (instead it was a franchisee that had the right to use the Citigroup name for its financial advisory business), offering a job with no salary, only commission, when the posting gave a salary. From what I hear my experience is fairly typical of Monster.
They may not be allowed, but when has that stopped anyone from doing anything, ever?  I don't know, maybe the chief saying "where's car 6?" and the reply being "Barry took it to Vegas for the weekend" isn't a good way to keep your job.
Why are the people in the first world countries entitled to a better living standard?  We're not, and as far as trade improves the median well-being in the world, I am for it, but a decline in rich-country living standards imperils the political stability of those countries that are crucial to the political stability of the world as a whole (and imperils the whole free-trade project to boot.)   It's stupid policy in the long run. Third-world wages could still have been increased in a more gradual way to converge with those of the first-world without causing an absolute decline in first-world living standards.
We probably don't agree much on politics I'm guessing, but you make some very good points about the counter-productivity of *means-tested* benefits, ones the article and the comments on the NYT site also touch on, namely:  1.) Child care + cost of car + commuting would cost more than many of these low-wage jobs pay.   2.) "Job lock" syndrome where taking a low-paying job makes employers in your former industry far less likely to hire you, and also severely cuts down on your time to search for a job (witness the one guy who was fired for asking for a single day off to care for his dying mother.), and, if you get fired again, the fact that you had a low-wage job even for one day can reduce or even eliminate your unemployment benefits (I know this is true in Michigan.)  3.) "Abuse" of the welfare system by people making phony disability claims. The fact that SDI is welfare for white people is an open secret in Washington. There are counties in West Virgina and Kentucky where almost half of households get the majority of their income from SDI. You never hear the GOP screaming about cutting SDI, and for good reason, it's their most loyal voters who are on it. I know a woman who gets physically disgusted whenever someone so much as mentions Obama, and yet has been on SDI since 9/11 for "psychological trauma" from the event (she did work in New York, but not in the immediate vicinity of the Twin Towers). She uses her income in a so-far futile attempt to launch a singing career.  My solution would be to have a *universal* Basic Income and a *universal* health program and child care, this removing the economic dis-incentive to work that many of these men face, rather than just slashing these programs which will probably only increase the social destruction.  Fat chance of that happening in the current political environment, but one can dream.
I was thinking this myself yesterday. I heard a documentary on in the background with a female narrator and I just knew it was early 80's without even seeing the video quality or hearing much about the subject matter. Turns out it was 1981.   My completely unscientific theory is there was some leftover "hippie" intonation that sort of merged with the "polite secretary" but was then pushed out by the "valley girl" and the "local news announcer" sometime in the mid-80's. I fondly wish for the return of that old female accent but I'm not too hopeful. In fact the default female public-speaking voice seems to have become even harsher and more aloof-sounding in recent years, especially on radio commercials.
Here's what I've heard from some people who are "in the know" (or at least plausibly claim to be):  Far from being "material," our universe is actually a very dense form of spiritual power. The point is to compress it to a level that it basically ignites, sort of like nuclear fusion. Consciousness appearing at the "material" level is the spark of that ignition.
The new age, pseudo spiritualism that is often saddled on it.  Do you distinguish that from traditional belief in the Siddhis, or is it all superstitious accretion to you?  I'm ambivalent - some mediators I respect have claimed supernatural experiences, but I can't bring myself to totally buy it. It's easy to enter into a dreamlike state when you're in meditation. I've yet to see anyone levitate, in other words, and that Discovery Channel "documentary" doesn't count.
Wouldn't surprise me. I think the "changing text" RC is one of the least reliable. There's all kinds of pseudoscience about how the higher reasoning functions in your brain are deactivated during dreaming so you can't read coherently or form complex thoughts. I think there's *some* truth to this (my thinking is always muddy in dreams, even in Lucid Dreams), but the reading stuff is not supported by the first-hand experiences of people on this board and others.
From what I understand, you can get it and be overwhelmed by the pleasure and snap out of it. This happened to me a few times, it wasn't a "freak out," but certainly a sense of "whoah, too much!" In my mind it's closely related  to Lacan's concept of *joissance* (overwhelming or "surplus" pleasure.) You have to "enlarge" your mind before you can handle it.
They have been shown to have a much higher incidence in the US than in other countries, and for different motivations, that is, they are almost never *overtly* political like the recent killings in Norway and France were.  Of course Goh was a sociopath, but you can't ignore the culture either. His most likely inborn mental illness was exacerbated by his cultural context, whereas other contexts would have been more likely to ameliorate it.
Because as any high school politics student knows, political alignments are not on a line (they're more on a grid, with x and y coordinates, etc.)   I'm more of a "horseshoe" guy. I think that grid is Libertarian propaganda: "Wow, look, there's a party that believes in *both* types of freedom!"   Right and left are labels given by American propagandists in the McCarthy era.  No, they come from where the factions sat in the French National Assembly after the Revolution.  His mistake was making his country a socialist dictatorship (communism), rather than a socialist republic.  I don't think he had a choice once he seized power. The majority of the Russian people in 1917 were rural and religious. They would not have voted for Bolshevism if given the chance. A Tolstoy-style religious socialism might have had a better shot.
