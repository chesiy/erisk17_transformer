I'm not sure if you've decided yet, but here is the opinion of a mega fan who has played each game in the series:   Begin with  **Final Fantasy X**.    The graphics are new enough to not be offensive or distracting to modern gamers. The story and world are both beautiful works of art. The cast of characters is unique while each party member still holds traditional JRPG roles. It's the first voice-acted Final Fantasy, so there are some flaws there, but still a great game overall.
Bunny Lovers, help. There is fur EVERYWHERE!!!   Guys, our bunny's shedding is OUT OF CONTROL!   It's not coming out in clumps and she isn't acting ill so I don't think that she is sick or anything. And it has only been going on for two weeks now. We just think that she is shedding her winter coat in preparation for summer. But it has never shed this much.   There are flurries of bunny fur flying around the room. When we pet her, our hands look like hairy gloves. Her cage now has carpet.  **Is it normal for bunnies to shed this much!?**
Ozma sometimes uses our feets as pillows.
pls
It'd probably be cool to equip him with an earpiece, you know, just in case he gets lost from the group and we still need to communicate with him.   *curls up into a ball+single tear*
True on that. I'm just kinda fed up with all the talk I'm hearing about it all. It has blown up into a game that has no females in it whatsoever. It has become a game from a corporation that hates women (not true). Oh yeah, don't forget that Ubisoft is a racist corporation also because every assassin has been white (also not true). They did bring some of it on themselves by their first lousy response. I just think it could have been immediately remedied by a better, more thought out response.
So, guys...this is a great response. If I could up vote you twice, I would do it thrice. Thank you for the detailed encouragement. I have taken it to heart.
I hear you say small and I've seen small before but I'm scared I'm going to be suffocated.
Great questions! There is a great amount of evidence to a historical Jesus, and they come from both believers and unbelievers. Here are just a few examples:  ###Thallus (52AD)  He was quoted by Julius Africanus in 221AD as trying to explain away the a moment at Jesus' crucifixion:   *"On the whole world there pressed a most fearful darkness; and the rocks were rent by an earthquake, and many places in Judea and other districts were thrown down. This darkness Thallus, in the third book of his History, calls, as appears to me without reason, an eclipse of the sun." (Julius Africanus, Chronography, 18:1)*  ###Tacitus (56-120AD) One of my favorites. One of the most trusted historians of his time, wrote:  *"Consequently, to get rid of the report, Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace. Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judea, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome, where all things hideous and shameful from every part of the world find their centre and become popular."*  ###Josephus (37-101AD) Josephus wrote about Jesus most. He was born just four years after the crucifixion. He would have met men and women that knew of the Christ.   *"Now around this time lived Jesus, a wise man. For he was a worker of amazing deeds and was a teacher of people who gladly accept the truth. He won over both many Jews and many Greeks. Pilate, when he heard him accused by the leading men among us, condemned him to the cross, (but) those who had first loved him did not cease (doing so). To this day the tribe of Christians named after him has not disappeared."*  There are other examples as well, including Lucius, Celsus, and the Jewish Talmud. There are paintings of the Christ in certain caves around Rome, when believers had to flee and hide due to persecution. If you look, you'll find some good stuff. Most scholars agree that Jesus lived. The chasm in belief comes when you get to his resurrection.

I hope it was clear that I'm not trying to provide extensive and detailed strategies; rather, I am trying to offer some very generalized and beginners advice from (limited) experience. Seems like you guys are talking specifics, which could confuse a beginner all the more.
Upvoting just so we can get to the bottom of this. Spent the whole night listening to a PUG group discuss the bot's tactics and stats. Ready to unplug the bot and move on.
Looking for a good looking athletic shoe.   Here are the qualities I am looking for in the shoe:  * I don't want to spend more than $75. * They need to be a dark color (preferably black).   * Must have decent/good support. * Must strike a perfect balance, allowing me to wear them to the gym for light running/weight lifting AND out on the town with a casual day-to-day outfit.   Ideas? I've found these so far:  [**Adidas Original Dragons**](http://www.amazon.com/adidas-Originals-Dragon-Retro-Sneaker/dp/B004JXWUES/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top)  [**Puma ZDC82**](http://www.amazon.com/ZDC82-Peacoat-Black-Heritage-Trainers-UK/dp/B00DEENV5K/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8 qid=1394861709 sr=8-2 keywords=puma+zdc)
You make great points. And I think the majority of the discussion regarding other people's finances all has to do with percentages. I do understand that some people can buy a mansion like I can buy a Big Mac. I do understand that.   But just because it is difficult to tell when night ends and day begins doesn't mean that we can't know it's midnight.  I think there is an amount of balance and wisdom in the equation. I am not to judge. And I don't really want to. It was just a personal observation and I am fully aware that I might be wrong.  *P.S. Love having the insightful conversation with you /u/BAMF_3.*
Listen, how about we let the Creator do whatever he wants. If you don't like it or agree with it, stop playing along. If you do like, have fun and enjoy the process.  This kind of "educated whining" reminds me of fast food restaurant workers complaining about how much they are getting paid and so their solution is to go on strike.   Are you kidding me? If you don't like how much you are getting paid, go get another freaking job. There are many people that would work for how much you are getting paid. And there are thousands of jobs available for you out in the world. Get off your lazy butt and go find one.   Entitlement is a nasty monster. I truly hope that the Creator doesn't care what we think. It was his (brilliant) idea to begin the journey. He can affect it in whatever way he deems necessary. Everyone else can either play along, or politely GTFO.
