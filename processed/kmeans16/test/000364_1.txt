Its extremely likely the nexus 4 will see L at this point. The device would have no issues running it, and google quoted the fact that the manufacturer for some aspect of the galaxy nexus' hardware was the reason it never saw an official KitKat update, not because they didn't want to update it. Everyone just chill out, and be patient.
Don't know if its what you were going for but I'm getting a real tron vibe from this and it is AWESOME. Thanks!
Kelpie?
Are you talking about an OTA update or for when the ROM scene reaches 4.4?  If the former, you have to do the following steps:  * Flash stock recovery * Flash latest stock ROM (if you are not already on it)  An OTA update will remove root and overwrite your radio (assuming there is a new one) so you will lose root and LTE.  If the latter:  * Nothing - When you flash a 4.4 based ROM you will have to wipe data though, so you may want to ensure you have some sort of backup.
I've never seen them anywhere other than schoolies is Australia. They're pretty unique. http://mobile.abc.net.au/news/image/4386546-3x2-460x307.jpg
Sorry, you just confused me here;  Nope, sorry  Which implied that what I was saying was wrong. It isn't, stock android does not have this feature.  ninja edit: btw, the feature is system-wide for iOS. It probably has to be hard-coded into the app for the touchwiz implementation. Am I correct in saying that the same feature wouldn't work in 3rd party apps eg. Chrome or Facebook?
Its not really about the physical issues that arise, its a matter of principle. Nothing quite says "I think you're white trash and you don't have the right to touch me." than people deliberately avoiding your hand to place the money on the counter. You have obviously never worked in sales/hospitality because you would understand it if you had.
* Do a nandroid and a titanium backup. * Download desired cm10 ROM and equivalent gapps (remember, cm10 uses a different gapps package than cm10.1) from get.cm or goo.im or wherever else and place on SD card/internal storage * Wipe caches, flash cm10, flash gapps, flash anything else you desire (kernel, init.d scripts etc), wipe caches again to be sure and fix permissions  You should boot up and it should bring up the "optimising apps" screen. If you start getting force closes or get stuck in a bootloop then perform a data wipe and restore only user applications and data from titanium.
The [apk](http://i.imgur.com/osZYS.png) is still there for me in system/apps (its called GoogleEars.apk) but the widget isn't available for me. Cm10 on the latest 10/18 nightly.
I don't have that charger problem. The latest nightlies broke custom kernels, that's correct (I'm using an experimental version of Siyah) but this is not because of a failure on cm's part; they simply updated their code and custom kernels haven't caught up yet. The new code is Mali drivers, which means we are one step closer to having full butter (current 10/10 nightly is the SMOOTHEST this device has ever felt).  I don't know about dual booting. I do recall some people in the forums having issues. Here's a [link](http://sourceforge.net/projects/cm10i9100vsync/files/vsync_sysfs/) to the latest experimental kernel anyway.
Yes, I understand that, I sorta mean "I won this round" and feel ready to win all the ones that are sure to come after it. (see my above comment). Next time I hit a roadblock I feel I'll be able to deal with it much better.  edit: since I believe my depression is the chemical kind, (not due to environmental factors) I understand that it's something I'm going to have to manage for a very long time, possibly the rest of my life. I'm okay with that.
Just off the top of my head:  * Sidebar viewing * Intents (handling reddit.com links like you said) * Sharing a link to posts that aren't self posts * RES-style advanced comment/post formatter/edior
[CM10 nightlies are coming along nicely.](http://get.cm/?device=i9100) It won't reach "stable' status for a while, because they're having trouble with hwcomposer (which means that Project Butter isn't completely there for the SGS2 at the moment.) **Note**; this is for the **International Galaxy S II** (i9100), if you have a carrier variant than you'll have to go to its relevant XDA forum.
Are you sure? Your camera icon in [this](http://i.imgur.com/9zc2i.png) picture doesn't seem to be in that theme.
Have you tried clearing data for Play Store and Google Service Framework and rebooting?
