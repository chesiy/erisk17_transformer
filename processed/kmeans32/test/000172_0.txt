haha i'm pretty sure i wasn't trying to put him under fire. he was, at the worst, polite. the clue in my comment was where i said "i don't know what i expected exactly but it involved more of us becoming best friends".
In the playoffs to boot. Mark it down here. You don't just leave your team of 10 years, go their rival and expect to get a piggy back ride to the super bowl. Fate is going to fart on AJ so hard and it's gonna be so satisfying making it further than him and the colts this year.
Not black enough to scare us white folk though
i'm a pretty respectful guy but if you wear that you're fair game IMO... which is funny because tigers are generally at the top of their food chain (just dad joke things). i have an "only you can prevent narcissism" shirt which people take pictures of quiet often (without asking). doesn't bother me; do unto others and all that. you're never wearing tiger print pants and a tiger shirt to be inconspicuous is all I'm saying.
I thought it was funny but this comment makes me think it wasn't supposed to be a joke.
It's called a loss-leader. No, they don't make money on *that*, but *that* makes them money in the long term (customer enjoys themselves the first time due to the promotion, customer becomes regular customer, promotion works). And now there's a picture of their yogurt on the Internet being viewed by millions of people (which admitadly is only applicable if that yogurt place isn't a franchise).
Holy shit you're obnoxious. Do yourself a favor and re-read all your replies tomorrow when you get a chance to cool off a little.
Why? If you think the Bible Belt is the worst place to be an atheist you're not smart.
the raw beans can be cooked when dry or soaked overnight, then stewed, drained of most of the remaining liquid, and converted into a paste with a masher (such as a potato masher), or pressed through a fine mesh sieve (to remove the skins). Some of the drained liquid, or chicken or vegetable stock, is added if the consistency is too dry. The paste *is then* ***baked*** or **fried** with lard or vegetable oil and seasoned to taste with salt and spices.
S'all good. I understand where you were coming from, and it definitely could have led to personal bashing, but that was never my intent :)
If you're hung over every weekend for the past 7 years like clockwork, you're an alcoholic. It's OK, we've all been there. I've been there. I just don't have the same quick recovery time I used to so I had to cut back. It's not a bad thing, it's just a thing. But yeah I'm probably sheltered for pointing out that you spend 1/7 days a week hungover and that's not an outlier (which for your age range probably isn't - but this isn't just your age range).
Well, it says that exact thing on the song page, so there really isn't much to argue about.  To commence - one of the oldest and rarest tracks from an at the cutting edge of sound - Flume.  from the link.
OK Good. I knew I wasn't going crazy and that I actually had tickets to Wolf Gang and Sir Sly tonight.
ok
:D
I'm not really whining about it just explaining a possible explanation. Yes other countries get shat on, the US just happens to be the biggest target with lots of skewed perceptions which are easily mocked(fat, loud, proud bible thumpers), as well as it's cultural (and geographic) isolation from the rest of the world (American football, imperial system, military expenditures/incursions, healthcare system, tipping, not showing sales tax in the price, ez cheeze, etc.).  On top of all that, it's been the preeminent world super power for the past 70 years. The USSR was close militarily during the Cold War(really a wash because of nuclear arsenals, though with conventional weapons it lagged behind), although it lacked the economy to ultimately compete;  China is currently even economically (or a little bit stronger) but lacks the military projection that allows the US to dictate a lot of policy they wouldn't otherwise have the capability to pull off.  So you've got all these factors rolled into one country that's honestly just a big, easy, slow moving target for global mockery. It can get tired,  and it's like, we're exempt from sympathy because "we're like the rich white guys complaining about persecution".  The best part? When I respond in kind I'm just an ignorant, boorish American.  Oh well, I guess it's the price you've got to pay for your country's disproportionate influence on global affairs since the end of WWII.
Like shit? How was Parsons treated like shit? How was Asik treated like shit? Besides the jersey thing, which could have easily just been a marketing team's really dumb error, how was Lin treated like shit?  Parsons - we would have given him 15 million per and gone over the salary cap had Bosh chose Houston  Asik - besides giving him a contract most people scoffed at (including r/nba), we tried to trade him until the trade deadline last season after acquiring Howard. What else do you want? Teams to not get a significantly better player at the position you already have a guy at?  Lin - gave him a team to run and be the focal point of. Just happened to pick up a much better player later that offseason. Their skill sets overlapped.  You people seem to think that this is a church peewee league or something.
I've been on reddit for almost 4 years and I think your comment is like the 5th I've upvoted, so kudos on that.
satire?
It's hard ya know. Rockets were probably the second most criticized franchise this past season, with these same types of comments appear  over and over. Rockets fans are human and sometimes it gets to us. I try not to let it get to me but I'll be honest, sometimes it does and sometimes I miss when the Rockets were everyone's favorite little team a couple seasons ago.   I guess that's what happens when you acquire devisive superstars.
snap
lol!
It addresses the fact that less intelligent individuals tend I reproduce more than intelligent ones.  Is this a fact? I think the corollary to higher amount of offspring is socio-economic, not intelligence. Also, smart people predict we'll hit peak population in 50 years or so.
Which is fair, but I did admit that his time in LA was an unmitigated disaster.   Dude is busting post moves during the playoffs I didn't even know he had when he was playing for LA.  That's because he didn't have them then. He's been working very closely with Hakeem pretty much since he arrived in Houston and you can definitely see Dream's influence on Howard's post moves. Another sign of his dedication to improvement and his game.
A targ bastard repopulating the others? A song of ice and fire. Crastor for AA confirmed.
There is a difference between a collection of knuckleheads booing jeremy lin and the arena booing him. In this case, I'm sure there were a few people in the stands booing Lin directly, however the majority of the boos that people are referring to were directed at a combination of Mo Williams checking in and a bad (not bad) call being replayed on the screen.  I just love how this completely unsubstantiated bullshit has leaked into every fucking thread that is related to the rockets.
It's like, if Lin makes one bad play, he's shit, yet Harden can make ten bad plays in a quarter and he's just having an off night.  it's ok man, you guys do enough hating on harden already, we're just balancing it out.  also you aren't paying attention too much because people are pretty polar extreme about harden whichever way he is playing.  i was at the first game, it was the 2nd quarter, i went to the bathroom and a guy next to me was talking to his buddy about how shit harden was.  this was the first game and the first half wasn't even over.  you just have a filtered version of reality that support a narrative you want to see.
Booing a replay on the tv screen actually.
Yah but I know of you.
No they don't. I get them on average within 10-15 minutes on the weekends. Have never waited an hour. Montrose/Heights/Midtown area.
