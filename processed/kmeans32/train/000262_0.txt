I only saw tiger when I read the headline and I thought the thumbnail looked like some new crazy tiger species eye made from carbon fiber.  I was stoked.  Well, I'm a 16th level ranger in advanced dungeons and dragons.

We may not have Victoria anymore, but we still got Katie
He does not like his harness.

Yes. I think that would be more ideal.  I can't speak for those officers because I honestly wouldn't know what I would do.  I'm sure everything starts happening so fast.  Either way someone died and you can't reverse that.
No problem
Monster has been doing this since 07.   I was on SKSK bus and they had to leave my town.    I had a long drive ahead of me and I figured I grab one of their Monsters.   3 hours into my drive I crack open the monster and taste warm tinny water.     Sucks to suck

I'm an upstairs neighbor and I always drop my metal oney? sp.  and the tv remote and a lighter.    Sometimes a glass pinchy too.     I always feel bad for the girl below me, but she has a black lab that barks from 8am to 2pm.   Really sucks when I have a day off of work and try to get some homework done or relax.     Can't say anything to the landlord tho cuz I have two dogs which I'm not paying for.   I think they know anyway.    Aw well
No he just experimented and had fun like every other person in their 20's.   But when you are a public figure no one likes dealing with those questions.
Thanks Obama
Once with a couple of hungry friends the waitress came back to ask how the food was and my buddy just finished his meal.    This is how she asked.      "Soo how-oly shit you're done."    He just laughed.
My buddy wanted to show of his new 3 wheeler

I should of been more clear on this.   This is for only walk-ins I will do this.  We usually have a full day of schedule appt, but you get a couple walk-ins and most will set up a next day appt.   Some customers are either out of town or just can't get an appt set up.  These are the customer that will do a quick (15-30min) inspection.   Everyone should be charged the min, but I gift the nice patient ones.
*Today is the day I drive 65 into a tree*.
Woot!  Another Duluthian!
Just dropping in to say Hi everyone!  Have an awesome Saturday.    Bye.
oh come on!
Hate to break it to ya man, I knew I saw her somewhere else.  She even talks about being a model when she was younger in the thread. [http://www.reddit.com/r/gonewild/comments/yladd/first_time_poster_do_you_like_magic/](http://holidaygifgiver.com/media/images/gifs/450/450_original.gif)
Wow, I grew up in a house which was in the country.  I would walk to a field and just hang out all day.   Just using my imagination and being whoever I wanted out there.   Seeing this picture, completely made me smile.   I'm going through a rough time right now and you just made me feel normal.   Thank you.
My roommate has a pet ferret.  We would do "ferret bombs" where you would run up to someone lying on the couch with the ferret and stick it under their shirt or up their pant leg.  Next you would grab a squeeek toy and squeeze the shit out of it making that god awful noise.   This would drive the ferret crazy which would lead to biting and burrowing.   Man I can't wait for school start again :/
0 x 2.5 = 5?
Holy shit do I feel embarrassed for him.  Def not the right move.  We get the apology, but be a fkn man.  Just stop being an asshole and everything will go back to normal.
Bet you played for 20 seconds and said "Man this glare fkn sucks" and went back inside.
I want a furry spotted elephant!
His name is Flip.  Maybe it's a her, they never really disclose during the show.  The character was introduced in the late early/mid 2000's.  The producer of show the felt they needed a character that the more "special kids" could feel apart of the show.  This was the last ditch effort the big wigs would try to save the show.   So far, the ratings of the show have increased enough to keep it aired.  They should pull through for more seasons.  The real news is who plays the character "Flip", none other than the infamous graffiti artist, Banksy.
