TIFU by not knowing what a dodecahedron is   I play a game with my six year old where I give her a topic to research on Google and she writes a basic report or draws it, depending on the subject. We were driving somewhere yesterday and talking about shapes, the difference between a pyramid and a cone, trapezoids, rhombus, pentagons, octagons. She knows all of those, no problem. So I try to make it harder and the only thing I can think of is a dodecahedron.  "Do you know what a dodecahedron is?" I asked her.  "No. What's a dodeca... wait what did you say?" she replied. "Do-dec-a-he-dron." I repeated this a few times until she got it. "When we get home I would like you to draw it for me."   We get home, I give her my iPad, write the word down on a piece of paper for her to type into Google, and go into my office to do some work. She gets out her crayons and paper. About 10 minutes later I hear her crying. I walk into her room, there's a couple of crumpled pieces of paper on the floor and she's bawling. "IT'S THE HARDEST THING I'VE EVER DRAWN!!!!"  I thought it was a simple two-dimensional shape, like an octagon with more sides. I look on the iPad screen and see a twelve-sided, THREE DIMENSIONAL object. Aw fuck, I'm an idiot.  TL;DR: Tried to make my six year old draw a dodecahedron. Didn't know it was three dimensional. Made my kid cry and feel like a loser. Now both of us feel like losers.
It's timely because the current web trend is "thin is in." I'm doing a fair amount of that but I am careful with the contrast. A lot of websites are using 70%-ish gray thin sans fonts for body copy and I struggle to read it.
Good point.
I disagree. Scott Ritter, who was an UNSCOM weapons inspector in Iraq, was travelling throughout the country and all over the news prior to the Iraq invasion telling people that Iraq had no WMDs and no capability to make them. Congress knew (or should have known) that none of the 9/11 hijackers had any relationship to Iraq. The yellowcake story and subsequent attempts to link Iraq to 9/11 by the administration had already been discredited (look up Joseph Wilson and Valerie Plame).  If somebody voted in favor of authorizing military force against Iraq in spite of all of this, then it's clear evidence of a failure of leadership.
First, it really is a great map. Many commenters say that they wish they could do this.   No you don't.  A perfectly working human brain forgets things. This is by design. The human brain is really good at separating the wheat from the chaff, identifying and paying attention to what is important to survival and reproduction. When your brain treats every bit of information the same and remembers it all, it's a curse not a blessing.
I'm sure there are things about him that you wish were better. Maybe better abs, pecs, ass, hair, a bigger dick.  A relationship goes through these stages. At first, you are completely blind and see nothing but perfection. Then you see an imperfection, then a few more. Couples that make it through this stage find ways to accept their partner's imperfections and that is exactly what defines a successful LTR. It's not easy to do but that's also why most relationships fall apart.   I think it's healthy to get these things in the open but talk about the fact that nobody will be a perfect fit to their partner's ideal but as adults, can you find acceptance with each other's perceived shortcomings.
No, it just means American voters are dumbasses, but we already knew that.
Others have given great advice and recipes. I'll just tell you my story. The first dish I attempted for my wife as a noob cook was blackened salmon out of a recipe book given to us as a wedding present. Disastrous, as in smoke-alarms-going-off disastrous. She still loved me and appreciated it. Fortunately, I got better.

$1.4M is not really that much gold at todays prices. This guy was probably a courier for one or two high ranking government leaders and was just going to trade it for cash. Because of economic sanctions, North Korea has very little foreign cash. You need cash--like U.S. Dollars--to buy/import foreign goods. There are people who will sell you anything--Mercedes, Fendi purses (popular with the first lady), Armani suits--but they won't take the North Korean Won.  The reason why he got caught is because he didn't make any bribes or didn't bribe the right people at the airport. Arguing diplomatic immunity won't get you anywhere but if you slip enough money into your passport you could get almost anything through customs in a 3rd world country.
As somebody who has lost a mom, I have some suggestions. This would have worked well for me but I don't know your friend so keep that in mind.  I had to take care of the arrangements. That took a lot of time so I wish somebody just helped take care of little stuff. Water the plants, walk the dog, etc. Keep your eyes out for that kind of stuff and offer.  Be honest. You can't imagine how it feels if it hasn't happened to you and it's OK to just say "I can't possibly imagine what you're going through." Any sentence that starts with "I wish" isn't going to be all that helpful.  It's a sad time but it's also OK to smile, laugh and even joke--"Your mom would not approve of that shirt for her funeral." Sometimes dark humor helps crack the tension. Again, you know your friend, I don't.
Besides the storage issue which has already been covered, the other difference is that video is being processed at N frames per second whereas a camera (even a smartphone) can afford up to a couple of seconds to process and store a single image. The processing power of the security camera or the DVR affects the resolution and quality of the image.
In a case where the assailant is not known by the victim then it can lead to a match in a database. It's worthwhile in those circumstances and detectives will almost certainly order processing of the kit. But if the detective already knows who the accused is and they don't dispute that they had sex with the victim, why process the kit? The latter is the majority of rape cases.  For wrongful convictions the defendant can always ask for processing and they can also employ an independent lab to process it.
My cop bro went through it at the academy. In his video they're all laughing. You can't help it. But he said it's a good lesson, exactly for the reasons Jashinist said below. He said he never wants to go through that again.
All celestial bodies except black holes emit radiation. That radiation is comprised of many frequencies depending on the matter that it's made of and it's not hard to figure out what those frequency components are. When bodies are moving relative to each other, those frequencies get shifted slightly due to what's called the Doppler Effect (think of a train passing you and the noise it makes as it's approaching vs. traveling away). The faster they move the more the shift is. By looking at a spectral graph of a celestial body we can calculate the speed at which it's moving away or towards us from that shift.  There is no true speed, only speed in relation to a point or another celestial body (such as our Earth).
That air pressure must have a surface to push on, right? A noodle is cylindrical so there isn't any surface can accept a force which pushes the noodle inward.  Well, except for the very tip of the noodle.
But it's not limited to life threatening care. It has become the defacto doctor's office visit for everything from colds to head lice and I suspect it is the same for your county's emergency room, regardless of their official policy. These costs are a big burden for hospitals. The ACA has already resulted more people now have insurance than at any other time that the statistic has been measured. This will directly correlate to fewer emergency room visits, more preventive care doctors office visits.
Your skis respond to the input from your legs and feet. If your feet move around inside your boot, it can't properly control your skis. You'll be wasting a lot of energy trying to control skis that are wandering. On steeper runs, things happen faster and there's less room for mistakes. In bumps and crud it's absolutely critical that you can instantly adjust your skis to the varying terrain.
Yikes!
I surely hope you don't think hypothetical questions are irrelevant. Political philosophers throughout the written history of mankind have been discussing hypothetical and unreal forms of government. I'm sorry if you don't see the value in doing so.  Regardless, I was addressing "freedom therefore capitalism." My point is that you don't want the kind of pure capitalism that would appear in a completely free state. There are problems in pure capitalism that must be redressed through creating a regulated competitive market and governed by an authority to which we give power to punish. No regulatory body will be perfect because there will never be a set of regulations that are perfect. Regulations, by their nature, are restrictions of freedom which we grudgingly accept to varying degrees. They will hurt some and help others.  jefferey1313 accepts both premises--pure capitalism has problems, government regulations have problems--but could not accept the conclusion that the system isn't perfect. The only way he can do that is by believing that there is a set of perfect regulations that can be administered by a perfectly functional governing body.  TL;DR: Is capitalism problem-free? On one extreme, pure capitalism  isn't desired by most people. So we agree there are problems. Now it's just a matter of drawing the line to balance regulation and liberty.
The fact that the holocaust happened means that humans never achieved time travel.
That would be the most basic of basic backups. But it's effective.   Yes, you should be able to copy/paste to a Windows backup drive. Create a folder for your files first. Don't touch or delete any of the files  or folders that Windows has already created.
The Palestinians did not the start the 6 day war or the 1948 war. They are caught in the middle. First, the country of Israel was just *declared* by David Ben Gurion. There wasn't any treaty between any parties. Western powers in the U.N. voted to recognize it so that it would be a place for Jews to go rather than have to accept post-WWII Jewish immigrants into their own countries. Prior to Ben Gurion, in the area that is now Israel only about 15% of the population were Jews.  The 1948 war and later the 6 day war were ostensibly over Palestinian rights but truthfully were political wars. Islamic Palestinians were the vast majority of the population but they were told by the Arab armed forces to flee the area, which they did. 700,000 of them. Israel won the '48 war and took the opportunity to basically lock the gate. The refugees were not allowed back into Israel (where they and their families had lived for millenia) nor into the neighboring countries and basically were stuck in the west bank, which was taken over by Jordan. Later, after the 6 day war, Israel took hold of that territory as well.  The Palestinians have been fucked by both sides throughout the history of this conflict.
They want to get elected and they live in a right wing community.  Edit:  Sorry, that's not a helpful answer but I honestly don't know of any logical basis for their claim other than populism. The 16th amendment to the Constitution gives the federal government the ability to tax.
Yes, and thanks for a better explanation than mine.
My response assumes you're referring to the U.S. economy.  The U.S. borrows at an incredibly low interest rate, in the tenths of percent. That's because the creditworthiness of the U.S. is high. People like buying U.S. debt because it's a safe place to park their money.  The U.S. gets enormous benefit from this. Let's say you make a really cool widget out of your garage. By yourself you make one a day. A rich uncle is willing to loan you $500,000 at 0.15% interest. You can use that money to buy more equipment, hire and train workers. Now you are earning 10X or 100X what you were earning before, AND employing people. That's a multiplier effect on your GDP. You'd be stupid not to take the money.  The U.S. uses debt to build roads, networks, satellites and pays for research that benefits everyone, and a military to protect all of it. In other words, that debt helps the producers produce more in a safe and fairly well regulated market.
Dude, it sounds like she is way needy for affirmation. That's why she needs you to affirm that you still put her on a pedestal and I suspect that's also why she had the affair.   It's a double-edge sword. It may be part of why you were attracted to her to begin with (that she needs constant affection from you) but it appears that, like any drug, its effect wears off and she will go looking for more affection from other places. Until she gets some psychological help to understand why she went looking for the thrill in the first place, I'd be pretty careful.  But then, if she somehow fixes what is wrong with her, she may not be the same person you fell in love with.
A star releases its energy in all directions at once so you can see its light from any position.  Photons more or less travel straight (a photon has mass, as Einstein has taught us, so it actually bends course due to gravity as it passes by objects, but on our human scale, it goes straight). You can not see a focused beam unless your eyeball is in its path. Think of a laser pointer.
Ignore the ads. Even advertised jobs are likely to go to somebody who knows somebody. Seriously, large companies always have openings that aren't currently advertised, or they can make one for somebody who they like.  If you're terrified, tell them so. Say "I just got in town and I found your company. I really like your culture but coming in here to talk to you is something that would normally terrify me." Nothing wrong with that.  Good luck, and let me know how it goes!
You will get your wish. And you will regret it. There is no school in the SEC that is prepared for the Oregon offense. It's one thing to watch film and come up with a game plan. It's a completely different thing to be on the field.
