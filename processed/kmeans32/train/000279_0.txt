How to shoot yourself in the foot using different programming languages   Please feel free to add   Assembler:  You spend months in machine shop, hand crafting the bullet, the cartridge, and the gun.  You do your all your own casting, stamping, machining, etc.  You assemble it yourself, and you lubricate it using oils that you press from seeds in a mill that you copied from another shop where you used to work.  You set up your own chemical laboratory to make the powder and the primer.  You go so far over budget that you can only giggle about it when they ask how things are going.  Finally, you put it all together, you point the gun at your foot, you fire; and then your boss walks in and tells you to shoot the other foot too.  You calmly explain to him why you're going to have to make another gun.  Perl: it'll take a very long time to find the trigger, and once you have found it, you will notice that there are in fact an infinite number of triggers, and that you have an infinite number of toes, and you'll never be able to decide which toe you will shoot with which trigger. And without making any decision, you'll eventually end up deprived of your legs.  C: You shoot yourself in the foot.    FORTRAN: You shoot yourself in every toe, slowly, one by one,   until all toes are used up. Then you read the next foot and   repeat the process. You will continue, even though you have   used up all the ammunition, because there's no routine for   exception handling.        PL/I: You use up all the system resources including the   off-line ammunition. DP and personnel management double their size, triple their budgets, buy four new mainframes and let the  old one drop on your foot.   Pascal: The compiler won't let you shoot yourself in the foot.     Forth:  You shoot yourself through both feet with a single bullet since you are standing with one foot on top of the other.  Algol: You shoot yourself in the foot with a musket. The musket  is fascinating in aesthetic respects and the wound confuses the   young nurse in the first-aid room.        Modula-2: After discovering that you will never ever be able to   manage anything in this language you shoot yourself in the head.     Ada: If you're stupid enough to engage in this language the US   ministry of defense will kidnap you, put you in front of an   execution squad and command: Shoot at his feet!       C++: You incidentally create a dozen instances of yourself and   shoot all of them in the foot.  First aid isn't possible, as it   cannot be decided which instances are bit-accurate copies and which  only point to other ones: "Over there that's me."        Smalltalk: You are spending so much time playing with the graphics  and the windowing system, that your boss will shoot you in the foot,  take away your work station and has you coding Cobol on a   character-based terminal.        Lisp: You will shoot into the accessory, which holds the gun, that   you are using to shoot into the accessory....      Prolog: You try to shoot yourself in the foot, but the bullet,   which misses the target, ricochets into the gun which explodes in your face.      Visual Basic: You pay Microsoft an inordinate amount of money, then   they put a control right there on the button bar that shoots you in the foot.  If you don't like the implementation, fine - shoot your foot in  another language. But don't forget to buy WIN 2000 first.  Assembler You put the bullet over your foot and drive it in to the instep with a hammer.   Javascript You attach the bullet to every shoe and it fires into the foot as you tie the shoestring.  Java You attach the gun to every shoe.  When you tie the shoestring, it goes and gets a bullet and fires it into your foot.  You also can get athletes foot using Java.  BC You fire bullets into your foot of any arbitrary length and any cross section.  Best used for bullets that are several feet long.

Copper tips are plated with iron.  Once the coating is breached, the copper will start to dissolve into the solder and you will get pitting and crummy solder joints.   Instead of wet sponge use metal pot scrubber. It eliminates thermal shock that fatigues the plating.  Also when dismantling stuff do not use the tip as a crow bar.
That circuit would not work.  The page says "A simple 1kW or so resistor, 9 to 15 volts, ..."  Typo - use 1K Ohm resistor and connect it to + on the mike.  To the same point (+) connect the cap.  The other end of resistor goes to +9 to 15V.  The other end of the cap is the audio out.  - on the mike and power is your common ground.

Cops doing that; preventing a guy to make honest buck, increases crime rate in another way.  Those prevented from working will turn to crime and that is what the dark side wants.  Steady supply of criminals no matter what the "crime".  It justifies their existence.
I was looking at that too and although it looked like fire, it was most likely some kind of reflection.
