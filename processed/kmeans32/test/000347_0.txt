Good for him. And since football has a stringent drug test, especially in Europe WWE will be having a monster sized performer that should be drug free (barring any loophole stuffs)  Still remember him from the Bundesliga, and they could even make a storyline of him talking shit to the USA crowd about how Germany is no 1 in football and USA never go far in the World Cup. Instant heat

Oh god, you reminded me of an online race I had on rFactor years ago at Valencia. penalties and start accident meant I was 15s behind 3rd place, and after the last pitstop I was catching him lap by lap. I was so in the zone and like in a trance. And my roommate had to tap me on the shoulder and ruin it all :/
Rumours are he's turning heel this Sunday.  But honestly, I am so hyped about the matches that I did not even care he's included or not in the first place. He was not in the Raw after Payback (with Randy) and was blended into the background as Ambrose and Rollins take the spotlight for the last two weeks, and it kinda worked.
Actually NXT is the sum of a lof of contributers. Never pin down NXT's success or growth to one man, because it's not. And I don't think anyone down in NXT would want to either  HHH, Regal, Dusty, Terry Taylor, Norman Smiley, Steve Keirn, Gerald Brisco, Del ray, and a lot more contributed to the growth and the high quality product that we are seeing today.
Yes.
Started following F1 when it was held in Malaysia in 99. While technically the internet exist, it's still in it's infancy and you have to go to a cybercafe to use it, which is costly to me.   Thankfully every Sunday there is a cars special slip out section in our newspapers, and Mobil One sponsors a 10 page F1 spreadout in  it. So I collected that. And since Mobil One sponsors McLaren, it also has special features on Mika and DC  I remember watching races delayed, and I would turn off all radio and TV news before watching them.

It's because they used her for the whole taping session, which is why she seems to be on every episode.   And you she needs the exposure. You don't become good from just hiding behind the scene. She might not be good now. but in time with enough experience she would
Currently I am taking "TNA is dead" with a grain of salt. It's like a new meme of wrestling.   With the report that they are talking to Young Bucks, I don't think their position is that bad. Not making as much as they would like, yes, but not as bad as people are making them to be.

It's a Malaysian plane bound to Malaysia with a whole lot of Malaysian families. It was like when JBL did the Nazi salute in Germany.   Yes, we know you are a heel, but there are something you can't do.
I don't agree to an extent. What's the best flowing track on the calendar? Hungaroring. The drivers love it because once you're in the groove, it's like riding a roller coaster driving there. But we all know how hard it is to overtake there.   While a circuit should be blamed, some of the problem also lies with the cars themselves. The dirty air syndrome was always something the FIA had tried to get rid of, every time they introduce a new rule. But every time they do, engineers find a way to gain more downforce in areas they could, which in turn, introduce back this problem. The rulings for 2009 for example was introduced due to this as well as various ruling there after, but almost always, the teams manage to churn out a car that still has this problem.  Combined that with Pirelli tyres that does not last that much (because oh, people want to see tyres that does not last) you have team that err on the side of caution and instruct the drivers to drive within a certain constraint.

Reigns vs Big Show  Triple Threat feat. Reigns and Ryback  Nope, I just went to sleep rather than waste any energy
Cole added it a bit later  "Remember folks, this is a no disqualification match".   Either I did not hear it the first time, or the dub it in the Network replay of WM
Efficiency. It's not just purely down to the lower revs. A Le Mans engineer once said that any noise is just wasted energy. And with the 100kg fuel limit, engine manufacturers had to make engine as efficient as they can.
It was to plug in Ahnold's movie. And it's best for Trips to be the sacrificial goat for it rather than anybody else
I just realised that after you mentioned it and went back to see my pics  http://i.imgur.com/sDmRs57.jpg  You're right, can't seem to see it here
Also as long as they (Mercs) are winning or near the top, other teams would want their engines, which in turn would be profitable in the long run as well.
As much as I also wants to see this, it won't happen. The Takeover special is always done at Full-Sail for the students there to learn how WWE makes a live show/PPV.
Watching it in a cinema is awesome, especially with the 7.1 audio.   - animation is as good as it can be, but the CGI sometime looks overdone. I love how the crowd was animated/CGI'ed. They do not look copy pasted, but looks like a crowd of individuals  - I know the manga was kind of funny. But I never expected they would keep it in the movie. Lucifer/Ral adventure was kinda weird to watch, but man it was funny  - After watching this, now I realised why Char/Casval hated Amuro. He was the original angsty, emo kid in a death machine and Amuro stole that gimmick
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Link_Interface  I based my explanation on this + forums and google. Usually when a new driver is announced by AMD/Nvidia, you can read in the update notes things like   Optimised (game name here) for SLi/Crossfire  So that's how we can guess the drivers is the one handling the workload.
the first result for googling kl is?
Give him any kind of car, and he will drive it. While Alonso can be said to have a similar ability, Hamilton seems to just be able to get in the car, and just drive it, while Alonso might need more time to learn the car.   I was impressed with Hamilton in 2009. He managed to wring that POS McLaren to places and wins that it was not supposed to have. It might be that during that time he used the car to learn how to drive on the edge, but yet save fuel and save his tyres, two thing that he was really bad at in 2008 and 2007  I still rate Alonso higher as he is the most complete package on the grid today, but I really love Hamilton as the pure racing driver

Let's give some appreciation to the F1 engineers   I mean honestly, year after year they would always amaze me. No matter what kind of rules that are thrown at them, there will be always someone, somewhere that can find a solution to the problem, and will be then copied down the grid.   After 5 races, I can see the car can potentially be as fast as last year, and considering how much the FIA are restricting the downforce and aero, this is no mean feat.

[PSA]Wanting cheap F1 merchandise, visit their sales section   Usually teams would do sales to get rid of their old stocks.  McLaren has the best value for monies currently due to lowest needed for free worldwide shipping  http://www.mclarenstore.com/en/restofworld/sale/icat/sale  http://shop.mercedes-amg-f1.com/c/6/sale  http://www.williamsf1.com/Team/Shop/  http://www.redbullshop.com/redbull/en/rb-racing/exclusive-shop-offers/c/rbr-sale  http://www.redbullshop.com/redbull/en/scuderia-toro-rosso/exclusive-shop-offers/c/str-sale  http://www.forceindiaf1.com/shop  http://shop.caterhamf1.com/  http://store.sauberf1team.com/en/  http://store.ferrari.com  http://www.lotusf1team.com/lotus-shop/  Notes:    Williams online shop are still closed   Marussia don't seem to have one   Lotus don't seem to care that 2013 was last year   Red Bull/Toro Rosso's "sale" is not really cheap, especially if you want the free shipping   No sales for Force India nor Ferrari   Merc price is quite good, but no free shipping   It's cheap to use RM to buy in the Caterham shop, but sadly their paypal account won't accept RM for some reason. I had to contact their sales to get my payment through
[Meta] For photographers, look back at your first cosplay pic you took, and compare it with your current ones   Have you ever went back to look at the old pictures that you took, and thought to yourself, "Man, I was crap back then".   For example some of my earliest ones:   http://i.imgur.com/ua5k3hA.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/vHae0XP.jpg  I actually cringed and wondered how on earth I thought it was good back then
How long til we see people doing a sniper/spotter teamwork?   Since the Recon class in BF4 has the PLD, as well as the ability to "zero" the optics, I wonder how long does it take til two recons work in tandem, with one using the PLD to gauge how far the target is, and the second one will snipe accordingly.   This combo in theory would be faster (since only one recon is scouting, so there is not time wasted between switching from the PLD to the rifle and then adjusting the scope) and much more safer (spotter can also watch out for other threats incoming)
