Anyone know a video/highlight reel that shows Eli walking through the tunnel?   Specifically one that's professional, so not someone filming on their phone. I know they usually show this of players at the beginning of game recaps, specifically on opening day or if they had a particularly good/bad day. And I'm sure there's clips of it in some of the recent America's Games.   That being said, was hoping someone might know of the top of their head before I spend time digging through the possibilities.  Go Giants.
Gonna have some tough love here. It sounds like you're in difficult situation, but it also sounds like you've been making excuses for yourself for quite some time.   No matter how bad the job might be, working regularly is a great source of pride and independence. You'll find just doing this for a small period of time will make your realize how capable you are and open up other avenues to you. Having an ambition to be a comic book writer/artist is awesome, and its something that can be pursued and developed in your free time. There's a lot of good resources out there on where to begin with something like that.  I'd suggest going on Craigslist and seeing what's available, start narrowing it down from there.
During the day, and all I need is power/wifi. I was specifically referring to places within New York City, so while the poolside resort sounds appealing I don't think its a realistic option.
Purchase it, borrow it from someone you know, or just post up in a book store all day and read it. I'm not even going on some self-righteous don't torrent rant. Watchmen is an artistic masterpiece and to look at it on your computer/ipad screen is going to utterly dilute your experience.  You should be able to find it used pretty reasonably priced on Amazon or Ebay.
Nice!
Appreciate such a comprehensive response!  You are correct in identifying them as Stafford loans(4/6 of them are anyway).  To your questions:  1) I do not have an emergency savings. I just started building it up a couple weeks ago, opened a savings account and designated auto-deposits.   2) About 5% of my monthly income.  3) Stable as it can get. Catastrophe a la financial crisis is really the only scenario I see losing it, but let's be honest that could happen at any moment these days.  Sounds like the best strategy is to allocate all of my extra $ (my  goal is for 50% of monthly income) towards emergency fund and loan payoff. Having the mindset of paying off the loans being the equivalent of a 6.8% ROI is the best way for me to rationalize it.  Thanks!
Why are Frank Miller's "Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again" and "All Star Batman   Robin, the Boy Wonder" held in such low regards?   I'm new to comics and recently finished TDKR series and Year One. I loved both, blown away by them. Both of the series I mentioned in my title apparently received quite negative reviews. I plan on reading them, but am curious how this community feels as to why there was such low reception. Some of what I have read is that Batman is depicted as being too dark/gritty, bordering on a psychopath, but to be honest that makes these appeal to me even more.
Oh dear

It's a fair trade, and you clearly don't need Grilli. That being said in a 10 man you could probably do better than peralta at SS. Who's available on waivers?
Billy butler
Awesome! Thank you for this.
Fuck yeah
Buy buy buy
Then we're like-minded individuals. The name still carries cache though and there's plenty of ignorant owners that would deal for him thinking he's a good buy-low.
See my above response to the exact same question you asked. I came to my conclusion using projections, I'm not claiming to be a fortune teller, just offering my opinions. If you "don't see valid reasoning", than by all means pick him up.
http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/trying-to-solve-the-alex-guerrero-problem/  This gives a pretty comprehensive explanation of the situation. It's unfortunate because if he was on any other team he'd be playing every day, the dodgers simply have too many talented players.   The reason to be optimistic is that these guys are going to get injured as the season goes on, and there will be more opportunities for mattingly to squeeze him into the lineup.
1) stop panicking he's had two starts.  2) drop him? Are you kidding me? Trade the guy if you don't want him. If you drop him you will be deservingly the laughingstock of your league.  3) pick up Archie Bradley just drop someone else
He got very lucky last year. Look him up on fangraphs there's a good amount of material on how his peripherals screamed regression for this year. Still a good player, just probably won't repeat last years effectiveness. I'd try to deal him to someone looking to buy low.  EDIT: I still think he's better than the waiver wire fellas you mentioned
Suggestions for a backpack I can wear while jogging that will safely hold my DSLR?
Awesome, really impressed with how well put together this is. Already feel immersed after reading, artwork also very cool. Never stop creating.
This was fundamentally a completely different offense than what had been in place for the better part of a decade. Very difficult to learn and succeed during the season, naturally going to have a lot of growing pains. If you watch the team's performance throughout the year there is a lot of evident progress, I'm excited to see what it can do next year with an improved line.  Take veteran quarterbacks in the league who are considered top of their class: Brady, Rodgers, Peyton, Brees- out of these, these players have been in the same system their entire careers (I know Peyton changed teams, but he's on another level and runs his own operation- this scheme stayed the same). If you take any of these guys and stick them in an entirely different offense schematically, there's going to be significant growing pains. And while there was a good amount of miscommunication early on in the year, Eli still put up very good numbers overall, which is reason to have higher expectations heading into next season.  Other commentators have mentioned we were beleaguered with injuries- this is true, but honestly I don't like using it as an excuse because I feel good teams can overcome that.  Giants had a lot of games this year they were competitive in until the 4th quarter when they fell apart.  Defense was completely unreliable, truly atrocious at times. Perry Fewell would have been fired in 2011 if it hadn't been for Eli bailing out the defense each week and eventually winning a Super Bowl.  Special Teams is another black eye for the Giants and has been for quite some time. Our coach, Tom Quinn, I'm convinced is someone in ownership's brother-in-law, boggles my mind the man has a job in this league.  Giants fans have a lot to be excited about going into next year. The division has some powerful teams, but it's certainly within their grasp.
Vonnegut.
I'd do it
Hard to make a decision surrounding someone as risky as Abreu. Let's say he lives up to part of the hype and puts together a good first half- then yes the trade is worth it. Your rotation is strong enough to lose Cobb, however I'd wait and see what Abreu is first.
I just finished "Stranger in a Strange Land". A popular science fiction novel from the sixties, this delves into a deep examination of what we value in a western culture, particularly in regards to religion and sexuality.  More importantly, this book is funny. There's humor enriched in all the pages, and makes reading it a genuinely enjoyable experience.   After reading intense and complicated sci-fi, I chose this as a light option. I ended doing a serious examination about what my values are how people view things in western (especially American) society.  I'd suggest looking up some of the tremendous quotes from this book on a site like Goodreads, see if you find any intriguing, you may want to pick it up.
Help on name of a song featured in an episode?   The scene I'm referring to is where Mcnulty is sitting in his car drunk. He's on top of a hill, some kind of commotion happens at the bottom of it and causes a car alarm to go off. He gets out, shows his badge, and slips and slides down the hill because he's so hammered. Then proceeds to start laughing when he sees mud on his badge and the obvious metaphor.  Anyway, there's a oldie playing in his car, sung by a woman- can't for the life of me think of the song. Can't remember the episode or season or I'd try to find it myself. Hope I gave a decent description and one of you can help me out. Thanks all.
Cocaine's a helluva drug.
Rainey without question.
Sales!  Just kidding. Something you could do part time is customer support. Now I know this goes against what you just said- you'd be interacting with strangers. But I think this would be a more comfortable environment for you, and more importantly would help you overcome your fear of interacting with people.   EDIT: Spelling/Grammar
Might want to cut down on those yolks for starters, that's what going to mainly affect your cholesterol and egg whites will give you plenty of protein.  Beans, lentils, tuna fish, peanut butter, and nuts- all great sources. If you can find some organic low sodium canned beans, they are an excellent healthy and inexpensive option- and pack a great deal of protein.
American Psycho. A tremendous satire on the Wall Street/Yuppie culture that permeated the elite class of new york city in the 1980s....and some of the most disturbing passages you will ever read. If you've got a weak stomache, the last 1/3 of this book should be avoided.
