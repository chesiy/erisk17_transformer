I just finished Red Rising.   Holy crap was it good! I finished it almost a day and my mind is a million miles away right now.  My question to ya'll is: what book sucked you in the most?
Fuck man I can't handle that right now.  It's just too much.
I was just about to ask if this show got any better.  I have my answer.
This is my second bike and I'm in love with it as well.  Well good luck to ya man, sending some good vibes your way.  Have fun out there!

To be honest I didn't think people hated her.  Maybe mock/parody her image but it's all in good spirit.
I just got one of those acouple weeks ago.  I'm in love.
Ha sorry guys I didn't think anyone would ask.  From the top down: boker kwaiken, leatherman crater, buck nobleman, spyderco tenacious, Mtech stiletto and i don't know what the last one is.
I think he used that knife because of how simplistic the handle was. There isn't a lot of nooks and crannies for blood to sit and dry and it looks really easy to clean.  Perfect for a serial killer with morals.
Thanks! Will do.

I have a question.   I read all of the light novel translations that can be found in the sidebar.  My question is; is there a difference between those translations and the official ones? And how is that different from the progressive?
How big is that blade? I love the knife but seems a little to big for every day carry.
Gratuitous.
