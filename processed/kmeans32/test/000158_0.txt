So I have this hair particle system on a plane, as I'm trying to do a grass scene. Only thing is, when the grass particle "spawns", it is inside the plane. Is there anyway I can move just the hair particle system upwards?
Since this is r/ Pixar, I assume someone knows how to create an AllPurposeMaterial in Renderman. Can you any Renderman fans point me in the right direction? The Pixar documentation doesn't give clear instructions.
Reddit, I don't think I can go on for much longer. It's so hard. I'm running track, but I lose a lot. 4th place in hurdles. You'd think that's good, but no I get compared to my cousins...     I've had enough. This has gone on forever. I will never be good enough. Plus my dad called me a dick and always yells. I find refuge in creating levels and unity 5. I bake textures in Blender cycles and then send it to unity so the graphics look like fucking Gravity. It's amazing. I thought my family would be proud. But no. My family said I spent too much time online, which I felt was a fucking erroneous assumption, since I only worked on the project for 30 minutes each day before going outside and trying to please everyone in track.     It's killing me. I can't go on much longer.
My border collie "laughs" when I rub my penis on her face? Does anyone know why this happens?
Ahh ok
I'm exporting animation to cryengine. Can I bake armature keyframe poses into regular LocRotScale/shape keys so blender thinks it's hardbody animation?     Seriously. Cryengine can't read cryblends cfg or armature files. So don't try. Please, I just want to know how to bake armature poses into hardbody poses.
Basically, I want to do a scene where my dog is holding a gun. She's a border collie, so she's pretty smart, but not smart enough to handle a gun prop whilst standing on her hind legs. Any ideas?   I was thinking of me in one of those green morph suits and holding her paws with the gun and then painting me out later in AE.
I've box mapped my character in blender because the blender uv editing system sucks. Will unreal engine read this as uvs and map my materials onto the model just like blender?
I'm animating cgi for a film and discovered ptex, but when I try to export the textures on my model, I get an invalid argument error? I know this isn't r/ vfx, but I'm on a time stress, I need answers!   I'm trying to get my ptex from mudbox to maya, but the textures won't extract. http://imgur.com/tHLAMLI
Element 3d v2 compatible with after effects cs5?   Yes or no?
Alright, I wanna make $500. I'm going to use mturk, post loop, click worker, and swagbucks. How much should I work and how long will it take to get this amount?    Also, what other sites could I use?
How do you make a film plot interesting? In other words, what are some tips for keeping your audience on the edge of their seats?       I've worked on a few vidya games which was pretty cool, but I was completely sapped of creativity. We used CryEngine, and I realized how similar it looked to CGI movie effects. I started comparing films to video games.    I asked myself, "How can a film be more interesting than a video game if a video game is so interactive and keeps the player on the edge of their seat?"      Anyway, long story short, what are some nifty writing and editing tricks to keep the film vibrant, exciting, and interesting?
Alright, how does an indie dev get his hands on a Wii U devkit?      I think R/ Nintendo would know better than anyone else.  I know you need to have an agreement with Nintendo, so where do I start?  How do I acquire a devkit? How do I publish my game for the Wii U?
Let's rethink the derez effect?     I have seen Tron and Tron: Legacy. I always loved the derez effect. Whether it was evaporation or programs shattering into thousands of cubical vowels.    I have also seen a few episodes of VGHS, and the derez effect is also pretty cool.    If you were creating a movie which has a plot centered around a vidya gam or a computer, how would you recreate this effect?
Alright, what about this. http://nibbler.silktide.com/en/reports/mvutbrviwojhuvqp.softstorepremium.com  I really want this site to be legit. I am looking for cheap prices to buy After Effects, 3ds Max, and Autodesk Maya. That is my dilemma. I want to buy these usually expensive softwares for $150-$400.
It is certified by McAfee though.
What might you mean, good sir?
EA
What is a reseller? I really want to buy Maya, and a reseller seems the way to go. Can I negotiate prices with a reseller or what?

Hello. I use softwares such as nuke, modo, renderman, after effects, and I'm looking into Maya. So I want to know, can any of these softwares do realistic muscle, liquid, and/or debris simulations?   I asked r/ vfx, but I want an answer from a larger community.
I'm tired of it... It's always about my family, never about me...     Greetings Reddit, I think I'm done.  I can't take it anymore! I have no one to talk to!   I'm such a loser, one of my teachers has a strong disliking towards me, I live in my cousin's shadow, and my dad was never there for me...   One day at school, I had had it. I was gonna do it. I tried to tell myself that I was being irrational.    I went to the counselor. They called my mom. Rather than being supportive or consoling, she got onto me for telling the school, saying that they're going to label me.   I wanted to talk to my dad, but he is overseas. He doesn't give enough of a care.   I have no one to talk to. I'm a popular guy, and have many friends, too many to count, but yet, I have no one to talk to!    My parents and my friends are only concerned for themselves. It's always them, not me...   I can't tell you how many times I've been cheated out of birthday celebrations, or have never been called by my dad.    I can't do it Reddit!
I'm scared that Minecraft is dieing...     I feel like the community is dieing. I don't want Minecraft to end. Minecraft is a beacon of hope in the hell that is the gaming world, it is a fresh page that stands out against the all the "GUNZ BLAZIN COD FPS".    Minecraft doesn't feel fun anymore. It feels like it's dragging with all the recent updates. What do we do? I don't want minecraft to die!
(US) How legit are those paid survey websites?
What is the source of this?
Good places to find The Foundry's Nuke for a cheaper price?   I see places where you can find after effects, MODO, Cinema 4d and all those goodies for sometimes half-price, but are there any good places where you can find a copy of The Foundry's Nuke for $2500-1000 at least?
Which version of cinema 4d should I buy?   What is the most powerful at compositing yet is pretty cheap?
Code injector for ios?     A good code injector is needed.  It doesn't have to be, but specifically one where code modifications can be made directly from the jailbroken phone.
Thank you, my good sir!
A few rules.     1. Play nice. Try not to flame. Let admins defuse the situation.   2. Don't post things that are retarded and unrelated.   3. Post prehistoric content other than dinosaurs from time to time.   4. No religious references. I have nothing against religion. I am quite fascinated by it. But "God/Allah did it 6000 years ago" doesn't satisfy our thirst for prehistoric knowledge.
We've heard this story a hundred times. "Scientists discover new alien planet capable of supporting life!" People get hyped. No further research goes into the planet. The hype dies.      Anyone else remember Glise 581 from 2007?
Because, if you watched the videos I put links to, you'll see their massive numbers. Plus, that was only a small fraction of 4chan. Us Redditors have been a thorn in 4chans side, so some think they plan to launch a campaign. Plus they wouldn't stop at griefing, it would be followed by the hacking of admin accounts and Ddos attacks.
