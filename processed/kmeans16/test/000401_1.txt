Agreed!
Pitch Perfect
American Hustle an overhyped film that did not reach the expectations from all the buzz it was getting.
Thank you, I needed this. I'm planning to tell my parents soon. Cross my fingers and hope it goes well.
Of course, we all knew what was going to happen. But the movie could of been done better. It was so obvious what was going to happen in Titanic, but the movie was 100% times better than Pompeii.
50/50
Dont give up, lol i hope
Make sure that she did not sleep with anyone else because there is a slim chance it could not be your baby. You should be supportive and ask what she wants. I think abortion would be the best route to go because its unplanned, you guys are both young, it was a one night stand but its all up to you two.
I think it's great that you were able to find an outlet, maybe explain to your parents in a way where she has to listen and say that you need this to help you. Do you like movies, TV shows, writting poems etc? Maybe there is another outlet you can use? My life is pretty hetic so I watch Movies, TV shows as an outlet to distract myself from the real world
I know how you feel, but the only thing changed about your dad is that he has cancer. I know it's hard and trust me I'm 20 years old and my dad has been having it for the past 3 years trying to find a cure. Last month, we found out that it spread. The only thing you can do is remain strong, find people that you can talk to, I go speak to a lady because at 20 years old my friends some of them don't know how to respond to the shit im going through. Find an outlet to distract you, such as movies, writing etc. It's going to be hard, but it will make you stronger and you're family as well!
12 Years A Slave- very powerful performance from Chiwetel Ejofor  Wolf of Wall Street- Leonardo DiCaprio (poor guy, gets beaten each time nominated for an Oscar and never wins- hope this is the time)  American Hustle- Christian Bale
Walk To Remember
Way Way Back, 50/50, Sliver Linings Playbook, State of Play, Taken
I think for it to be nominated at the Golden Globes, American Hustle would have to be in the comedy category. There were a few minor scenes such as the ice fishing moments that were funny, but the majority of the movie was a drama. I feel like this movie will get lots of nominations, but has a possibility of not winning any awards because it was slightly overrated and personally I thought Sliver Linings Playbook was WAY better than American Hustle (im slightly biased)
I saw the movie today with my family including my parents. And maybe this was not the right movie choice to go see it with because there wasn't just one or two there was like 60% sex/naked woman which made it a little awkward plus I was beside my dad watching it which didn't make it any better. It was 3 hours long which was a little too long to sit in a movie theatre for, but Leonardo DiCaprio did a great performance as Jordan Belfort who gets a little too caught up with himself when he becomes richie rich. Jonah Hill was in it, he was alright but I think Leonardo stole the show.
