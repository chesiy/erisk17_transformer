As dank as this post was, it belongs to the interwebz now. Be a gentlesir and let le may-may go.
kindest thing i have ever heard      Have you spent your entire life having insults shouted at you by the ghost of Hitler? It certainly was kind, but the kind*est* thing you have ever heard? C'mon.

Check out his wikipedia article and see if you can find the latest edit. [Here's a screen cap](http://i.imgur.com/3ZkcK9M.png), because I'm sure it won't last long.
Who are you to judge a dog as unhealthy or "poor taste" just because it has a slight defect? What are you, a vet? Perhaps you're some fancy pants dog judger? You know, some dogs are just ugly, even without "defects." And what about all the pictures of dogs with underbites that have been posted? Isn't that a birth defect?    **Your sub is bad and you should feel bad.**
Two words, bitch: Glass ceiling. BAM!      Disclaimer: This is a joke. In no way does the poster of this comment believe that people should be barred from advancement in their profession due race, ethnicity, gender, or disability. Please don't ban me.      Edit: Missing comma.      Thank you for pointing out my typo. I'm glad you all had fun deriding my peasant syntax while having a stereotypical reddit circlejerk about punctuation.
I'm on the east coast (contrary to what you seem to believe, Canada doesn't end at the Ontario-Quebec border). They sell these every spring/summer here.
Came to this sub by accident because I hit the "random" button, saw this post, and was really saddened by your situation. I don't usually give advice, but here goes.    Be yourself, OP. Don't try to be someone else by mimicking what you think is "normal" behaviour. Do your best to fit in if that's what you feel will make you happy, but don't feel like you have to put on an act for others for them to like you; you'll never be happy as long as you're acting your way through life. I don't have Asperger's Syndrome, but I know others that do have it, and I never once expected them to "act normal." It's a disability that people should understand and respect. Your family should be giving you the support you need, not acting like there's something wrong with you.      Have you met with a counsellor? If your family have been as unsupportive as your post suggests, perhaps you should find one have have your immediate family members meet with them too.
Here, have an upgoat.
I was very much expecting that. You could see the pike stalking the ducklings from the very beginning of the gif.

Hey, everyone, look! It's the [guy from the Internet!](http://dilbert.com/strip/2015-06-07)
No. No, it does not. I'm not sure what made me come up with that.
I put my penis in your girlfriend all the time, but she doesn't seem to mind when I do it.
The sign was originally "girl under a desk." It was photoshopped to say "Anne Frank." Does that make you happy?    Look, dude, all I did was make an inane comment on a silly post on reddit. It's what I do on this site. I don't take it seriously like you do. Judging from your commenting history, you're nothing but a loser neckbeard who sits around on his computer all day. If you want to feel smart, get out of your house and make something of your life instead of trying to pick fights on the internet.
*cringes violently*
Thank you for answering a lot of questions I could never find straight answers for. I'll be checking out your blog from now on.
I've made it pretty far by some standards, but I wouldn't say I'm "stellar." Thank you for the compliment, though! :)
It's rare to see one of these that's actually funny. Dank indeed, sir.
I saw this in liquor stores in the 1980s. The chilling machines at my neighbourhood liquor store were tinted blue on the inside, so it looked like you were putting beer in blue water. I thought that was a nice touch. I haven't seen them since. Thanks for taking me down Memory Lane, OP.

Oh, okay.
Fucking idiot.
Thanks, bro. It's helpful people like you who make reddit a place worth coming to.
^ L(e)iterally this, amirite?       ^  ^  Upboats to the left!
A bloody anything for that matter.
That was me, not Vegeta. And "that thing" was your mom. Have some respect for the woman who brought you into this world.
There is NOTHING shitty about peanut butter. EVER. You hear me? You could spread PB on a turd and I would happily eat it.
Are you sure this isn't just [a scene from Ghost Rider?](http://i.imgur.com/QmD9jIU.jpg)

Hi Reddit, this is Reddit. I'll be answering Reddit's questions for the next few hours, so ask me anything!   EDIT: This is my first time getting gold, and I'd like to thank whoever it was that gifted it. I tried finding out who it was, but I'm not very computer savvy. I ended up accidentally downloading a terabyte of child porn and now I'm under arrest.  EDIT 2: Keep the questions coming, Reddit!
