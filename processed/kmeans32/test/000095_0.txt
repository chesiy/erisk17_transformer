2 year RCT of Human caloric restriction: Improvements found in insulin sensitivity, sustained weight loss and decreases in cardiac risk factors
Using genetic editing to create low fat bacon - potential agricultural use of recent improved gene editing techniques but is it ethical?
Good point, human cardiac progenitor cells (from human ES/IPSC lines) have been shown to be functional within 2 weeks in 3D culture (in fibrin or collagen gels) so their protocol to get cardiac progenitors might not be optimized to generate functional tissue. They just said that the cardiac progenitors were a gift from a company in the paper so it's hard to know how good/differentiated the cells were when seeded.   Thanks for the reply!
The decellularization process, when done correctly/adequately, should eliminate virtually all DNA and immune antigens from the tissue. This means that there shouldn't be an immune response and no anti-rejection/immunosuppresive drugs are needed like a normal transplant.   Organs decellularized from pigs have been used in humans without the need for immunosupressants so that shouldn't be an issue with this technique if it gets that far.
This study was done on normal people (20yr old, recreationally active men with no "disease") and they did find an effect.  By oxygen uptake kinetics they referring more to uptake of oxygen by muscle and not blood oxygenation as you're referring to. Oxygen uptake can be increased by improving oxygen availability to muscle (e.g. improved blood flow to muscle) and shifting from anaerobic to oxidative metabolism and/or increasing  the rate of oxidative metabolism. In short, citrulline seems to be capable of doing both hence the improved oxygen uptake and exercise performance but more research is needed to figure out the mechanisms and relative contribution of each process.
Yep what you're doing seems fine so keep it up!  Personally, I need at least 2 days rest a week or I get injured (my family seem to have bad tendons and slow regeneration/recovery - not saying that you will!). I'd recommend having one rest day a week just to make sure you don't overdo it.
Definitely, I didn't mean don't do strength training just that from a mortality point increased cardiovascular fitness seems to have a bigger effect. CV and strength training have overlapping and distinct benefits. From a quality of life point of view, increased strength and resistance programs in elderly patients improve quality of life and help maintain independence.
For the study I was involved in it was 12 - all the patients were diabetic, all were over 50 and the majority not exercised for a long amount of time. There are obviously concerns with those patients so the lower end of moderate activity was targeted. A previous small trial at the institute had found that for those patients longer adherence to the exercise program was achieved at that scale compared to higher RPEs.  I should have put the range which is 12-14 for moderate exercise so thanks for the input!
Something I put on another post about this:  The term muscle in these studies is a little misleading and a bit confusing. The "muscles" they make are not meant to be used in people but in machines as actuators.  They took the outer layer of an onion (the epidermis) as at the microscopic level it mimicked a very basic muscle structure (aligned, densely packed rectangles in the onion vs aligned, densely packed cylinders in native muscle).   They then freeze-dried it to get rid of water and to make it structurally stable. This meant that they had a sheet that kind of looked like a muscle but obviously without any contractile proteins to make the structure contract.  To get the muscle to contract the added/plated a very thin layer of gold to both sides of their onion layer. Gold is electrostatic, so when the applied a voltage they could get their onion layer to move due to electrostatic forces. Essentially the same basic science as when you rub a balloon against a surface (the voltage in this study) and it makes your hair (in this case the artificial "muscle") stick up.  I don't know enough about these artificial "muscles" to know the significance of the work but it's a pretty cool proof of concept. If this will translate to something you can buy or will wind up in electronics I'd assume not as down the line somebody will engineer a polymer or plastic that does this.
The .gov really has no influence on the paper, the website is a database where peer-reviewed journals upload abstracts and links to accepted papers. Journals from all over the world (i.e. with no government affiliations) use the database as it enables researchers to easily find new or old papers.  The paper is a review paper, summarizing the findings in the field so no new findings or physical study was performed. The paper is also peer-reviewed by experts in the field who would/should ensure that a fair reflection of the literature was provided and discussed.
Scientists engineer the most complete in vitro slow muscle to date by using only electrical stimulation
A couple of points about the study:  "Based on previous findings, the researchers had predicted that whey protein would be better at facilitating an increase in muscle mass and a decrease in fat, but this wasn't the case"  1. This is an acute study looking at one time point - 3hrs post-ingestion. No change in muscle or fat mass would be able to be measured, so they're looking at markers which might extrapolate to changes in muscle or fat mass. The long-term studies in humans that are cited in the paper show that over prolonged periods (8-12wks) whey induces increases in muscle mass but egg protein does not when combined with resistance exercise. Whey protein given to elderly or ill patients (e.g. cancer, ALS) seem to benefit from whey alone without resistance exercise. If whey alone (i.e. no resistance exercise) in a typically "healthy" person has positive effects on muscle:fat mass I'm not sure.  2. The key here is the 3hr time point, in the rat model they use it's been shown that leucine (thought to be the key amino acid in the beneficial effects of whey protein) increase maximal levels of protein synthesis but not the duration following feeding. The max occurs at ~90mins but is back to basal at 180mins (norton et al. 2009) and is seen in humans too (Tang et al. 2009). It's interesting that they still see an increase in anabolic markers at 180mins, perhaps due to the longer fast (18hrs vs 12hrs) in this study. Anyway, my point is that changes in protein synthesis may only be detectable/significant before 180mins.  3. Figure 1E - the pure whey and 70whey/30egg are significantly higher than control but the 50:50 and 30:70 groups are not. Also, all the protein fed groups are not statistically different from each other. However, you're interested in maximizing protein synthesis to control which from the data shows that the high whey content would be a better choice.  Also going off the puro blot, the pure whey seems to be a lot higher than the other groups - indicating higher protein synthesis (obviously it's a presentation blot and might not be the most representative sample). All the blots aren't from the same gel and the loading controls vary a lot which brings up an important point with the phospho data.  4. It seems that all phosphorylation data is not presented relative to the total levels of the protein which is how it should be done, as it is the ratio of phospho to total that you're interested in. No loading controls are presented and given the puromycin blot in figure 1g it's hard to imagine they have consistent loading in any of their gels. Presenting the data as phospho-to-total helps overcome that limit and normalizes the data more consistently between samples.  5. I don't know much about satiety so I can't say much about it. The only point I'd make is that they looked at mRNA only and not blood levels of leptin, ghrelin etc. Many mRNAs are also regulated post-transcriptionally - that means that though mRNA may increase it doesn't mean you get an increase in the protein. I don't know if leptin mRNA correlates well to changes in leptin levels.  Overall, I wouldn't say it's a good paper due to the one time point, poor presentation of the blots, the fact the phospho-blots aren't normalized to the respective total (HSL is normalized to GAPDH which is a loading control, which though not ideal is better than not normalizing it) and not measuring circulating levels of satiety hormones.
OK, a lot of people didn't like me saying exercise and eat as well as you can. The exercise and eat well was a general piece of advice not just about recovery for the general public.   Looking at recovery for a one-off diet doesn't mean that it will translate to a long-term benefit.   In this study a high fat diet led to a reduce improvement in exercise following an 8 wk training program compared to a high carb diet. Both improved performance but the carb diet was better than a high fat diet: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1158881/  Does that mean a high-fat diet is always bad? Perhaps not if you're an elite athlete, here endurance trained athletes did not have the same negative effects on energy efficiency as sedentary people in response to a high-fat diet. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21632846 and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21106937  Does that mean fat is bad and shouldn't be used, again no. In this study low fat decreases performance http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10682876  In terms of the protein the source of protein is important to maximize protein synthesis, with whey protein being the best due to its high branched chain amino acid (particularly leucine) content and how rapidly it can be digested and taken up into the bloodstream:  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19589961  Does that mean that whey protein work well with the whole population? No, elderly people have lower response to it but including vitamin D3 and additional lecuine can help maintain muscle mass in elderly obese patients on a weight loss program. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25646324  Exercise acts as a potent inducer of protein synthesis when eating a meal (i.e. eating will increase protein synthesis, exercise and get a bigger increase which can lead to increases in muscle mass): http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23438221  That's a few links there. Are there some contradictory papers, yes there will be and there will be other supporting the claims. The papers I've picked are ones where they have been performed well and are not acute but occur over a period of time. A lot of papers citing high fat diet benefits are from rats (different metabolism, more distinct fiber-types and they are allowed to give more extreme diets) which may not translate to humans.  People like a yes or no, good or bad answer for everything. People respond differently due to genetics, age, disease etc. This means that different diets can have vastly different effects on people. Taking into account the general population eating a balanced diet and exercise will help keep you healthier was the point that I was making. In my opinion people get too caught up in "Oh you need this extreme diet or pill to see a benefit of exercise". Can they help, in some cases but not all. If it works for you great but people thinking they need some diet can put them off exercise when it shouldn't really. If you want to eat fast food go ahead and if you exercise it's better for you. If you want to take anything from this then just exercise!  EDIT: made a mistake in the penultimate sentence and gave a clearer message
This is a response to both your comments and a general overview of the paper for everyone, the points I make are generalized but to help understand what might be going on:  The paper (see here, open access: http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/wp-content/uploads/advpub/2015/1/ehp.1408698.acco.pdf) wanted to see if the beneficial effects of exercise on mortality were changed if exercise was performed in a more polluted area. The basic findings were that exercising (mainly cycling in this paper) decreased your mortality risk regardless of how polluted the air was compared to those who did not exercise. They did some analysis on the amount of exercise done (supplementary table 1)  but they didn't have enough data to take anything from it really due to the nature of the questionnaire, so really this is a general exercise vs. no exercise.  Acute exposure to polluted air can decrease lung and vascular function (see pg 4 and 5 of the paper for refs) and chronic exposure is linked/causes increased respiratory and cardiovascular illness and mortality. In this paper they termed high pollution as over 19ug/m2 of NO2, which can cause oxidative stress in cells.   The benefits of exercise can include increased strength, mitochondrial density and endurance, additionally the mitochondria and cells are better able to resist oxidative stress (http://hyper.ahajournals.org/content/54/6/1206.full that's free access not the best source as it refers more to exercise with people with hypertension but the same effects are seen in healthy people). The better resistance to oxidative stress will enable you to better "resist" the pollutants in the air, improve vascular function etc.  There is obviously a balancing act, too much pollutant vs the benefits of exercise. The key thing to take into account is how long the exercise takes and how much your breathing rate increases. The intensity of exercise wasn't taken into account but if you say 15 breaths per min at rest and 45 breaths per min with exercise (that's intense exercise levels, 30 breaths per min might be a better number). In a week, you would have 151200 breaths with no exercise and 158400 breaths if you exercise for 4hrs at a very high intensity which is 4.75% more breaths/wk. That's a relatively small increase in breath no. for exercising intensely as a whole and given the more you exercise the better your cells should be able to resist oxidative stress it's not surprising that the benefits of exercise outweigh the slight increase in air intake. (Breath volume would increase with exercise too but that's really variable in people and the intense exercise breath rate should hopefully account for that).  An interesting study they reference is this one from Hong Kong http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17291575  Here the high levels of pollution are 6-times that in this study (120ug/m3 NO) and their minimum levels are the high level in the Copenhagen study. They see the same effect, exercise keeps you healthy even where smog is very high. It should be noted that they didn't specify that all exercise was outside in the smog but some of it would have been and they were exposed to way high levels. They also looked at what air pollutants correlate to disease, NO3, O3 and particulates below 10um had the most negative effects. The benefits of exercise were more pronounced with the high levels of pollution than the lower levels in the Copenhagen study.  **TL;DR:** The basic message is that exercise will keep you more healthy compared to not exercising. The benefits of exercise seem to increase in more polluted areas. If you can exercise somewhere away from pollution great but if you can't it shouldn't put you off because you think you might inhale more pollutants.

Haploinsufficiency of myostatin protects against aging-related declines in muscle function and enhances the longevity of mice
The paper is open access but here's the abstract:  The molecular mechanisms behind aging-related declines in muscle function are not well understood, but the growth factor myostatin (MSTN) appears to play an important role in this process. Additionally, epidemiological studies have identified a positive correlation between skeletal muscle mass and longevity. Given the role of myostatin in regulating muscle size, and the correlation between muscle mass and longevity, we tested the hypotheses that the deficiency of myostatin would protect oldest-old mice (2830 months old) from an aging-related loss in muscle size and contractility, and would extend the maximum lifespan of mice. We found that MSTN+/ and MSTN/ mice were protected from aging-related declines in muscle mass and contractility. While no differences were detected between MSTN+/+ and MSTN/ mice, MSTN+/ mice had an approximately 15% increase in maximal lifespan. These results suggest that targeting myostatin may protect against aging-related changes in skeletal muscle and contribute to enhanced longevity.
Here's the link to the paper it's open access so everyone can view it.  http://www.cell.com/cms/attachment/2027503261/2045933681/mmc2.pdf
How did you go from the British Empire to blindly supporting the US Government?
The difference between the EU and U.S. Cattle feed, antibiotic and hormone use has been shown to effect serum (basically blood without cells) and can impact biology research.   For example, In this paper tissue engineered muscles exposed to EU cow serum became fast muscle and US serum resulted in a slow muscle, though the specific factors causing the change were not identified.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25146978
Yep that's the one!  Here's a youtube playlist of it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQDxtzf-FDM list=PLE077061F6C197D71
By his peak I mean that I've not heard or seen a better performance than that show from him but sure he may go on to top that performance. In terms of him writing great stuff since I don't disagree and he'll go on making great music for a long time.  I've seen him twice since that show (last time in June 2014) plus several uploads on YouTube and music sites. The performances of Slow Dancing in a Burning Room, Belief and Vultures are far beyond any other versions I've heard him do since (obviously this is all subjective and I've not heard every live performance since then). Also the people he performed with that night Robbie McIntosh, Steve Jordan, Pino Palladino etc. and the chemistry he had with them was in my opinion something very special and would be incredibly hard to top but hopefully I'm wrong!
Came here to say John Mayer. I always thought he was some teen pop artist but goddam can he play a guitar! For anybody unsure of him watch or listen to Where the light is - Live in LA. it shows off his diversity, talent and in my opinions him at his peak.

New therapeutic target for myotonic dystrophy
FDA approved drug Epitholone B promotes significant spinal cord regeneration in mice.
Avoiding late-night eating reduces age-related heart decline (study in flies)
In the animal studies they used an oral garage which is basically a tube that delivers the drug directly to the stomach. Dasatanib was at a concentration of 5mg/kg and quercertin at 50mg/kg body weight, most likely they were dissolved in water but it might have been with a different solvent. That info is from page 8 of the paper.  There's no need to bind it RNA which I can't see making any difference unless it prevents it from degradation, if you let me know where it says that then I'll have a look as I skimmed through the paper to find the dosing info.
This is a summary and link of the paper (it's open access):  Summary The healthspan of mice is enhanced by killing senescent cells using a transgenic suicide gene. Achieving the same using small molecules would have a tremendous impact on quality of life and burden of age-related chronic diseases. Here, we describe the rationale for identification and validation of a new class of drugs termed senolytics, which selectively kill senescent cells. By transcript analysis, we discovered increased expression of pro-survival networks in senescent cells, consistent with their established resistance to apoptosis. Using siRNA to silence expression of key nodes of this network, including ephrins (EFNB1 or 3), PI3K, p21, BCL-xL, or plasminogen activated inhibitor-2, killed senescent cells, but not proliferating or quiescent, differentiated cells. Drugs targeting these factors selectively killed senescent cells. Dasatinib eliminated senescent human fat cell progenitors, while quercetin was more effective against senescent human endothelial cells and mouse BM-MSCs. The combination of dasatinib and quercetin was effective in eliminating senescent MEFs. In vivo, this combination reduced senescent cell burden in chronologically aged, radiation-exposed, and progeroid Ercc1-/ mice. In old mice, cardiac function and carotid vascular reactivity were improved 5 days after a single dose. Following irradiation of one limb in mice, a single dose led to improved exercise capacity for at least 7 months following drug treatment. Periodic drug administration extended healthspan in Ercc1-/ mice, delaying age-related symptoms and pathology, osteoporosis and loss of intervertebral disc proteoglycans. These results demonstrate the feasibility of selectively ablating senescent cells and the efficacy of senolytics for alleviating symptoms of frailty and extending healthspan.  http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acel.12344/abstract
Popular antioxidant Ubiquinone or Coenzyme Q10 does not function as antioxidant and ingestion likely has no effect
People are going to have a spectrum of adverse reactions (from minimal/few to severe) which is shown in the paper and at the moment can't be predicted. The only way to know how you'd react is to take the drug.   It should be noted that the extra year survival is compared to those who only take one antibody (i.e. trastuzumab and docetaxol). and is not compared to a no treatment control. The treatment that caused this extra year (i.e. pertuzumab,  trastuzumab and docetaxol) costs $120K/yr, A 2006 study showed that trastuzumab alone cost 70K/yr (see end for source), not sure what it is now but I assume a little less given the costs in this study. The antibodies are the expensive part of the treatment due to how they are manufactured and the associated research costs. If you have no treatment with this aggressive form of breast cancer you;re looking at 6-12 months, old school chemo gives you 18 months, trastuzumab gives you 36 months and this one 48 months - so in a way it's $120K/yr for 3yrs survival.   "Am I suffering in that last year of life?" - Yes in that last year as the adverse effects of cancer get stronger you will suffer but that is the same as if you didn't have treatment. There is some anecdotal evidence (based on discussions with oncologists and personal experience) that some of these targeted cancer therapies (i.e. the antibody) can result in a more rapid last stage of death which would decrease the time suffering at the end stage of cancer (that is based on renal carcinomas treated with sunitinib a VEGFR and PDGFR inhibitor). If that is true (it's anecdotal/based on doctors observations not saying it's fact) then you would expect to spend less time in a hospital or hospice in your last year compared to no treatment.  "Does the last year bankrupt my family or financially burden them?" - Possibly but you're not forced to have the treatment and is something you'd have to discuss with your family prior to starting treatment. The cost of these treatments are amazingly high, particularly in the US due to the healthcare system (i.e. direct hospital/physician costs) and the cost of the drugs themselves (due to research costs of the drug and to cover the costs of other drugs which don't make the grade). In the UK (where I'm from), there is debate about providing these treatments on the NHS (i.e. for free) and a "postcode lottery" sometimes exists where a treatment is available in some areas but not others. The cost effectiveness of trastuzumab treatment in France can be seen here: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19487912  The cost-benefit of this remains to be seen and unfortunately it won't be available for all due to the cost. Really, it's another treatment tool that can be used and in time as the costs decrease will be more widely available -  just like any other treatment.  2006 cost study: http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0 type=summary url=/journals/hastings_center_report/v036/36.3fleck.pdf
I think by "genetically predisposed" theathlete46 was referring to type I diabetics, who cannot produce insulin which is required to increase glucose uptake in muscle and brain. This treatment may help lower the dose of insulin they need to inject themselves with by increasing insulin sensitivity but they will still need to inject insulin to see the benefits of this potential treatment.  In terms of being predisposed and developing a disease being different things then I totally agree with you, I just interpreted the previous commentators differently :)
