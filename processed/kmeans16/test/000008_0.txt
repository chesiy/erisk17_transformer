Science AMAs are posted early to give readers a chance to ask questions and vote on the questions of others before the AMA starts.   Guests of /r/science have volunteered to answer questions; please treat them with due respect. Comment rules will be strictly enforced, and uncivil or rude behavior will result in a loss of privileges in /r/science.  If you have scientific expertise, please verify this with our moderators by getting your account flaired with the appropriate title.  Instructions for obtaining flair are here: [reddit Science Flair Instructions](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/wiki/flair) (Flair is automatically synced with /r/EverythingScience as well.)
I agree, actually, the admins need to actually do something, most of the time there is just no response.  having a fully open mod log would allow bad actors to laser focus on the person who just enforced a rule.  This already happens way too much.  If you respond to a mod mail to explain why something was removed, even though you didn't do the removal, you can end up being comment stalked, and doxxed.   I think there is a disconnect because users don't see the incredibly hostile messages the mods of big subreddits constantly get.  We have constant reminders of how terrible people can be.
of course.
Not really true either, since it was an application of one of our products, I was paid for being an R D scientist and I did an assessment of the area, your argument is bullshit, give it up.
