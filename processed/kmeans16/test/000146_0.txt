So... OP was in the bathroom while the cat, sitting on top of the toilet, "got into the shaving cream" as the title suggests, knocking it onto the floor and immediately divebombing on top of it as it explodes. Then, the cat decided to roll and thrash around in the same spot, ending up staring into a corner, and waited while OP got his/her phone out and took a picture.  That's probably what happened, right?  I can see why your cats look at you this way.
Flamed 'em.
/u/Lord_of_pie for ~~president~~ Head of State.
I just picked up /u/JawnDenver a couple weeks ago.
Nice. 76% wouldn't be enough for me to risk 100 coins for a reward of 3 though. That's almost a 1 in 4 shot of losing.
To stand like a tree in all its glory, strong against the wind.  A greater force has fallen o'er me, yet I try and try again.  A mighty Oak, strong and sturdy, is how I strive to live.  So I take a toke, I'm with my buds, but now it's time to rest.
That's why I'm glad my man Bernie identifies as Independent. Although he is going to have to chase the Democratic nomination to have a shot at winning, which is depressing in its own regard.
/u/test_subject4565 is a perv who lurks on /r/gonewild and talks about underage girls.  edit: He came after me so I checked his account. That's what he does on Reddit.   ^ What a clown. This is me ["coming after"](https://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/3dcse2/to_all_car_owners_that_gets_pissed_when_people/ct3xwb0?context=3) him. Get a life, loser.

Don't miss.
OP ded.
I actually just saw it today at a local used book store that I used to work at, while browsing. The owner goes to a lot of auctions and estate sales so they have stuff all over the place. I am probably going to go back and buy it tomorrow, because he'll probably give it to me for around $10. Either way, I will certainly snap a photo(s) of it and post some links. It's quite an interesting piece.   The style of the crown itself was more identical to the first one you linked to.
I assume you were trying to make a joke based on my *duration* in bed. Quite wrong, lad. You are however correct about the speed. I hump like a jackrabbit. Ask your mom...
I think the premise is that Hell is soo terrible that even something as insignificant as a spoon will provide at least a menial mental distraction from the torture you are being subjected to.
Not disagreeing with the efficiency of nuclear energy. I was comparing renewable energy to fossil fuel energy. Just as there is a hard limit on how much power you can generate from a finite area, there is also a hard limit of how much oil you can suck out of a given oil field.   The fact is that it shouldn't matter how much paper money it costs to make something happen when were talking about ending the irreparable harm we've been causing to the Earth (the one and only planet we live on) by drilling, spilling, and burning these oils and refined fuels.    Edit: Typo
In that case, you must be hungry. Hit up Jims Steaks @ 4th and South.   Wiz wit, lettuce, mayo, salt   pepper. Do it.  Edit: BTW, you may get a better response rate over at /r/philadelphia. Not many people subscribe to this sub.
