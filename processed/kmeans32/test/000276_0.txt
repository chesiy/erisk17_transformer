They started Rusty Lisch for a game back in the 80s. He's been deemed the worst NFL player of all time. He got pulled for Payton.
Whedon had wanted to do it in the first episode but didn't have the budget, this was 6 seasons later so he had a chance to do it then.
Yes please.

That song gives me ptsd.
Someone's never listened to Jessie J. She pretty explicitly says it's not about the money.
It wouldn't be the [first time he tried something like that.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OD380XDs-NY)
I swear half the songs off Blinks first 3 albums are about sex. And that's probably a conservative estimate. This is a band that wrote a song about Ben Wah Balls for fucks sake.
I've never seen as many dirty blocks by one team as I have by the Niumatalolo led Navy teams. And I understand how the academies have to play, I don't have anything against that. It makes me prefer we didn't play them, but I don't hold it against them. My issue is that it seems like every year there's at least 1-2 plays like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcTaRThg2mQ).
With current technology, who's still worried about missing a show? 10 years ago I'd understand, but we have dvr and Hulu. No reason to skip out unless it's something live (sports being the only reason I have cable really).
He's actually having a pretty good year. Not lighting it up, but he's an ILB, so not a position where you make a ton of plays.
I wouldn't put us as a top 3 job. The tradition is great, and depending on the recruit and/or their parents, the quality of education can be a huge boon. On the other hand, for a school with as much success as we've had, there's a lot of recruits we can't even attempt to go after, because they won't be able to get in. Not only that, we don't have any "athlete majors" where athletes can slack off and do nothing. Combine that with needing to recruit much more nationally, I still think it's a great job, probably top 10 or so, but not top 3 by any stretch.
So are the other 2.
I could see that if it were the Beatles or Michael Jackson, or someone equally big. I'm not sure the Beastie Boys are quite big enough to be listened to 250 years from now. Sabotage never even made it onto the Billboard Hot 100.
My favorite Gunner Kiel moment was at one point he tweeted something and ended it with #GunnerKielQuotes . Alpha move right there.
To be honest, though, even without the rule, a top 8 Notre Dame is going to a BCS bowl. Honestly a top 12 Notre Dame probably is. That has nothing to do with a sweetheart deal with the BCS, and everything to do with our fanbase. The same is true of an at large Texas or Alabama or USC or Ohio State. Financially it just makes more sense for the bowls to take those schools.
I know a lot of guys that age that buy it. It's health conscious people who don't normally drink soda, but want to mix drinks.  Can't mix rum with water. In the words of my friend who tried "It retains none of the flavor and all of the what the fuck".
One of the things KLM said that I feel needs to be clarified is that Tommy wasn't getting booed last year when he came into games. There were boos, yes, but those were at Kelly, for what was perceived as giving up on Golson. We'd just seen Dayne Crist removed after a half the year before, we wanted Kelly to give someone else a shot. Tommy Rees for the last 2 years felt like a crutch for Kelly. A nice safe QB that can get 7-9 wins on a decent team. Those aren't the seasons we play for though. As a student body, at least, there's been nothing but respect for Tommy Rees. Do people wish we had a better QB, absolutely, but that doesn't take away anything that he accomplishes. He's part of the ND family, and nothing's going to change that.
Shit, I was hoping for a nice easy win.
I choose to believe you're not married and are actually going out to find a wife, not that you are and she's in another room or something.

You say no to ratchet pussy, JuicyJ can't!
In all honesty this may have killed any notion of us ever joining the B1G. It wasn't that likely anyway, but it was definitely going to be up for a lot of consideration if it ever became necessary to join a conference for football.  However, given the history of feelings such as this, going all the way back to Yost and his telling us we couldn't join because we were Catholic, it just seems unlikely.
He needs a new accountant if he's paying 37% on 70k a year.
A kid I went to high school with's sister did Girls Gone Wild. She apparently made it into the commercial for that one, too. So he, his sister, and his parents are watching something like Comedy Central late at night and the commercial comes on. He sees his sister, looks over at his family, and walks out and goes to bed. He never asked about anything after that.
I agree. Just because someone with a suit can pull off a fedora, doesn't mean they looked better with them on. Even then, they were for function. It was just the acceptable hat to wear with a suit.
Yeah Sampson got a few guys likes Gordon, but a huge issue was that for most part his guys weren't serious about basketball. He was essentially running a program like Blue Mountain State. The only guys who weren't getting stoned and drunk all the time his last year were Gordon and White, which is part of the reason neither came back. And why a lot of the guys in state weren't considering it.  Side note, posts like these just remind me of how much talent the state produces. I think half my high school's losses while I was there were to nba lottery picks.
Yeah I got eliminated from valedictorian my first semester of high school when I took electives. The salutatorian was 2nd because he accidentally took an extra art class freshman year.
And so stylish.

I think it's hilarious. I've been waiting for something to come out because I knew he wasn't actually dating her. He was dating someone else at the time. He even just called her a friend early on I believe. This probably led to less shock when it all came out. Though I'd never have guessed she didn't exist. I'm pretty sure he was in on it to some degree due to rumblings I've heard, but to what I'm not sure.  As for ND fans in general, the student body seems to be pretty skeptical of him, the rest of the fan base who doesn't know him as well is pretty much buying his story entirely.
Hell I think it's hilarious. I've been waiting for something to come out about this whole thing for months. I knew he wasn't actually dating her, never would have guessed she wasn't a person.
