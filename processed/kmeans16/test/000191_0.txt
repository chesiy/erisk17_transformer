[Question] TaiG won't recognize iTunes?   I'm trying to jailbreak my iphone 5s running on 8.4 but the TaiG installer is telling me "Apple driver hasn't been found. Please download and install iTunes". I don't really feel like re-installing itunes and having to go through ratings and playlists again. Does anyone know of a fix for this?
In my mind its simple, it is a dwarf planet, based upon new information that wasn't available when it was first discovered. Things change, we have to adapt. If you still consider Pluto a planet, why? (besides the fact that you like it, or want it to be a planet, that holds no scientific meaning)
Do you have any recommendations for beginner programs? I have been lifting since last september though, but not too seriously until a few months ago when I finished school and started the cut, and have seen some good muscle developments and have been able to increase what I'm lifting despite eating at the deficit.

Axial tilts of planets   I'm getting a tattoo soon of the solar system and am including a line in each planet to indicate the direction of their axial tilt. using this picture as reference http://rossmannellcomments.edublogs.org/files/2013/12/Planetary-Axial-Tilts-1qtzpi8.jpg can i make the angles negative? so instead of Earth being 23.4 degrees away from the sun, can it be 23.4 degrees pointing towards the sun? I'm assuming yes because that is what happens during summer, but just wanted to make sure. Thanks!

Laminate that looks like granite. Don't care about cost really, I'm just looking for what style/colour will go well. It's a medium size area, my entire kitchen countertop.
