Anyone spot Peter Prodromou at 50s in?  Want to remain anonymous? Top tip: don't wear overalls with your name on the back :-)  Still, seemed to do pretty well against the might of Fred on a rampage!
Laughing hard here. Awesome!
I'd be interested to know how enforceable they are, actually. After all, if your contract says "You are not allowed to make sandwiches for a competitor for 2 years" but the only thing you know how to do is make sandwiches, then the contract is effectively denying you your livelihood. In the US, the contract would probably win, but in the UK, it would not.  I guess it would be argued that all three of them (but especially Clarkson) /have/ done non-automotive related shows before and they could make a living doing something else for a couple of years, but I'd very much doubt it. On the other hand, if it meant Clarkson was forced to spend two years making more war documentaries, then I'm all for it :)
Yup, same here: http://i.imgur.com/m9LExde.png
Seriously?
Nah, it's just a programme about cars where the three blokes who make it are moving on and some other bloke will start again next year. Stuff changes, and it really isn't worth over dramatising. In fact, I'm pretty sure that a BBC trail for Gardener's World or some such would probably fit well with previous comments made by the (now old) team regarding not over dramatising such matters.  Now if you want a /proper/ ending, try the last episode of Blackadder 4...they certainly didn't talk over that one!
Err, I have a 1TB SSD in my laptop and have done for well over a year now. Quite cheap now too :-)  Seriously, for general OS use, there is simply no comparison and if you do any "real" work (I'm a DBA) they are 100x quicker than spinning rust.  I get your reliability concerns, but spinning disks fail too and in a laptop are much more sensitive to shocks. Running a regular disk does not mean you don't need to run backups!
Looks like a hand-egg to my eyes...
What elephant?
I find a computer to be indispensable:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=043WEs_6TAo
Nope. So much nope.
Didn't Kvyat manage to cross the line?
Does anyone have any feedback on how good, technically, this kit is?  Looking at the raincoat and softshells, which are upwards of 100, there's very little information on what they are made from. If I was buying in a shop, I'd probably expect gore-tex or Windstopper type materials at that price....  Obviously, I'd expect the very best here, especially as they are being subsidised by the sponsors' logos ;-)
Actually, I'm assuming that long term we'd see RB pull out of racing (Toro Rossi to Renault? RB to Audi?) and they'd be left just running the sport....like they do for loads and loads of other niche activity sports. The Red Bull Air Race series is properly cool and in case you've not checked, the city venues read like an F1 wishlist!   Who do you prefer? The Red Bull F1 Championship run by someone who has proven track record in actually caring what the spectacle looks like, or the CVC F1 Championship, run 100% to make money for CVC, without exception.  I think I know which seat my backside is sat on!
TIFU by getting up at 5am to watch the race when I should have just watched the highlights in the evening.  Honestly, you missed nothing by being knocked unconscious. This race sucked :-/
Actually, I'm semiserious here...  We threw EMC out and replaced it with Compellent about 3 years ago and have never looked back. Its cracking kit and does stuff that EMC are still dreaming about.  We've got about 800TB across 4 arrays now and love it :-)
Heh, I've just reread your comment and that is indeed what you said!  Damn, just woke up and brain must have been addled.  Can I have a downvote for my OP please ? :-)
Down doobie do down down...
Or, to give a slightly more positive spin, they get to take some very well loved characters and place them into a different universe to allow us, the movie-goers, to experience how life might be for them if things didn't entirely follow Roddenberry's idealistic path.  Its an interesting idea and one I'm happy to watch play out.
for private plates you have to renew every year and if you don't it reverts back to the original plate number   Just to be a pedant, this isn't actually true.   Private plates on /retention/ (that is, not on a car but rather on a piece of paper) have to be renewed annually, but private plates on a car remain with the car for life, or until the owner transfers it away to another car (or retention). If you sell the car, the plates go with it and, in fact, its been known for cheap cars to change hands at inflated prices so the buyer can transfer the plate into his Merc ;-)
How awful :-(  It sounds like the driver was unconscious at the time. Not sure of his condition, but if it were me, I'm not sure I'd want to come back...
Errr, it is.  Great Britain, typically referred to as "Britain" includes Scotland and thus Glasgow. Of course you could have also been referring to The United Kingdom and of course that too includes Glasgow (they voted for that and everything!)  Leaving this aside, nasty scenes in Glasgow that I don't think anyone, North or South of the border wants to see :-/
Err, its the 25th November.... Early?
Start any conversation with a stranger by apologising:  "Sorry to bother you, but..." "Excuse me, can I.." "Pardon me, but..." "I'm very sorry to disturb you, but...."
And presumably you have no frame of reference....
The two abreast thing is interesting. I have my own take on this as a cyclist:  1) If I'm riding with a friend, we ride side by side 2) If a car comes up behind, we'll move over 3) If I'm riding on my own in a place where I deem it to be unsafe to be overtaken, I'll ride in the middle of the road and the car must wait until I say he can overtake. I then move in. I don't allow myself to be squeezed into the verge, and make myself as wide as I need to to prevent it.  And you know, I've had very few problems with (3). Most drivers are content to be told when it's safe to pass and I've possibly saved myself being shoved into the dirt any number of times due to "optimistic overtaking".  As evidence, I present....me! Not dead, too :-)
France loves chips (fries, if you're a Merkin). In Belgium they are more or less the national dish.  Yes, European food tends to be more realistically sized, but chips for every meal does nothing for the waistline!  Source: my fat ass in France.
Actually, much of Clue isn't actually made up on the spot and this line clearly wasn't, but it's very fair to say that those who think quickest do best and that the funniest bits are the off-script parts.  Look up "Lyttleton's Britain", a collection of Humph's introductions by the man who actually wrote many of them, Iain Pattinson. Hilarious read.
I'm such a rebel! ;-)
On the day this was released, my then girlfriend and I noticed that the cover image was a painting held at a museum in Manchester (UK, to avoid confusion). We immediately skipped lectures and went to find it.  In short, it was in storage but the nice lady at the museum desk was slightly surprised that a few people had come in that day asking about the same obscure painting.  Still think fondly of this with my uni years. It's always been a favourite of mine and I still think it's Weezer's best album...

Yup, this is kinda why I've never understood the hang up that people have over the licence fee. If you assume its a mandated tax (it isn't, but hey...) then it's some of the best value you'll ever see for that money.  Personally, I see no reason to pay for satellite or cable - I'm not a big TV watcher anyway and find that nearly everything I enjoy watching comes from the BBC anyway, so I don't see the point in paying for a much wider range of stuff I don't want to see anyway.  Check out Luther or The Escape Artist, both of which are excellent drama series. We're also enjoying The Paradise, which is a more traditional costume drama on its second series now.  There's also a convincing argument that Sherlock is worth the licence fee all on its own... :-)
