Yea, I know what you're talking about. I definitely get that "click of a switch" feeling.   It's not that there aren't people around who like you, it's that there aren't many people who think the same way as you. I don't think many people think about weighty subjects like; existence, religion and political ideologies that often.  I know that I think about those things a lot. So much so that it's almost as though I have a huge part of me that few people see. It's like there's a side of me that I hold back from most people, because they aren't interested in seeing it or are unable to engage it. Lately, I've been noticing how few people have serious opinions or have ideas that are important to them, and it makes me feel very detached. I can be in a crowd of people who like me, and have a great time with them talking about superficial things, but when I think about how much I internalize it makes me feel alone.
It really helps hide how much oatmeal there is in a smoothie. I usually put oatmeal and milk in the blender first, then I put a banana in and blend those three together, and once that's almost pureed I put in mix fruits and sometime some peanut butter.
Whenever I get "stuck in my head" (as my friends and family have started calling it) I look at the ground. I just completely check out and let my thoughts go, and I'm only vaguely aware of what's happening around me when I'm thinking like that. I've had to make a conscious effort to walk with my head up and shoulders back, so that it looks like I have some self-esteem haha.
I know! haha I've just got to go to relax about it, but I think I'm still getting over getting this attention in the first place.
He seems like a good example of an unhealthy infj
More or less. I think the social functions of both are very different.
I'm going to school for journalism and creative writing. I've become very interested in story crafting and film, so I may go to film school when I'm done my degree.
Yeah it definitely feels like a fog, and it makes it difficult to connect to other people. I haven't always been this way, because I can remember having my emotions flow normally. When I sit down and think and try to relax I have an easier time identifying how I'm feeling and becoming grounded in the moment, but it takes conscious effort.
Yeah I definitely did it with the appropriate body language and chuckling. I wasn't just mumbling to myself or anything. I just felt (like always) that I could have dealt with the situation better, I need to think on my toes more.
Yes definitely, if I don't receive a diagnosis there are still a lot of things that I need to work on personally. I know that I have trouble socializing with people sometimes, I have a lot of anxiety, and I struggle with some obsessive tendencies. I'm really looking into Asperger's because it could explain a lot and as far as I'm concerned it's something that either is on the table or isn't, but I need to know moving forward. If I an aspie then there are some realities that I'll need to work with, if I'm not, then there are other reasons for some of my characteristics that I need to explore.   I've been trying to find reasons and solutions for some of the things that are causing problems in my life. I don't think there's any harm in taking a look at the possibility of being asperger's. If I am I learn something about myself and move forward in one direction, if I'm not then I'll reassess somethings and move forward in a different direction.
I think Into the Wild is close to what I'd consider an INFJ movie. I've that there are more films that involve similar themes in foreign cinema. Wim Wender's film Der Himmel Uber Berlin (Wings of Desire) and the films of Andrei Tarkvosky spring to mind. If you're the kind of person who doesn't mind subtitles then I'd recommend giving those a watch.   For english movies I'd say that Spike Jonze and Wes Anderson are two directors who explore a lot of themes that INFJs can relate to. Where the Wild Things Are is one of the best children's films I've seen.
Got my medication reduced! third day on coming down from 45mg to 15 mg of Mirtazapine and I'm in a weird mood. Have any of you experienced mood changes while switching doses?   So I've got my prescription reduced from 45 mg every night to 15 mg. This is the third day on the lower dose, and I think I'm still adjusting because I've been in a funny mood. I've all the sudden become really judgemental, but unlike before I'm not teetering on despair. It's like being lucidly aware of being in a crappy mood, so I'm sort of laughing about it.  I'm being a bit more outwardly negative, but I only feel a little bit worse than I did before. I was wondering if any of you have experienced anything similar when switching doses.
I'm like you, I can make easy banter with strangers almost no problem but friends/acquaintances/people I'd like to get to know I have more of a problem with. I think that the anonymity of talking to strangers takes off that social pressure edge and allows me to be a witty, flirty and overall charming person. When with friends on the other hand I feel like its some sort of serious balancing act. I'm always questioning how I should say things; is the conversation going to be idle chit chat or are we going to discuss our lives and feelings, what things should I keep to myself, should I ask some more personal questions? I feel like when I'm invested in another person I have this pressure to impress.   I think trying to strike a balance between casual conversation with friends, and real deep meaningful conversation is really important and easier said than done. Personally I've had relationships turn to only deep conversation and each time I'd hang out with those people everything seemed really melancholy. I love engaging, in-depth conversations, but I've tried to limit how much I have them lately. They can always lead to someone getting offended or it becoming a bit of an argument if your not careful. If someone else initiates them I'll give take part, but I usually don't bring weighty stuff to the table anymore because it makes most people uncomfortable.   Small talk isn't usually really about anything in my experience, it's more about socializing with other people, reading their body language making them laugh that kind of thing. It's more of a go with the flow kind of social bonding. I think often there's more socializing going on when people participate in small talk than when people are talking about weighty things.
Lately I've been messing up my speech and feeling  self conscious about everything I say. How do I get this under control?   Lately I've been trying to improve my banter with other people but its made my interactions so awkward I barely want to leave my house. Its like I'm analyzing my own thoughts and speech as I'm talking. Its making me trip over really simple sentences, or give really long explanations for simple things because I'm in overdrive trying to think of what would be the best way to say something.   I'm want to be more confident and comfortable in the way I interact with others. I'm trying to watch what I say, keep things casual, banter, and be funny, but by trying to be more savvy with what I say and how I interact I'm messing up more than ever. Really I try to think of the best way to respond in a conversation, but the overanalysis is just weighing me down. At the same time if I don't pay attention to what I'm saying I'll say something stupid.  For example a coworker the other day mentioned that it was Mother's day in the UK and said she'd wished her Mom happy Mother's day. I knew she had lived in the UK for a few years so it wasn't completely random, but all I could come up with was asking her if there were any other "holidays" that were different there then in North America. That's a stupid question, I probably should have asked her something like if she's still doing something for her Mom for north american mother's day or something like that. Later she was talking about some neat little piece of tupperware she had and all I did was say it was neat  and that I probably need to start collecting neat little things like that because I'll be moving out on my own soon.   Those are just two examples, they don't seem too awkward there but it was weird stilted conversation. On top of that anytime that I open my mouth I feel I need to psych myself up and what comes out is usually just really confused speech. Like trying to talk to one of the registrars at my university about a form I lost myself mid sentence and pretty much had to apologize and start over. I don't know what to do, it's like there's a mess between my brain and my mouth and I can't fix it.  Anybody got any ideas?
She's the only complaint I've had.
Let me count the list of things my ex said to me in a single breakup conversation.  - I only stayed with you because I was afraid of being alone.  - There's someone else, I cheated on you.  - I don't think I've ever been attracted to you.  - My parents think you're lazy and don't think you're good enough (translate: I think you're lazy and aren't good enough)   - Sex with you always hurt, sex with other guy doesn't  - I don't know why you're so beaten up, I'm not going to lose any sleep over this.  - You were my best friend   Great things to hear from the closest person in your life especially when dealing with depression.
In my personal experience, I had huge level of existential anxiety before my current depression. I'd say that I went through an "existential crisis" that was on and off for about half a year, the depression really started when I began applying it to my life.   All that being said, I'm sure that it can happen the other way too.
Yeah I think it's one of the biggest things that should be discussed in the depression community. I walked around j for months absolutely frustrated and resentful, then had a month or two with a very bad temper.  It's definitely a bit of a different beast and I think it would help a lot of guys dealing with depression to know that male depression can differ from female depression pretty drastically. Males are far more likely to become consumed in work/school and try to distract themselves by running themselves ragged. Males are also much more likely to channel their depression into anger than necessarily despair.
I spent about a year on a high horse because I started using biting ice cold rational to criticize basically the way most people go on with their lives. We entertain and distract ourselves to death and I refused to participate for almost a year. I tried to better myself because the only other course of action was passivity. My rationale was supported by a lot of academic research and personal experience. Having this depressing hypercritical worldview did make me quite the elitist because no one else would bother to do the research and work that I'd done to achieve what appears to be so evident.  I'm not sure what to make of my ideas anymore, they seem true and seem like the right course of action, but they isolated me from all my friends and loved ones. I've now decided to tone myself down so that maybe I can be happy again someday.
I will agree with other posters that your boyfriend's behaviour is unacceptably invasive, but at the same time I do, as a man, sympathize with that kind of insecurity. I'm of the school of thought that most single males have less than platonic goals if they start showing interest in a girl who is in a relationship. It's an easy assumption and more often than not it's right.   All that being said you're boyfriend is obviously not just being the normal level of defensive, he's taking it way too far. You shouldn't have to show him all the past of your electronic communication if you don't want to, that's a boundary that you've set.  I'm not usually one to dish out the "break up" advice which is often given ad nauseum on this subreddt, but if your boyfriend doesn't seriously take your feelings on this into consideration and continues to freak out, I don't think you'll have many more directions to take. If you've communicated your issue with his behaviour to him, and he hasn't tried to compromise to achieve a healthy middle ground than it's probably time to move on.  This is coming from someone who's ex-girlfriend actually left me for a "guy friend" so I hope that I'm a tempered response.
wasn't indoors, was next to the garage. still bad.
You're entirely right.
Yeah I did the same thing, it was always trying to push it as far down as possible. I think that by doing so at a young age it actually caused my depression to be worse now. I can remember doing some things in school that were really not alright, and just biting my tongue so I didn't cry sometimes. I've been trying to work very hard at exercising as a way of wasting the energy those negative emotions cause.   I'm really sorry to hear that you have a problem that makes exercising dangerous. I can't imagine how I'd manage without.
about a week and a half.
Has your depression made you bitter and jaded to people/events?    My depression has definitely left me a bitter and less empathetic person than I was before I became depressed. I've become sort of dismissive of most things that other people seem to get very swept up in. I honestly have admitted to myself that I don't have the emotional resources to care about what happens in the rest of the world anymore. I know it's not good that there is war in Syria and drought in Africa, but I just find myself not giving a damn. I actually have started thinking that most peoples empathy for these sort of things is just a big show they put on.   For example, with the whole Kony 2012 thing, I ripped into that like there was no tomorrow, being bitter and jaded at what seemed like sentimental schlock. It wouldn't usually bother me, I'd ignore it and let it go, but I actually went to the booth some students had set up at my college and basically drilled them to see if they knew what they were talking about, mostly they didn't.   I don't know, I just feel more bitter, jaded, and down right cynical than ever. Do any of you get the same thing?
Yeah we've talked about it quite a bit now, and have decided to talk on a semi regular basis. This was her idea not mine, I've already told her I have no idea why she'd want to speak to me again. So I guess that's good, she's the one who is really pushing to continue at least a friendship. Though I'm not trying to use the depression as an excuse, I think it's fair to say that I only ever behaved in that way while depressed, never before or after. She says that it doesn't bother her and that it's nice that there's some explanation there.
Yeah, I went in again to have a visit with the psychiatrist I've been seeing, he was able to better explain what he thought my issues are. I'm still not 100% on it, because I know I've had weird hyper/irritable episodes in the past, but he said most of them seem to be driven by anxiety rather than a mood state. I'm going to keep an eye out for symptoms regardless, and I've been mood charting for the depression that I have been diagnosed with, so I guess time will tell. Thanks for the response.
Some have an evening, others have lasted about a month.
Actually I brought this movie to my exgirlfriend, saying how amused I was at the concept. That's when I realized I'd become one seriously bitter, angry, misanthrope, and it wasn't 3 months later that I started going to therapy.   edit: I suppose I should actually reply to your ideas. I've learned not to hate the people who I think are awful and greedy, most of the time they don't know any better. Is it something to lament? yes, is it something I can change? probably not. You see, the world has become a very ugly place, and, I believe, people by and large have also become that way. We live in a world where there are weapons that can destroy whole cities in the blink of an eye. The situation, overall, has become rather bleak, cheap, and ugly, and many people have adapted to reflect this. There are reasons why I find art so lacking in it's ability to provide me comfort or catharsis, it's because there is no group of words, images, or notes that can extinguish the existential anguish that comes from living in our time. A time when everything could be moving toward a hopeful, beautiful future full of peace and promise, but so often falls short of that ideal.  So, while I used to resent those who act horribly or choose to distract themselves and ignore, I now simply lament the state of things.
This is some excellent advice. My intelligence has made me bitter and jaded, I'm unfortunately a bit of an idealist so when the world doesn't live up to my ideals I become bitter about it. It's something I've really come to terms with, that it is better to be humble and kind than intelligent and cold. I hope it is something that I only get better at as I get older. That being said I really need to work on myself socially as I still see social interaction as a mechanical thing that other people find organic.
already did, looking for wider feedback.
Lost my mind with severe undiagnosed depression turned into a nightmare SO. I think my ex deserves an explanation, I don't know what I should do.   Me and my ex dated for 2.5 years we broke up in april; before we started dating we'd been friends for 3 years I'm 20, she's 21. I didn't take care of myself and I treated her like garbage. She has so many completely valid reasons to never want to speak to me again. I became completely focused on school without any regard to anything else, it was all I could handle. I had what I would call an existential crisis that triggered clinical depression. I went to a counsellor early on when i was feeling a lot of anxiety, they told me I should speak with a philosopher. I wasn't sleeping at night, wasn't eating, was missing showering every other day, and falling asleep in the afternoon or in class. Lost interest in everything I enjoy, was a snob to my friends, and walked around with a chip on my shoulder.   I did so many things that were absolutely crazy, and obviously signs that something was seriously wrong with me, but I didn't do anything about it at the time. I became a complete misanthrope, I hated everybody and criticized everyone including her parents. I became dependent on her. In the last few months we ended up fighting a lot and I almost hit her, like raised my hand and said I wanted to, but didn't. I did end up shoving her once. I'm so ashamed about what happened. But wait there's more. I became kind of semi-controlling and I was jealous of one of her guy friends, who I probably was right about but I let how I felt affect me too much. I definitely crossed the line with that too, I just felt like I wasn't good enough at all. I didn't do enough for her birthday and valentine's day. It was just dinner, flowers, and a gift but I felt I should have done more. During all of this I was spending a lot of time playing video games because without realizing it I couldn't deal with my own life.  During a panic attack I had I almost cut myself, I've never done something like that before it was crazy, she stopped me from doing that. I was off handedly mentioning killing myself like an "maybe I should just kill myself then I wouldn't have to deal with" ____ whatever problem I was having.   After she broke up with me at the end of the school year, I didn't leave my apartment for 2 weeks, I just cried. I couldn't piece things together, I didn't talk to anyone I was just dead. It took me a month to realize how messed up I had been. I've since gone in and had pscyhiatric assessment done. I've been diagnosed with severe major depression. I'm seeing a therapist and am on medication.  I've never been like this before, I've always been a patient, caring and loving person. I was the one who could take the pressure in our relationship, but I lost it. This past year has been so out of character it's difficult to describe. Apparently my friend's and family has been very worried about me but didn't say anything.  Me and my ex haven't been speaking very often since the break up. She wanted to stay friends (for some reason I don't understand) but I told her that we both needed space. She said that she'd be there if I needed anything. I told her I wouldn't. Anyway, now I've dropped out of college for this year while I get my head back together.   Do you think that I should tell this girl why I acted the way I did? I'm feel so ashamed about what's happened, I have a hard time believing it myself.  She was my best friend for five years and the last 9 months have completely ruined that.   TL;DR: I've been diagnosed with severe depression. I've acted like a monster for almost a year, my ex left me with good reason. I feel like I should talk to my ex and at least give her an explanation for why I acted the way I did.
