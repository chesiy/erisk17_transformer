[Not exactly the same picture, but it is close. And much bigger.](http://i.imgur.com/wOPNTbc.jpg)  [Here's another one that is pretty cool](http://i.imgur.com/yPaMnuR.jpg)
How did "knife" used to be pronounced. K-nife? Forgive me I'm not a linguist so I don't know anything about phonetic spelling.
I remember reading a very in depth and interesting article on the issues that have arose with the wheels of one of the rovers(not 100% sure which it was). Basically the back left wheel has accrued over the years pretty sizeable hole so NASA actually begun to only drive the rover backwards to limit the risk of allowing the hole to continue to get bigger and eventually to cripple the poor rover. I always assumed this meant some NASA scientist had to manually drive the rover backwards but I guess it does make more sense to just change the programming. Although I'm not sure this is the case because the sensors are obviously designed for sensing forward not backward. Do you happen to know if in this special case the rover is still moved autonomously?

We must focus on camping, for in tents purposes.
Yep. Worked at freebirds for 3 or 4 months. Ate there every single day and still do all the time. In other words nothing even the least bit shady or unsanitary happened at all. I can roll a sexy ass burrito now too.
Dude I can't believe they did that. Tripping at the Oscars while wearing a dress would be a little too much for me and I'm pretty well acquainted with acid. [You can see Trey almost lose it for a second in the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsvQuJmASSk#t=103), I can only imagine the feeling. Before I knew the story, I didn't think it was possible to respect them more than I did but I was wrong. They're at the very top of my list of living people to trip with for sure.
Been listening to all of these and loving pretty much all of them. Since apparently we have the same taste in music I'm gonna be so bold as to recommend some bands/songs to you its only fair. I'm sure you've hear some of these.   John Butler Trio- Better Than, Used to get High, Ocean ( absolutely amazing solo instrumental on a 12 string. Actually watch [this live performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYJf_ybyVo), to fully appreciate just how fucking good he is)  Dispatch- The General   Sea Wolf- Middle Distance Runner   Iron   Wine - Boy with a coin   Matt Costa- Mr. Pitiful   Jose Gonzalez- Heartbeats   Two Door Cinema Club- SOmething good can work   Dr Dog- Heart it races James Yulli- No surpise  Actually you know what feel free to check out [my grooveshark playlist](http://grooveshark.com/playlist/1111/103994753). It has all of these songs and more, pretty much all my favorite songs right now.  Edit: Feel free to check out [this playlist](http://grooveshark.com/playlist/11New/98252792)t too, some overlap but for the most part this is all my favorite songs from back in the summer.
Yeah man, I'm a somewhat quiet guy, I've only been asked this like a single time luckily.   I think you just gotta answer confidently with something like this 'I'm one of those people who will talk your ear off if you get to know me but it takes me a little bit for me to warm up to groups of people'. or 'I dunno man, guess I'm just one of those people who only talks when I actually have something to say'.   If the person who asks you is an asshole who talks to an excess and it seem like they are insulting you this one is a bit less nice  'Well I'm one of those people who only talks when *I actually have something to add to the conversation*'
I know but many times it is not the highest upvoted reply to the comment so it is fairly far down the line from where the link was posted. This would just make things a bit more streamlined and when I saw the feature in ReddHub I thought it would be really cool in RES too.
Not to mention we are just now starting the 'biological revolution', what with understanding (kind of) how genetics works and with the abilities to interface machines and our bodies. At least as a biomedical engineer with research experience in bioinformatics and computational genomics I think that this will be the next digital revolution and right now we can't even comprehend what will be possible in the next few decades in this field. Kind of like how many people in the 60s and 70s could not possibly have fathomed the smartphone I am using to communicate to people halfway across the world right now.
Good point, if you can land on a not quite stationary barge in the middle of an ocean you can do a land landing with ease. It's a test of sorts and lets them tweak the process to ensure the safety of landing that are near cities and populated areas.

I want to be incredibly angry with Spencer for this situation and though he definitely deserves some blame, he put his own life at risk to help save people in an impoverished African nation despite there being no monetary incentives. He was over there doing something I would never dare to do and when shit finally hit  the fan, his response, probably unconscious self-denial, was just so human I can't help but empathize with him. It's easy to sit here at my computer and watch this unfold far removed from the actual event and say what an asshole how could he let something like this happen but then I think this was a good, selfless human being who volunteered his time doing something incredibly noble for people halfway around the world who he had never met and had nothing to offer but their thanks. Not only that  but he knew a shitload more about the disease than I do or any of the public does as well, he knew what was at stake but still acted this way. Here we have a seemingly incredibly compassionate and giving person act in way that is at the very least negligent and unintentionally malicious to the entirety of his home country. Fuck ebola.
As the old cliche goes, doctors are the worst patients. Honestly no matter how smart you are, no matter how much you know about a disease subconsciously I just don't think anyone can possibly be prepared to accept that you have a disease with a 50-70% mortality rate and very possibly will die within 2-3 weeks. I imagine this doctor did some Olympics level mental gymnastics to convince himself that it was just the flu or something. I also bet you anything he's had scares like this before, maybe not a temperature this high but possibly a minor fever that he ended up getting all worked up about which turned out to be nothing serious. Put all this together and you get a very knowledgeable person behaving in an utterly irrational and even criminally negligent manner.
Actually the studies on Ebola were minimal until this current outbreak. Not many labs have the abilities to test on BSL4 level pathogens and there was little reason to do this as there was a belief that ebola would burn itself out before killing more than 20-100 people because that had happened multiple times already.   I directly work with someone who is at the CDC 4 days a week working on Ebola. I know what they know and I know how smart they are. They are still people though they are not on a whole other planet they are on earth, literally and figuratively. I am up to date on the vast majority of published scientific studies on the matter and believe me there is a lto of debate in the scientific community over certain specifics. I'm sure the CDC has some material which is not publically published in scientific journals but they aren't that far ahead. it is in their interests to keep the rest of the community up to date. Like I said, I said the more you learn the more you learn what you don't know.
That's definitely true. I that the expectation of the public that a serious epidemic would be like the movies instead of something gradual over years along with the notion the government is this omnipowerful agency and not something human and fallible can't help either. Before all of this that's sure what I thought. If you had shown me a movie depicting these exact circumstances a year ago it would have made me roll my eyes. I would have thought how the patient was handled in Dallas was a completely ridiculous scenario and government ineptitude like that would never happen in real life.
Complete bullshit as thumbnails are fair use.  Here's the precedent: Fair use. A search engines practice of creating small reproductions (thumbnails) of images and placing them on its own website (known as inlining) did not undermine the potential market for the sale or licensing of those images. Important factors: The thumbnails were much smaller and of much poorer quality than the original photos and served to help the public access the images by indexing them. (Kelly v. Arriba-Soft, 336 F.3d. 811 (9th Cir. 2003).)     Fair use. It was a fair use, not an infringement, to reproduce Grateful Dead concert posters within a book. Important factors: The Second Circuit focused on the fact that the posters were reduced to thumbnail size and reproduced within the context of a timeline. (Bill Graham Archives v. Dorling Kindersley Ltd., 448 F.3d 605 (2d Cir. 2006).)   Fair use. A Google search engine infringed a subscription-only website (featuring nude models) by reproducing thumbnails. Important factors: The court of appeals aligned this case with Kelly v. Arriba-Soft (above), which also permitted thumbnails under fair use principles. (Perfect 10, Inc. v. Amazon. com, Inc., 508 F. 3d 1146 (9th Cir. 2007).)  [source](http://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/cases/)

Yeah I guess I didn't make it clear but I actually have watched all of season 2-7 and for the most part it was fucking great. Just finished "All good things..." like 2 days ago which was a fairly fitting end for the TV show.
Give that corner to Klose!
Most upsets in the world cup group stage ever? I'm not losing hope, Deutschland ueber alles(ausser USA)!
But it does bring a group of similar minded people together. I am subscribed to /r/drugs but I never really post there. I will admit sometimes the posts get me cravings to do those drugs but it has not increased my overall drug use at all and is a very knowledgeable and for the most part level-headed community.
Who cares? Your'e a fucking dick
Maybe it is that simple, but I'm sure there are other factors at play. Yes 3 legs on the ground at all times is great but what about for walking over things? What about getting away from predators? Etc. Is it the most efficient for all these factors which highly influence the life and death of the insect and in turn the strength of the colony.   It obviously is because insects have 6 legs but what I'm trying to say it's not just basic geometry by any means.

For me a bad trip on acid(never had a bad one on shrooms) is kind of like taking the anxiety and uncomfortable feeling I get when I'm too high or in the wrong environment and multiplying it by 10. I've tripped probably at least 40 times, the last time over a year ago. That was such a bad trip I had to leave my friends because I was paranoid and was at the point where my mind was racing too fast to even be able to form coherent sentences. By the time I wanted to say something, my mind was already somewhere else so anything I said would have be incoherent babble.  I've also convinced myself I was crazy a couple times and that this time I had taken it too far, taken too much acid and I was never gonna come back down. Those trips sucked a lot but a good trip on acid is equally as mind blowing, in an opposite, amazing way.  TLDR: Acid is a hell of a drug
Only the juciest survive
Yeah mental illness scares the fuck out of me, I read a story here from a paramedic send to a girls house by her mother because she was having an episode again.  He walked into the house and found the girl sitting by herself in the living room. Apparently as he walked in she stared at him for about 30 seconds and that stood up completely inhuman way that he said looked like something a human could never do. She then said something along the lines of I am the devil incarnate. She then held her hand up in way it seemed like she was holding something and said to him I Hold here the key to enter the gates of hell and walked up to him. He has absolutely no belief in the supernatural and he still said it was the scariest thing that has ever happened to him and it still freaks him the fuck out to this day.
Maybe I'm a bit odd but honestly fake rape/hardcore bondage turn me on. Not too much so that its the only type of porn I watch, but I'll throw it in rotation every now and then.  No idea why I like it and it disgusts me in real life or if its real but I guess it's the whole domination/power thing. When im having sex with I'll get into dirty talk a bit like "you've been such a naughty girl" etc... Wow that sounds fucking lame typed out but I think the whole exchange is fairly normal. I may be just jaded by porn so someone please let me know if this is odd or I am fucked up freak.
A little fucking callous but you make good points.
