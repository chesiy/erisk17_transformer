So in response to the question: "What is your dream job?" Isn't the real question: "What would you do if you didn't need to worry about money?"   This isn't an idle question.  As a society we're quickly approaching a state where there just won't be enough jobs, and we'll have to figure out what to do with people.  This is a scary question, but it should be an exciting one.

Excellent.  Thanks for the link to the paints.
Yeah, I just added the "Add My Local Library Branch" link.  If you click on it, it then tries to determine your location.
Sweet!  I'll get on that :)

Thank you, Clarice.
I think I'd rather talk about who the fuck brings a six year old girl to a Dark Knight movie.  I know it's tragic, but what the hell?
Voyager I: When Engineers Were Engineers who could code an Operating System for a Freakin' Spaceship in 68 Freakin' Kilobytes! 35 years later and still accepting commands.   [Voyager I FAQ](http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/faq.html)  Question: What kind of computers are used on the Voyager spacecraft?  Answer: There are three different computer types on the Voyager spacecraft and there are two of each kind. Total number of words among the six computers is about 32K.   Computer Command System (CCS) - 18-bit word, interrupt type processors (2) with 4096 words each of plated wire, non-volatile memory.   Flight Data System (FDS) - 16-bit word machine (2) with modular memories and 8198 words each   Attitude and Articulation Control System (AACS) - 18-bit word machines (2) with 4096 words each.   According to my calulations, that's a total of about 68KB, or small potatoes compared to today's microprocessors. We probably could perform all functions with one of today's boards and still have room for solid state data storage and much more fault detection software. We would still need a second unit for redundancy. Today's microprocessors are also much faster than the chips used on Voyager and a comparative system would use less electrical power. On the other hand, software might be more complicated as opposed to that used in an interrupt type system, but it would be much more capable and more flexible.   Let's look closer at the CCS. The CCS has two main functions: to carry out instructions from the ground to operate the spacecraft, and to be alert for a problem or malfunction and respond to it. Two identical 4096- word memories contain both fixed routines (about 2800 words) and a variable section (about 1290 words) for changing science sequences. The CCS issues commands to the AACS for movement of the scan platform or spacecraft maneuvers; to the FDS for changes in instrument configurations or telemetry rates and to numerous other subsystems within the spacecraft for specific actions. Fault-protection algorithms are also stored in the CCS, occupying roughly 10 percent of the CCS memory.   The main functions of the FDS are to collect data from, and controls the operations of, the scientific instruments; and to format engineering and science data for on-board storage and/or real-time transmission. The FDS also keeps the spacecraft "time" and provides frequency references to the instruments and other spacecraft subsystems.   The Voyager spacecraft computers are interrupt driven computer, similar to processors used in general purpose computers with a few special instructions for increased efficiency. The programming is a form of assembly language.   There is no clock chip, as such, in the spacecraft. The "clock" is really a counter, based on one of several electronically generated frequencies. These frequencies, based on a reference, generated by a very stable oscillator, are converted and fed to different locations in the spacecraft as synchronization signals, timers, counters, etc. The "clock" signal is part of the information telemetered to the ground and it is with ground software that we convert to day of year, time of day Greenwich Mean Time.   Voyager was built in-house at JPL; the computers were manufactured by General Electric to JPL specifications.

k.  I'm gonna jump in here.  Years ago I was talking with a gay friend over beers, and I asked: "What is **with** you guys?  Why are [your clubs](http://www.paradisecambridge.com/) always getting shut down over wild orgies?"  He explained, "In heterosexual relationships there's usually one party who wants to do it **all the time** and another who sort of keeps things sane.  Well, you get a bunch of guys together, and you pretty much don't have that sanity element.  Everybody wants to do it."

Two things: 1. Eating fat doesn't make you fat, eating carbs does: http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/07/magazine/what-if-it-s-all-been-a-big-fat-lie.html 2. Exercise doesn't help you lose weight.  It doesn't burn enough calories, and generally makes you hungrier.  This is not to say that exercise isn't good for you, it's just that eating less is the best way to lose weight.
There's even a mighty poem about these poor lads:  http://schoonerfare.com/schoonerfare/8886.html  POWDER MONKEY Words and Music by Steve Romanoff Copyright 1985  In days of old, so the story's told, Of boys who went to sea, All of seven, eight and nine years old they say, To serve upon the warring ships, their captains and their kings, To serve the purpose they still serve today, To serve the purpose they still serve today. To carry up the powder from the magazine below, From a hold too dark and crowded for a man, The called them Powder Monkies, every schoolchild ought to know, The price we pay to keep a promised land, The price we pay to keep a promised land.  Send for the Powder Monkey, Send him down into the well, Send for the Powder Monkey, He'll fetch us a pail o' hell To keep out cannon burnin' He'll fall behind the gun, We'll just send for a Powder Monkey, 'Cause there's more where he came from.  They come from the city sidewalks and They come from the family farm, To trust their fragile futures to the wind, They come from the Land of Plenty, Through the evergreens and corn, With more to lose than all the angry men, With more to lose than all the angry men. Was it the hunger of the family, Was it the anger of the street, That drove a lonely child to Satan's door, Where death was all but certain and Damnation near complete, Save all for the holy innocent ashore, Save all the holy innocent ashore.  From high above the gun deck Ring the orders of the realm, To roll out a battle cadence on the drum, As forward into darkness Sail the cowards at the helm, And they shoot the stars to see how far they've come, Look at their sons to see how far they've come. In days of old, so the story's told Of boys who went to sea, All of seven, eight and nine years old they say, To serve upon the warring ships, their captains and their kings, To serve the purpose they still serve today, To serve the purpose they still serve today.
So last weekend I was at an art fair (ArtBeat in Davis Sq.) and saw this madman with the most astonishingly compulsive handmade Neo-Victorian Steam-Powered kinetic sculptures ...   Unfortunately I can't find any videos, or even a website, I'd just assumed that he'd have one that I could find later.  I think maybe he's too busy reinventing the past to upload stuff to youtube.  But I did find these pictures which of course do no justice to the experience of seeing them in action:  http://s579.photobucket.com/albums/ss237/Steamachine/?action=view current=DSCF2686-2.jpg http://s579.photobucket.com/albums/ss237/Steamachine/?action=view current=DSCF2730.jpg http://s579.photobucket.com/albums/ss237/Steamachine/?action=view current=DSCF0623.jpg newest=1  Oh, and it was a 90 degree day and I got to watch him tending his propane-powered steam generator!
I guess I just wish his story was less believable.  I wish my government didn't have a history of abducting people and holding them in secret prisons.  I wish it didn't have a history of fabricating evidence as a pretext for an illegal war.  Maybe he's telling the truth, maybe not; I just wish I could say to myself, "No, my government would never do something like that."
