Is it that bad that they kick you out if you grunt there? I personally find it entertaining
Gotta catch em' all!
I like how she just plays along at the end and acts like she knew the answer all along. Oh an hour fucking duh!
Yeah at first it was cute because she's kinda cute and has nice tits but then I was cringing after her friend explained it the 4th time
Yeah as others have said, it's a huge pain in the ass to reunite dog and handler like in this case. I think I watched a documentary a while back where a former EOD soldier had an IED go off near him which paralyzed him from the waist down. His dog survived and it took them about 5 years as well to get the dog back to him. He described the situation to be extremely frustrating and that it was unbelievable how many loops you have to jump through and paperwork you have to fill out to get a service dog once they 'retire'. Eventually it happened and the feels man...the feels.
Death by cake
Just like you babe
The above-linked video has been circulating since 2009 and is variously reported as an audition for the television showArmenia's Got Talent,Poland's Got Talent, orRussia's Got Talentgone horribly wrong, a haplessly comedic "William Tell" act that ends with one participant taking an arrow straight through the head. No program by any of those names exists, however, and the set shown in the video curiously features only generic signs and props reading"Talent" in English  no fuller program name is displayed, no signage bearing anything written in the language of the country in which this program supposedly aired is evident, and no one in the clip speaks a word of dialogue.  The video can be pegged as fake for a number of reasons, chief among them that if such a horrible accident had truly occurred during the recording of a television show, it would not have been broadcast, and so we'd expect to be viewing the action "raw" as captured by a single camera. Yet the clip has obviously been cleanly edited (to include cuts to the judges' reactions) and has been subject to post-production (to add graphic overlays), simulating the appearance of something that was prepared or aired as part of a finished program. (Notto mention that the bowman fails to evince the least bit of horror or surprise at having "accidentally" shot his partner in the head.)  Some have speculated that this clip was a viral promotion for theCULT Colaenergy drink, a can of which the "victim" ostentatiously takes from one of the judges and places atop his head (with the label properly facing the camera) after failing at multiple efforts to balance an apple on his noggin. However, most likely it was merely intended as a spoof of the modern talent show genre.  Source: http://www.snopes.com/photos/accident/russiantalent.asp
My wife is taking the lil guy tomorrow. Yeah our first cat was also a rescue and was 4 weeks old. She did fine and is now majestic and free :)
Yeah we're just hoping the little one makes it. His eyes arent even open yet I'm assuming  a week old..
I like Ninja and his stream on twitch. However, when it comes to being competitive and playing other pro teams he can come off abrasive to other teammates. And Ark/Aries have the same personality so I think that's why it didn't work. I knew it wouldn't last long after watching them scrim online. I think I watched them lose like 4-5 consecutive games on stream
It's not their relative level of danger that makes them scary. It's that the fucking slither around and are so stealthy. Always there, always watching. Snakes and spiders...the ultimate voyeurs.
That one Fucker doesn't even have a torso and is still trying to cop a feel!
Like Bryan Silva said...one day people will respect him for being a real ass nigga
I will paint it with your blood! And I won't even care!
Haha the sign for the yard it was located in has a website: autobeyours.com  The sign also said "hybrid cars and parts". Fuck they weren't lying.
Haha exactly what I was thinking. Saul Goodman to the rescue!    But seriously can't wait for the new show...apparently getting good reviews so far...
But I dont want any treble!

No idea how the threat got all the way out the door. With that many cops the threat should have been eliminated immediately. Getting in a firefight in a doorway is bad news. They got the job done though and kudos for no one else being killed (hostages).
It is corny lmao but I'm dranking sry I'm not sry
This is relevant but me and my wife saw "Into the Woods" last night. I was blown away by the sexual undertones and general themes for a 'kids movie'. There's a scene in the woods with Emily Blunt and Chris Pine where they hardcore makeout (when Blunts married with a newborn child) and carry on for 5 minutes with song about how it doesn't matter what happens since they're in the woods.   There was death and disfigurement throughout as well. Maybe its just me but it did seem a bit much for a children's movie. Just my two cents.
What the fuck?

The open the capsule and it's a nude portrait of Paul Revere. Well played sir..
I wonder how painful it would be to get that filled in with ink. Think about the stories you could tell... "Cool tat bro where'd you get that idea?..  "Oh that's where I got struck by lightning back in '99" ...__
Your girlfriend pulled a fast one on ya with the most elaborate setup yet. She "faked" sick   clued in one of her friends to your little game. She even planned it to the extent of when it would be storming and also pretended to be asleep. All the while snickering behind the door while you look for her and talk to yourself.
Slice of Life
he looks weird. Like he has a spray tan and tons of botox. Seriously get a group of guy friends and confront him like you gotta a fucking problem?! And go from there. If he still keeps up I'd take it to the cops or take matters into my own hands. My two cents.
What the actual fuck...looks like some real life Hills Have Eyes cousin-fucker bullshit. And donating dog food for admission? Da fuq
Fuck that. I can take ghost stories any day but anything with the occult/pentagrams/Satan scares the shit out of me. Id have to be heavily intoxicated/armed to go in that bitch.
Sleep Paralysis   the like.   So a couple nights ago I experienced what I think was sleep paralysis for the first time in my life (I'm 26). It was the most terrifying yet interesting experience I've had in my entire life. Basically, I went to sleep that night and woke up in the middle but I was paralyzed. I had an overwhelming fear take over my whole body as if someone or something was in the room with me. I read up on it and basically my mind was awake but my body was still "asleep". It gives me the chills thinking back on it. It lasted maybe ten seconds then I was woke up woke up and was able to move and function normally. Anyone else experienced this? Idk what could have triggered it as I have no family history of this and as I said I've never experienced it in 26 years. So random to happen now.
