Soooo......... Do we get another update? At least one explaining why you're immune to the mold and to Hadwell?
This is the only one that gives me pause. The use of the radio. Only because in GoF, Hermione explains that there is too much magic around Hogwarts, and it would interfere with any sort of electronics. I'm pretty sure that the cameras they are using are older models that don't have any electronic parts. As to why they haven't incorporated any other Muggle tech into their world is because their homes would be too infused with magic (as similar to Hogwarts) and they would fry the electronics. The Hogwarts Express is a steam engine, one of the first trains invented, and therefore has no electronics.   Hope this helps!!
They could've used the spell that either Crouch or Amos used in the beginning of the book as well. It would've shown them the last few spells Harry used, and then they would've seen that he didn't kill Cedric.   Honestly, I think that even the Ministry couldn't find a way to justify Harry being the killer. They knew that if they did that, the rest of the Wizarding World would've known Harry was telling the truth, because he's the Boy Who Lived.
I would actually suggest rock salt versus sea salt. Much more pure, much stronger at keeping evil at bay.
Hope you and Holly are still safe.... I know we are all worried about you.
Yeah. He was always really creeped out by them. We found like this dead animal down there back when we were kids, and he swore up and down it was a human body and made us leave. Thats why he would never go with me again. Thats.comforting. Wow. Relax. It was just a dog or something that fell in and got stuck. I felt bad for it but it definitely wasnt a dead person.  Guys, Caleb knew what this was.... This is why he freaked out so much. He knew way more than he initially let on.   Caleb, if you're reading this, sorry to call you out like that.
Guys, all I have to say right now is be careful. I know the new moon is coming on soon, and I don't want you guys to end up hurt or dead.   Also, Holly, be careful the next time you meet up with Lucifer. He seems somewhat trustworthy from what I've read so far, and all the lore I've ever read about him seems to state that he doesn't lie all that much. He does on occasion, and I do know that most true Demons don't lie. They may leave some stuff out of their deals with humans, but they don't lie. Angels lie. A lot. Just tread with caution.
Isaiah, when can we get an update from your time gone? I know I'm curious as to what happened to you for sure.
How long ago was this?
.....and now my eyes are dry....
Will second this statement...... What the actual fuck did I just read?
Soooo..... It sounds like you should move. Like now. Maybe move in with Anna somewhere new? That seems to be the only thing that would help. Unless they follow you.... As for any new owners to the house, well they can deal with the Ghosts or Demons, or whatever they are. Just be sure you're careful when moving.
.....did you castrate him at the time?
I just went to my GP
.......The fuck?
I just want to know, why did the turtle have to die?
I'm sorry for your loss. What was your father like?
So I'm curious, and a little lost, OP. What does cracking your knuckles do?
First, I want to thank everyone here for your support :) you're a great group of people, and I'm glad I have this sub.   Second, this isn't a work related injury. It's just pain brought on by my arthritis. I appreciate everyone's concern, but this isn't the first time this has happened. I'll get through it, I was just hoping someone would have some advice on pain management :/
THE BUTTON!!!!!   Yeah, I pressed it. Couldn't stop myself. AMA!!
Simmons. The chick that plays her is fine, and the accent, oh god the accent......
......Can someone please tell me what video this is? I've actually never heard of it.....
I never really thought of Charlie in that sense. In fact, I never really think of any of the characters in that sense unless it's a situation like when Sam or Dean has a female guest over. Other than that, to me, they are all just people who hunt the things that go bump in the night. So I guess I'm saying that I personally have never had a problem with Charlie, however, I can definitely see where you would have a problem with her. And kudos to you for pointing this out :)
Welcome home, friend!!
I like this idea. This one seems like the most likely to me.
I'm willing to bet JKR realised that her faithful fandom would bring this point up, though. Hence the reason that Harry became a horcrux.
Bacon, coffee, clean hair, and beer
You and I not only have something in common, then, but would also be excellent friends.
Ah yes. Some of those plot lines were missing. However, I still believe it was the best. The final movie haas too many disappointments for me.
Why is r/Hogwarts private?
Question for the fellow Potterheads of the world.   In the audiobooks, it's pronounced Voldemore. In the paper books and movies, it's Voldemort. Someone help?
So I don't know how to post how long it's been for me, but it's been over a year now. The e cigarette is a joke. I tried one for a while, and I fucking hated it. What you want to do is go to the nearest vape shop. Look it up, google can tell you where it is. Go in and tell them your story. They will help you out. I have a regular shop I go to, and they are some of the nicest, most supportive people I've met (besides my girlfriend of course.)   Keep it up!! You can do it!!
