Just finished "Never Let Me Go". It broke me.   Very few books, if any, have ever made me feel quite like this. Definitely more rare, is that I have to take a while to digest a book. I don't think I'll be able to forget about this one for a while. One of the most heart-breakingly true and human books ever written.
Someone else as in, from a different origin?   I don't mind that they're doing something different with him. And I don't blame them for taking steps to differentiate between the last incarnation so recently after it. I just think they're more worried than they need to be. Comparisons are bound to be made, but, honestly, the films won't even be slightly similar.
Holy shit, I'm about to go to bed so I was like "yeah, I'll listen to this song quickly."  It's not the Streetlight Manifesto version, and it's not as good. Oh god, its quite terrible actually. Listening to the proper one now, drop the link here methinks.   [Ah, that's better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfAdFKJfHZ4)
Ooh, *out there*, hey? Do tell. =D

Youtube channel art (?)   New to the sub so not sure if this is within the rules, or what normally happens, but...can I request an entirely new cover art? I don't have anything to build it on, so it would have to be from scratch. You would of course be credited.  The channel is called: British Book Guy  Im British and it's a booktube channel. :)  Really it only needs to be simple, just the name in front of something british like the Union Jack or St. Georges Cross, with a cup of tea or something. Like I said, full creative control.  The recommended size is: 2560 x 1440  Apologies if this is unorthodox. And thanks either way :)
Good point, well made. I think it stands though. It's an oversight, a fairly large one.
I got that on Dayz. Tried to be nice. No luck. I even tricked a guy into thinking I was a friend - he had ammo I needed. I got close and killed him. There was a guy running on a desolate road, coming towards me. We stopped, stared at each other, neither making a move. He turned his back on me - judging me as not a threat - and I took him out from behind. Shit does that to you. Gotta survive. And then, when I had a really good character. Good weapons, plenty of ammo and food, someone took a lucky pot shot at me with a sniper rifle - never even saw them or the gun. Just *boom* black screen. Buh-bai good character. I later found my corpse. Picked clean.
Thankyou, sir. I will try this out shortly. (Not that I can play yet but it's always fun =] )
Generally the aim of a thing. If things are generally seen as high culture - such as books. That's so. However something done solely for the pursuit of money regardless of any art...  Maybe that doesn't declassify from high culture. Maybe it does.   Same for anything. Film sequels made for bullshit money. Films are high culture, but are also art.   I don't care who likes what. I don't have anything against twilight, or erotic fiction in general. If something is done for a purpose, great. If something is done for money, then it ought not be culture at all.  Yes, I've opened myself up to a lot of backlash. I know that's a flawed argument. I would rather support a low end-indie film like 'Ink' than a blockbuster film made-for-money like 50SOG.
I saw gameplay. I've seen the core function of the game. And that in itself looks awesome. I'm certainly skeptical because the inherent flaws are immediate, but I'm willing to give them a chance and see what they've done to sort them out. I don't trust expo demonstrations, I really don't. So I'm going to keep my eye out and see what happens, and how it expands, and, most importantly, on what they have to say about the gameplay.  Otherwise, it looks awesome.
I'd say you could possibly come back to DA after The Witcher 3, but I just think it would be so flawed after playing TW3 - an unadulterated masterpiece.  I'm sorry to have put you off DA. It started well, but didn't hold it. I wanted to like it but couldn't, so I know what it's like to have to drop a game. Let's just say - if you do drop it - I'm saving you a few hours that will only end in heartbreak.
A little undeveloped at the moment. Need to work on it, make it more watchable, try and evaluate if it would actually work. See if my friend - who I have ran the idea past - is as interested as they seem, or if they were just humouring me...
Took the place of favouritest ever novel alongside two or three others. It's not as elite a group as I'd like haha.  Gaiman is my favourite author. He is a god.
I agree with all of that. But for the actual creative part, the fun part of coming up with new things, and not knowing exactly where my characters will go, or how I'll write it, what I'll come up with, I love that. That's just the appreciation of literature. But, of course, it is all terrible without editing.  I edited my own novel for a year. That included removing 18k words and reading it over more than ten times. Three times out loud in its entirety. That sure as hell put me off editing.
The Humans, by Matt Haig   I'm actually quite nearly finished this. Overall it has been a very easy read. A decent book complimented by it's fairly short length. If it was any longer, I don't think I would enjoy it as much. It is compact, and that really works in its benefit. It isn't as heavy a book as I thought it would be, or maybe as the author intended it to be, but it has its moments. I've laughed, and some of the one-liners about humanity have hit me. I would recommend.
