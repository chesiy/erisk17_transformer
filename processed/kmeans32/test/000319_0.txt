Jayski posts the old non chase points each week. After last week he actually would have been up to 10th. So possibly even higher after his 6th place finish today.
Carpet?
Would there be any advantage to changing up the type of interval running I do?   I've been running for several years and around last October I initially began increasing my speed for short periods during one run a week.  This turned into a sort of interval run for me where I alternate between 1/2 mile at slow pace and 1/4 mile at the sprinting pace and then the final sprint I push myself for .4 miles.  Over time I've been increasing the speeds, and I can definitely tell it's helping.  My natural pace went from about 7.1 mph to 8.0 over the past 6 months.    Recently I started wondering if trying out a different system of interval running would be beneficial, or if it would essentially be as effective as what I'm currently doing.  I was thinking of possibly a pyramid interval in order to try to get longer distances in during my sprinting portions.  I don't really have a specific goal that I'm working to attain.  Aside from natural buildup for better speed and endurance.  Just wondering if there would be any benefit by changing things up a little bit.

Yup, that's what I would say he is thinking of too.
My brother bought one about 3 years ago at a garage sale. It's fun because you have to think back circa 1995 for what the answers actually are.
YOUR DRIVERS ALL SUCK.  ALL HAIL OUR OVERLORD JIMMIE JOHNSON!
And it takes a long time to count that high.  Just counting to [1 million](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Harper) can take 3 months.

No worries.  I know you're just doing what you can on here.
Drivers giving 100%   So during the race today my brother thought of something in regards to NASCAR's new rule that drivers give 100% effort all the time.  With the restrictor plate race some drivers say that their plan is to stay in the back until the end of the race.  By doing this aren't they actually giving less than 100% effort to try to win the race?  So shouldn't that driver get a penalty for doing this?  Just curious what your thoughts are about this.
I agree.  In past seasons when he did hang out in the back it seemed like it almost never worked out for Jimmie.  This year he's actually been running in the front of the pack and it shows with the results since you're less likely to be caught up in a big one if you're in the front.
Hi Chad, you're doing a great job with the team!  I'm looking forward to you winning that 6th championship this year!  In regards to the 48 team haters referring to you as a cheater.  Do you despise them calling you that, or does it make you stronger inside and want to win more just to show them who's boss?
While I see your point, there's also a reson for buying a vowel in the case of the word "the".  If there are a lot of other letters missing on the board and you're not really sure of what to guess, then buying an "E" is a way to keep your turn along with seeing if there are other "E's" on the board to help on your next spin.
I'm sure I can't be the only one who has done this.
I went with 2 of my brothers last year and we got there around 3pm.  It would have been sooner, but my brothers aren't too motivated to get up in the morning and our hotel was in downtown Charlotte.  We didn't have any trouble with parking.  It was about half a mile south of the track in a free lot.  I would recommend getting there sooner though if you feel like walking around and being able to check out a good amount of the stuff there.
I would have to say the [T-Rex](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkEVKzZNQDY) is the best demo on the original Playstation.
You have an initial budget of $100 and need to buy 5 drivers.  You can either try to buy 5 guys in the middle of the pack to have an overall good group.  Or you can spend the big bucks and get a top driver or two, but then sacrafice it by having to pick at least one lower level crappy driver to be able to afford all of them.  If your driver's value goes up, then you can sell them at a higher level than you bought them at and your entire salary cap increases.  For example: You buy someone that costs $20 and after 3 weeks they now are worth $21.  If you sell them, then your total salary cap will go up by $1.  But the same is true for drivers who go down in value.  You can sell them at a loss and take a hit, or you can try to ride them out and hope their value goes back up.

It's been a while since I've played this, but I thought it was off by one.  So to get the star, you'd actually press the button when the mushroom before the star was in the center of the screen.  and all three rows worked the same way.

Why would you stop in the first place if it's only going to make you mad that you have to wait on a person crossing the road?  And it was your own choice.
Since a little over 10 years have passed already , you actually only have just a hair over 12 years left to wait.  That time will fly by!
Makes me think of Wrestlemania 2000 on the N64. The game came out in 1999, but it lets you input dates for when you win a belt back to something like 1955.
TIL that Spanish cemeteries lease their burial plots as opposed to selling them
I can't stand it when people do that either, even when they aren't my games.  I'm glad I trained my younger brothers years ago that games need to be put back in cases and regardless how mad you get, you shouldn't throw a controller on the ground.  Or else you may face a week of not being able to play.  Now a days the game collection is in great shape and everything still works like new!
That is 2 1/2 minutes of my life gone.  But I'd say it was worth it.
Don't forget to wash your hands!  You wouldn't want those shit particles accidentally being posted onto reddit!
