"As if we need any more reasons for the [REAL God](http://orig00.deviantart.net/9bdf/f/2007/284/6/6/quetzalcoatl_by_genzoman.jpg) to hate this team"
Yeah.
Yeah, I would have a show like Oprah.  I would be the host of, everyday Christmas Give Dusty a wish list.  I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt.  And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had shit.   Give away a few Mercedes like, "Here, lady, have this".  And last but not least grant somebody their last wish.  It's been a couple months since I've single so.  You can call me Travie Claus, minus the "Ho Ho".   Get it, I'd probably visit where Katrina hit.  And damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did.  Yeah, can't forget about me, stupid.  Everywhere I go I'mma have my own theme music.   I'll be playing basketball with the President Dunking on his delegates.  Then I'll compliment him on his political etiquette.  Toss a couple milli in the air just for the heck of it.  But keep the fives, twenties, tens and bens completely separate.  And yeah I'll be in a whole new tax bracket We in recession but let me take a crack at it.  I'll probably take whatever is left and just split it up.  So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks.  And not a single tummy around me would know what hungry was.  Eating good, sleeping soundly.  I know we all have a similar dream.  Go in your pocket pull out your wallet and put it in the air and sing.
Have they given designations to the new colors? We used to be Seal Brown, Pumpkin, and White. I know we have a pantone number for the orange that was referenced in an earlier thread, but do we know if they plan on naming them?
Thank you for doing the thing.  It sets us apart from the other subs, for sure.
I don't know if you're correct, but I like it.
I REALLY want to do this.  1: We Bark Together  2: Seattle  3: I cannot do international. I am a minister and my personal funds are way limited.  4: I am a vet of reddit secret santa, but I have not done Drafts for the Draft.  5: After getting really drawn into the craziness of the new Browns energy, I had to find a bigger community. Being a displaced Clevelander is hard. 10 years in ATL, and now I live (hopefully forever) outside of Seattle in the mountains. I am wearing a Browns shirt and orange shorts in San Fran in China Town as we speak.
Unlike the reality of Squatching, this picture is a joke. Jokes are made to help people feel light hearted about serious subjects. I'm sorry that many if you are too beat up by the scientific community to find this funny. **posted by a guy who really believes in Bigfoot, and also thinks this post is funny**
Yis. This
[JERSEY QUESTION] I am about to buy the last of my Pre-2015 Jerseys and I'd like your help.   I am going to get one more jersey before we change to the new style. I already have a Seal Brown '40' that was given to me with "Hillis" scraped off and my name stenciled on as a gift (First Jersey) I then bought a Seal Brown Cribbs '16' and a Seal Brown Haden '23'. I pretty much know that I want a Thomas '73'. The question is, do I want to go Seal Brown again, or do I go with my first White Jersey?   I want the Seal Brown because I worry we wont have them next year, and I think I will still be able to get a white jersey next year. But I dont have a white jersey, yet, and I think Thomas might be really sick in White.   Suggestions?
Wokka wokka!
Your tears make me happy.
Gratzi.
Yeah,  and Manziel has run his crooked little pecker down the mouth of a /u/740Buckeye and the rest of the sub has to smell the cum breath he left you,  because you insist on wagging your cum soaked tongue all over this sub.
Part of a series where we "invoke" deities. This year I had to do Cross Gendered. This is me as "Fortuna"
Yeah, splitting the energy of the fanbase isnt my favorite idea. I would rather have the conversations here. I'm all in on Hoyer, and I wouldnt want to spend all my time with people who just wanted to talk about him. *This in no way is an endorsement for either QB. We Bark Together*
I was really happy to see this happen when it did. 5 ints and no tds over two games is the right time to put someone on the bench and make them  watch their replacement. He did better than I thought in certain cases, and worse than I thought he would be in others. Good stuff from him though, and I'm glad he got his start. I do not, however, think they will keep him in next week. Just a hunch. We'll see.
But you did say this:   Ahh, the victim complex. Classic!  Which is the same as   you're too much of a homer to see it.  in that we dont need to trash each other on this sub. We're supposed to be the best fans in the NFL. Let's do that. We dont need to blitz each other when there is so many boobs, beers, and dogs with hats to make us the envy of /r/nfl. It's all irie.
Johnny Manziel might not be a trouble maker, but trouble sure finds him. Cant wait till he's the starter and is still doing BS like this. This junk makes him look like a thuggish child. Who let's their crew beat the shit out of folks? Plaxico. Next thing he'll be shooting himself in the leg and wearing sweat pants to night clubs.
Let's do this one for the Gipper!   Browns.
Also that /u/rsipp512 would rather hear about all the topics we cover day in and day out, than to hear anything new or an opinion that might be from a fans personal media. Unless it's his perspective, and his media, I'm sure. Himz an enforcer. So I am complying and posting the same thing. Just like everyone else all over the web. Hoyer v Manziel conjecture. 24/7
I dont know about your downvotes. I do know that it's equally important to consider WHEN you say something, as WHY you say something. That being said, McCoy  Weeden. You are correct. Upvote for you.
Okay, First off I will disappoint everyone, but hopefully I will make up for it with the story. I didn't get pictures. I was so busy this weekend that I got 10 hours of sleep from Thursday to Sunday, and 5 of them came from Saturday to Sunday. I have [this picture](http://imgur.com/8GIvVbZ) that I took. It shows the concept, but I tried to upload it before the event, and my phone wouldn't let me. My menu was really simple. I'll tell you the entire production for the final nights feast.   We had what I named Harvest Feast Pork (not very original, but it went with the theme)  I took my trimmed, 2-3 inch cubed pieces of pork leg, and braised them with salt an pepper. Then I added used olive oil, and garlic instead of onion in my mirapoix (so celery, carrot, and garlic). To deglaze I used white wine (chardonnay) and apple juice. I then added a rosemary/parsley bouquet garni. I put it in at 350 for 4 hours. When the meat came out, I used corn starch as a thickener.  Earlier in the day, my morning crew had peeled, cored, and sliced into quarters, 5 bags of apples and pears. I then panned them, covered them in cinnamon, and made a slurry of apple juice, water, cinnamon, and sugar. I poured that over the top and set to cook it for 2 1/2 hours at 350. I also learned how to use convection ovens this weekend (that was cool) and I made near to 90 squash that we served in quarters. I had also made a "Hobbit Stew" earlier and put up in the freezer for the feast. It was a homemade Veggie stock (carrots, celery, leek, garlic, ginger, rosemary, thyme, parsley) and then I used it as the base for turnips, parsnips, rutabagas, yellow/purple/red potatoes, sweet potatoes, purple yams, and Asian yams which I served a ladle of to everyone. Then corn on the cob cooked in water with a little sugar and apple juice, as well as pretzel rolls were the sides. It was an amazing feast. We had pumpkin pie (store bought) to accompany everything and southern style sweet tea to beat the band.   We had 2 other dinners that were made in the same exact way except they were beef, and the bouquet garni was rosemary, and then thyme on the second one.  It was wonderful and I could never have done it without you. I will scour the pictures coming out from the event and see if anyone took pictures of their food. Since that is all instagram seems to be used for, I am hoping it is inevitable that I can find some. Thank you again and I am a life long follower of /r/cooking from here on out!
You did exactly that, earlier. You crossed your arms, stuck out your tonge, and told me I had "unmitigated hubris". I'm not talking to the mods, I am talking to the person who doesnt know me who told me to take it to /r/nativeamericanspiritualists when they arent even PAGAN! I'm not gonna drop my d ^k on the table and tell you my lineage or my degrees, but I has 'em, Jack. I'm wondering why you are here? Why are you preying on /r/pagans? Do you have a lot of friends here? You get a lot of upvotes for telling pagans they should shoot, or run over Coyotes that they see?
I just think thats the classiest thing! "You know, we have a storied history with, and have always stood up for murderers and spousal abusers. In that spirit we would like to dedicate this game to Ray Rice" Even if you support Ray, THAT is not the way to do it. THAT is tactless, imo.
I got downvoted hard for this over at r/Ravens, but you hate being right all the time. (Link in Text)   I [told the Ravens sub](http://www.reddit.com/r/ravens/comments/26mas5/ravens_4th_round_draft_pick_rb_lorenzo_taliaferro/chsepzu) when their people started getting in trouble (specifically this was about Lorenzo Taliaferro) that it was Karma. I even wrote a story, and was downvoted and told I was a stupid Browns Fan, and then I was accused of "Running to my sub for upvotes" (which I was too new to know that was a thing). I am reposting my story here, again, in light of Ray Rice, and the Raven fan-base can Dawg my Bone if they dont like it. The truth stings:  **My Story of The Ravens, Art Model, and the Devil**:*The Ravens were created after Baltimore made a deal with the Devil. So many angry prayers smoldered through the earth into the bowels of the Devils play place. Day and night he was assaulted with the lamentations of the lost souls, pining for their Colts. Finally the Son of Light heard a call that would end his suffering: Art Modell was weak, and was begging for release. So Lucifer, that wily old devil, whispered into the ears of each of the most powerful people in Baltimore and within the Browns, and a deal was struck! That deal included 2 SB, and safety from any lasting harm that may come against any of his players and original staff that took part in the move. In return the Browns would move to Baltimore, and in a seperate trade for his immortal soul Belichick obtained his own deal, but that will be a story for another day. And so it was that a faithful and historic football city the likes of Cleveland was stripped of their team, and Baltimores prayers were answered. But oldschool fans know in their hearts which side answered their prayers that day. It is within each true original Baltimore Colts fan. That seed. That knowledge that it was not a godsend. It came from the other direction. And they know when he came to collect. The Super Bowl in the Super Dome. That light failure was no fluke. That was the Prince of Darkness showing up to watch the final moments of his deal. You won. And so did he. And now that Devils deal Baltimore made has come around to the other side, as all deals eventually do. I have a feeling that you will be seeing much more of this as the balance exherts itself. Safe travels, friends.* *edit:formatting*
I think that after seeing another "Indians go 6-3 probably higher than most Browns scores by halftime" posts on twitter I just snapped a little this morning, and it was early. I have since learned who he is. /r/Browns is the place to learn whatever you dont know about the organization. He seriously just has never really come across my feeds. I'll have to search him out actively for a bit and check him out
"Conner Shaw-nuff you right he had a 151 passer rating" I'm still working on it.
I agree with you. I also have been a big fan of him as a pickup since the Draft. My prediction was that Hoyer would get bumped out for Manzeil, then around game 8 I see him getting creamed on a scramble, and then they bring in Shaw and he lights it up not only that game, but for the rest of the,  year. He starts in Johnny comes back at the beginning of '15, plays 2 games, they bring Shaw back, he takes us to the Super Bowl.
I was going off of the news report that I read earlier about them telling him that CLE is a working town. It reminded me that few people get anything handed to them in NE Ohio. We make people who become presidents and astronauts because we know that hard work and dedication breed success. We want Johnny to be a success.  *edit: its not about "Making him pay for it". That was really thrown around by the media.  Its about learning. I understand lineage. Manzeil isn't just sitting on the sidelines, he's learning from Hoyer, who learned from Brady, who learned from Belichick. This is putting Johnny into that lineage and is part of what has the chance to take him from "Possible Great" to "Amazing"*
A wonderful poem about the Mother.
The Aquarian Tabernacle Church and Pete Pathfinder Davis have done, as far as I can tell by looking at history, far more with far less scandal than the Frosts. Veterans Tombstone Pentacle, only .edu sponsored pagan seminary, umbrella 501 (c) 3 which just by the ATC having it, it gives all of Wicca privileges that other pagan religions don't enjoy in the eyes of the government, prisoner rights for incarcerated pagans, and a myriad other accomplishments from the making it safe to be open in the Mid-South, to defending churches from all denominations (Pagan to Christian and back again) from unfair laws levied against home worship. I think few people throw Pete's name around in the circles of Pagans changing the world, because his ministry has always been behind a desk and not in front of a camera. The video of him posted earlier in the month was the first video of him I have ever seen, though I have enjoyed the benefits of his accomplishments every day I have been a Pagan. Which is every year of my life since I was 5. I think that Pete has always been an administrative Pagan. Raymond Buckland called him one of the most influential Pagans in history. His life before Paganism was one of political service. He was the mayor of Hanover, NJ. No democrat had been elected as mayor in that town for over 100 years, until he ran. He kept the job until he decided not to run again. Wicca may not seem political, but as Wiccans we are charged with keeping the balance. The People in here may or may not be correct about there being/not being a conspiracy concerning Christians and the government, but we are woefully short of Pagan politicians on either side of the isle. That's an imbalance. Pete has always told me (because I've been lucky enough to know the man) that you get more done in a tweed jacket and leather elbow patches than you can get done in a cape. He means that we need to get out there into the real world and make our lives and beliefs a parallel to the places we live in. Its no longer shocking that were Pagan. Now that we can get past meeting someone workout them freaking out about our beliefs, some of us are ready to have a say at the school board, or in city council, or on higher levels of government.
