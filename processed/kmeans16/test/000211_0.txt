Israel has repeatedly stated that they hold Hamas, as the purported governing body of Gaza, responsible for all attacks that originate from the territory. As you can see from the year after the war (September through May, at least) you can see that Hamas can indeed control when rockets are being fired or not, even if they are not directly participating.  The point is that there was an effective 19-month ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, which Israel broke, leading to a war in which 67 Israelis died.  Unless of course you hold the easily defensible position that the kidnapping of the three teens by Hamas operatives was in itself an attack by Hamas, thus breaking the ceasefire themselves.  Or the previous opinion, that since Hamas controls the Gaza Strip, every rocket fired is in itself a violation of the ceasefire, whether Hamas does it themselves or not.   [Especially when the text of the ceasefire in 2012 states plainly that rockets attacks from **all Palestinian factions**, will cease.](http://www.jpost.com/Defense/Text-of-Israel-Hamas-cease-fire-agreement)

Hey, if no one sees it what's the point of me making it?
So, the reason it's ok for the Kohanim to get special treatment is because it's d'oraissa?   Yes, and personally I feel better about it because of the explicit balancing laid out.    If there was a source d'oraissa that said women were not obligated to pray three times a day, would you drop the egalitarianism?  1. In this argument I'm advocating, at minimal, equality without egalitarianism. Do you have response to that?  2. I'm pretty sure there isnt; I recall a sugya that states the time-based positive mitzvah rule is a guideline at best. And even if there is, why does that stop a woman from taking on the obligation and then leading? Or leading in the non time bound services?   This also doesn't address the argument of women holding women only minyanim, women being excluded from communal leadership positions, etc.
Best list I've found yet! I linked you in [my topic here](http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/343ym0/paid_mods_are_coming_whether_we_like_it_or_not/), since I'm doing something complementary to you. Maybe you should make your own topic again?  A couple more points: The actual mods given were mostly shitty (see /u/lolzergrush above) and the secrecy surrounding it runs counter to the modding community.
You're missing the fact that Palestinians in the West Bank in Gaza aren't robots controlled by outside forces, nor are they slaves to their baser natures. In addition, the rise of Hamas is much, much more complicated than that. in short, they were not forced into anything but rebelled against the PLO when Arafat "renounced" violence at the Oslo Accords. Even now, if there were non-violent protests in the West Bank, as well as other demonstrations that show the Palestinian people are ready for peace, the Israeli electorate would vote in a left wing government to negotiate it.
This is because Judaism/Jews predate the modern separation between religion and ethnicity. The best way to think about Judaism is that it is a set of laws for a tribe, the Jewish people. The tribe got dispersed and carried their rules with them. You are part of the tribe if you were born into it by its rules, or you gain nationality by becoming a citizen - in modern times, convert.  Does that make sense?   Now for your other points:      They still are Jewish. Someone can be Jewish, no practicing, or even having rejected the religion and their family lineage is not traced back to eastern Europe, or it's a weak connection which normally wouldn't be used to identify race. It doesn't make sense.   First, Jews trace lineage back to the expulsion from Israel, not to eastern Europe. Only a subset of Jews, Ashkenazim, are from Eastern Europe.  Second, the connection isn't so much used to identify race as your national/tribal affiliation. Think of it like this: Once you gain American citizenship, all your children are American citizens no matter where they are born. All their children, your grandchildren, are American even if they never enter America. Now just have the extra step that it must be your mother, not any American, and you've got a rough equivalency.  I just don't get how if I marry a jewish girl who's father is a north African Jew, mother is christian Caucasian. We get married and ignore all religion. Our kids would be Jewish?  See the nationality explanation above. The only difference is that for your kids to be American you have to register their birth an the embassy, but for Judaism is automatic. (Minor point: She would not be Jewish by traditional Jewish laws, so many Jews would not think she was Jewish and therefore her children would not be either.)  What is your thoughts on people saying something negative towards Israel as, 'Those Israeli...?'  It's as good (bad) as any other prejudice is. The problem is that many people say this to cover up anti-Semitism, and you only have to prod an inch for it to come out. It makes Jews assume that its not said with good intentions.
Alright, I'll open up the case tomorrow and poke around.   Another noob question, if you don't mind: I'm finding lots of differently priced options for video cards. For example, the Radeon R9 280: [This](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00J7YFUPA/?tag=pcpapi-20) vs. [this](http://www.amazon.com/Sapphire-Radeon-PCI-Express-Graphics-11230-00-20G/dp/B00IZXOW80/? tag=bom-tomshardware-20). Are there significant differences, or should I just get the cheapest?
Hebrew was a dead language for many centuries, spoken only by  clergy  Not true, it was used by everyone for prayer and study, and was also used as a base for derivative languages. It was never dead, unlike Latin. And since it has recently been revived with mostly the same base, it's pretty easy to get a correct translation. I can go over the verse in depth if you want.  As for cheeseburgers: that's your interpretation, don't cook the two together.  No, that is not my interpretation. That is the interpretation of the mishna, which is the recording of rabbi's statements from 100 BCE to 100 CE. This is the only interpretation Judaism has had for at least 2000 years, more if the Pharisitic claims about the Oral Law are accurate, as Orthodoxy holds.  There are other interpretations of what "unclean" means with regards to pork.  Nope, it's pretty concrete. It says don't eat it.  It's all interpretation  But there are rules and bases for the interpretation.   and these differences are relatively minor in practice compared to other religious differences.  Not true. There are significant practical issues in eating in a non-kosher home, for example. In fact, there are many more practical issues with different interpretations than many Christian sect splits.
Jesus was, after all, an unlearned Jew  Wait, I thought it was claimed he was a rabbi?  I don't find the argument that they're pulling things out of context to pull the wool over those unfamiliar with the prophecies convincing.  I wouldn't find it convincing either, except for the preponderance of evidence. I don't see any other way there are so many seemingly deliberate mistakes.  looking at the context of those verses and finding it ambiguous whether or not it is referring to the messiah.   Do you want to discuss one or more you find particularly strong or noteworthy? It's why I made the rebuttal in the first place.
Obviously, I don't have much to offer you that other people here can't top. (Maybe a steam game? I dunno.) But if you want eternal friendship, all the internet hugs, or just someone to chat with, I'm your guy. :) I'll also smash with you whenever you want! I've been playing smash since the N64 days, and though I was never I super competitive player I always loved playing, whether I got my ass kicked or not.  A PM with a code would be eternally appreciated, but if not, you have a blast playing it early!
I hope that it remains a good place for now, but a shift of evangelical opinion combined with demagogues using populist attacks against "Jewish banksters" -- well, let's just say that things could turn around very quickly.
Your argument would hold water if you were talking about not developing it in the first place because of the cost. You're saying this:  yes that's the problem...what people "~~see~~ want" and the reality it's used for are quite often different.  We can see what Iron Dome is doing *right now.*  look at the patriot act - after 9/11 every single person was gung ho for it because it seemed like it's protectingus.  now? it's the most unpatriotic thing and a tool for all of the recent NSA abuses.  And people warned about that when it was passed. This is a weapons system, not a law or planned war. Your analogies are awful.
No it isn't - you don't get a free pass to kill as many human shields as you like. Proportionality still supplies. You can't kill a hundred civilians to destroy one rocket being hidden in the same building, for example.  True. Most people mistake a war's proportionality for a strike's proportionality though. I have yet to hear of one airstrike killing one hundred civilians.  Isn't that just a tu quoque?  No, since this is said to people calling for Israel to stop bombing. Why should Israel be held to a standard that no other western country is?
