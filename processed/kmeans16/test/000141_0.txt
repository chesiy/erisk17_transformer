Solar power has come a long way from powering calculators to small electronics and now our homes, businesses and possibly the country. Currently roof top solar panels are dominating the solar industry and have become its flag carrier.
Previous techniques to align the nanotubes resulted in less-than-desirable packing density, or how close the nanotubes are to one another when they are assembled in a film. However, the University of Wisconsin-Madison materials engineers pioneered a new technique, called floating evaporative self-assembly, or FESA, which they described earlier in 2014 in the ACS journal Langmuir. In that technique, researchers exploited a self-assembly phenomenon triggered by rapidly evaporating a carbon nanotube solution.
The Remix Ultra tablet is the brainchild of three ex-Googlers, and at first impression, seems to follow the timeless tech-product-ripoff formula to perfection.
Competitors are already starting to take notice  earlier this week the French space agency, CNES, announced plans to develop its own reusable rocket tech. And in the long term, the ability to land a rocket on solid ground will assist in Musk's ultimate goal: colonising Mars.
Lost in Shangri-La though is a non-fiction accounting of a plane crash that occurred in the last days of WWII with all of the elements of a fiction adventure thriller and author Mitchell Zuckoff has the spirited talent to paint the vivid scenes needed to seize your attention and not let go.
In order to develop future quantum computer networks, it is necessary to hold a known number of atoms and read them without them disappearing. To do this, researchers from the Niels Bohr Institute have developed a method with a trap that captures the atoms along an ultra thin glass fiber, where the atoms can be controlled. The results are published in the scientific journal, Physical Review Letters.
The 25-year-old skipper is in exclusive company. He is the fifth Australian batsman to make centuries in four or more consecutive Tests, after Don Bradman, Neil Harvey, Jack Fingleton and Matthew Hayden. Smith also joins Bradman and Jacques Kallis as the only players to score four consecutive hundreds in the same series.
Automated translation is the translation of text by a computer, with no human involvement. Pioneered in the 1950s, automated translation is also referred to as machine translation, automatic translation, or instant translation. Automated translation helps enterprises to communicate with customers in the right channel, in the right language and at the right time.
The birds appear to be starving to death, so experts don't believe a toxin is the culprit, said Julia Burco, a wildlife veterinarian for the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. But why the birds can't find food is a mystery.
Laura Schmidt, a UCSF professor at the School of Medicine and the lead investigator on the project, SugarScience, said the idea is to make the findings comprehensible and clear to everyone. The results will be available to all on a website (SugarScience.org)

In automotive industry, like Google, Manufacturers are trying their hand at self-driving cars. Mercedes-Benz would be one manufacturer that you would expect to lead the charge and it has its own efforts going.
Researchers in India have carried out a data mining exercise to determine which are the most important risk factors in increasing the chances of an individual suffering a heart attack. Writing in the International Journal of  Biomedical  Engineering and Technology, they confirm that the usual suspects high blood cholesterol, intake of alcohol and passive smoking play the most crucial role in severe, moderate and mild cardiac risks, respectively.
