Sure could!   The only time I wouldn't present a chemical to a vape is if I believed it were to have the chance of heating up and me inhaling the fumes. However I'm sure that isn't really a hot spot.    hell if you really wanted to, you could put some saran wrap under the center sliding plastic window and out over the walls it slides into, and then cut off the excess.
Yeah, totally relevant. I haven't had any luck finding other people taking apart the 50w, so I'm glad to have read it.  If it shits out on me again, I'll be sure to update the post!  Thanks for your comments, m8
I didn't have the veritas long enough to determine whether or not it was a product I loved - I just know that it never leaked on me and that's my biggest priority.  I've always just brushed off the hardness of building (which is why I own a fogger, the hardest thing in the world to build). However I would like something easier to build, which is why I'm totally into the idea of the Marquis.  However I never had to build my dual coils with only one wire on there! I was able to use two. I can dig up a picture of my build if you're interested.  Edit: I stumbled across my only build image. It's not too helpful anyways, but I still love the color of that 'Nana Cream. http://i.imgur.com/EAEdSlU.jpg
What's up ECR.  I know we had a pretty long period of everyone's homes being destroyed by iStick 50ws. I was confident that my home would remain safe, however my iStick 50w too fell victim to autofiring.   However I didn't toss her, as I'm poor and cheap - I instead decided to take her apart, have some looks, and see if I could locate a problem. I did this about 2-3 weeks ago, and waited to see if any problem has returned, and I'm happy to say that I have had no further issues at all.  The issues I were having with the iStick 50w came on very suddenly. I was getting high one day, and the dog knocked over my iStick and it leaked liquid all up onto itself, and upon grabbing it a while later, I noticed the firing button would not work. I could adjust the wattage, but I could not fire the device or turn it off.  I later found out that this was because the firing button was stuck on. As I drove into work the next morning, the device actually began to autofire in my hand. I just unscrewed the atomizer, used a buddies vape for the day, and used the device on/off for about a week before deciding to do something about it - as there are no other products on the market that I'm really interested in right now.  So here's a little treat for all of those who didn't throw out their iSticks instantaneously :) - hopefully it'll stop your house from burning down.  Here's a shoutout to /u/ddo405 who tracked me down a few days ago looking to see if my fix was successful. It took me a little bit, as work has been hectic, but I put something together for ya.

I don't even have to click the link and I know what this is.   I made a trappish electronic track featuring this guy and all his lawd reekis's   motherfuckinbootlegfireworksshit
This is SO great.
Ahahahah yes! This made my day.
You're gonna make it. You're one of the very few people I see that knows they're depressed and **wants** to get help. That's really great to see.  If you feel that a stay in the hospital would be fitting for you, I'd advise to not shy away from it. While it was a hard experience, it gives a person the tools they need to really begin to start changing their life.  If you want to look into therapy, try out this awesome resource: https://therapists.psychologytoday.com/rms/  Put in your zip, instantly get a lot of therapists around you - and you can sort by price per session (it shows what insurances they accept). I've personally gone with a therapist off there who offered $35 per session over the table, and it's one of the best choices I ever made.  That website allows you to send emails directly to each therapist, and in emailing 4 that I saw, I found that they all reply really quickly.  Just introduce yourself, and ask what their availability is like :)
You probably just made my entire night. I'm gonna go get stoned and watch off the air for the rest of the night. Remind me later and I'll report back for an AMA.
Holy shit.
Just an update, as the GTI still isn't driving, and I'm about to make a new thread.  I removed the piston from the brake lines and the e-brake cable - completely off of the car. I spun the piston, and it went straight in and shot fluid out of the hole where the brake line connects.  I put it back on the car over the new rotors and pads, and me and a buddy bled the caliper (I was operating the pedal, I don't know if he for sure did it right, but he does work with cars at a dealership).  My brake warning light came on - flashing and beeping, but no ABS light or check engine light - no code to read. It was a similar warning as to if I were to take off driving with the e-brake pulled, however the brake light was not solid on as it is when the e-brake level is pulled.   Brakes were squishy on and off, but me and a buddy ended up pretty much bleeding out all of the squishyness and adding a bit of fluid (with where my reservoir is positioned, it's impossible to tell how much fluid to add, but it's not empty). Still had the same warning.  Decided to take it for a drive to see if it would get me to work tomorrow. I drove about 4 miles, and as soon as I opened my door, I could smell it - the heat coming from the pads and the rotor on that side. I put my hand in front of the rim, and all of the surrounding air was hot as hell. Its as if the pads are sticking to the rotor - like the brake caliper is pushing out onto the pads, but not retracting back into the caliper. I have no idea what could possibly cause this.   We decided to try getting a new caliper, [but none of the calipers in any store around me fit my 20th AE GTI](http://imgur.com/nTAXogC).  I'm completely lost and I miss my GTI. Been driving a lame ass Ford for the last 3 weeks.
His is of the more strange profiles that I've sifted through.  Reminder: don't Witch-hunt down vote someone's profile. Hope I didn't instigate any of that.
Wow, man. I don't think your real problem is with reddit. I think you've got some other stuff to figure out, there, cause your issue is just silly.
Ahah, man. This would work as a crosspost to /r/funny as well.

I'd say something exactly like that about the istick 50w, tbh. I haven't been on here in a couple weeks and just now am seeing this giant craze of everyone throwing out their eleaf products. If I hadn't known about that I'd still say that my iStick 50w is freaking awesome. I haven't had a single issue with it. Everyone raves about good products they have on here, and every day that I'm on here I see someone raving about how an order they placed got fulfilled and actually got to their doorstep. I don't know if I'd go as far as to say that just because they're raving happy about the istick that they're an eleaf rep.

Reminds me of the [I'm Drunk AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/drunk/comments/2gjf7u/im_drunk_ama/) where a guy got shasted, asked himself questions, answered his own questions, and then publically berated his own answers to his own questions.  "Can confirm. Have same dick."
Hey, just a heads up on Spew by Gwar. It tastes absolutely horrid at first, but if you let it steep, the flavor of the Eliquid takes about a 90 turn.
Hey OP. If you have the time for a good read, please take a look at my latest college paper. My college research topic was electronic cigarettes, and I spent a huge deal of time looking through information, scientific experiments, and professional opinions on this topic. [Here is the link to my final course paper,](https://www.mediafire.com/?5ev46znw9etboyk) it's in Microsoft Word compatibility format. I think it will answer a lot of your questions, and the work's cited page will include sources for all of the data I am representing.
Yeah, downvoted the post due to trying to prove a point and not answering simple questions regarding it.
Not weird at all, my friend. That's why it's growing exponentially in popularity. If you feel interested in looking for a setup, you can let me know, or check out /r/electronic_cigarette (hit or miss nowadays). I've done quite a bit of research on electronic cigarettes, and from what I've seen from the data, its a much healthier alternative. My bronchi tells me otherwise after about a year and a half, but I have yet to prove that it's due to vaping, and it seems to be a very isolated experience that I'm having.   It IS, however, trading an addiction for another if you choose to use nicotine(all Eliquids also come in nicotine free versions!) - but I truly enjoy it and it's a much more manageable addiction due to the ability to fully customize your nicotine intake.
Yes....  I'm suggesting a plot twist  The Vinegar was LSD
I take back everything I said - old reply deleted. Definitely drunk, didn't realize that you have the new MVP 20w and not the iStick 20w. If the MVP reads NON, there is definitely something not making contact.   Can you double check right now that if you screw in the old coil, that it does not read NON?   If it doesn't read NON, confirm that the two coils you are using are the same size and length. If they are, you have a dud coil and need to replace it with a different one.  If it does read NON, this is a known problem with the old MVPs that could've carried over into your new MVP. If all else fails, try gently prying up the center pin of the 510 connection on the MVP, [this thing here, ] ( http://imgur.com/fb3lLK7) with a paperclip. You just need to pull that pin up a little bit to contact your atomizer, then your coil should fire again.

Thank you.
Been there a couple of times with this girl and then that girl. Somehow I think that they probably see this type of thing all the time.
