Thank you for the feedback! I'm so glad you like the eyes! I'm normally not very creative with my eyeshadow and just wear a single colour if any at all,  so this was very new for me.  I tried very hard with the eyebrows but it was really hard as naturally my brows are very thick and bold (they were glued down and hidden under layers  of concealer!) and you're totally right about the cat eye,  I just got a wee bit carried away :p
claimed first one
**Defying Gravity** because when I hit the notes I feel like a princess and when I don't it's still a hell of a lot of fun.   **Chandelier** channels my inner shower goddess.   **La Vie en Rose** because it's absolutely gorgeous.   **I Won't Say I'm in Love** because it's my favourite Disney song.   **Bang Bang** and **Drunk in Love** because there's so much room to mess around.
I would absolutely love to collab with you, female vocalist btw. I rather sing over tracks with lyrics already written, but I'm also open to collaborating with lyrics. :)
[High School Global Perspectives] Need some opinions and perspectives about Syrian Refugees for project?   What is your perspective on whether or not the U.S Foreign Aid towards the Syrian refugees has been sufficient? (Opinions on Obama and Syrian Refugees)   For a school project (iGCSE GP), I need to get a range of opinions.-so I thought Reddit would be a good place to come to. What are your opinions on how The US and/or other countries have handled the issue and Syria and how they have/should have dealt with the issue of refugees? Also feel free to add any information on the topic too. If you don't mind, I would appreciate of you stated your culture/home country since I need to show I have opinions from a variety of backgrounds. Thank you so much :)
You should've deleted everything dude. And boy am I glad I didn't comment on the last two posts. Call the police is all I have to say. Good luck OP.
Toronto FC is actually doing extremely well this season...
I think the Dutch will finally get that star :)
Thanks for the advice, I'll have a look :)
Try C and Am :)
How do we escape?
Straight up man you need to call a priest or an exorcist or a ghidt hunter something along those lines. If your parents don't believe you there are two options: 1) Explain the whole ordeal to your parents WITH your siblings and say all you want is to call a priest etc to ease the nervousness. 2) do olit behind their backs when they aren't home or something.  Either way you have to do it. Good luck OP.
Invites, Invites, Get Your Aviate Invites Here!   I just got Aviate and I have 5 invites for anyone who wants them. Just shoot me a PM or comment your email! All I ask is you return the favor for any other redditors who need it. Maybe we could start a bit of a chain?   P.S. Aviate is great, I highly recommend it! If you're sort of on the fence about getting it or not, I suggest trying it out for a few days, it really helps to have everything laid out as simply as it is. Good luck new Aviators!
