Greatest success of my life
I'm sorry, I feel like I should add to the conversation now that I'm at a computer. Connor, if it's not too late, here are my suggestions, and the way my team does it:   - First of all, if you're going to use DayZ Database, be warned, it's not 100% correct. We use it, but we're careful. Here's what you do. Go to the wiki entry ([UAZ dayz wiki](http://www.dayzwiki.com/wiki/UAZ)) of a particular vehicle, let's say the UAZ. Scroll down and look to the right under the picture where it says rarity. This tells you how many to expect. If it doesn't give you an exact number, just make an assumption. If it says rare and their are 8 spawns on the map, assume 2 or 3 exist.   - Second, use your dayzdb map to search for the UAZ only. Hit each of the spawn points. This is slow, and not perfect, but it's a good way to check if vehicles are on the server. If you play a low pop server then they will most likely be there. There is a chance they will already be gone, but that's just something you'll have to deal with.  Another way to do it is to uncheck everything except vehicles on the dayzdb map and follow the south coast starting at kamenka, and check every spawn along the coast of Chernarus. A friend and I did that and we didn't find one until we hit Solnichniy. Finding vehicles is a slow process, just keep at it. If you think you are just absolutely not finding vehicles that should be there, it's the server. Find a new one.   Pretty reliable locations for me: Vyshnoye for the GAZ and the south, slightly west bicycle spawns. GAZ has always been there for me, and the bikes are usually there.
Thanks for the reply. She replies with "why?" every time I tell her. Though it's painful that she won't say it back (I swear she was going to, she basically said she loved me in different words [I love everything about you, etc.]) it's something that she needs to hear, and it's the truth. I feel it, and if it takes the rest of my life to show her she is loved, it'll be a life well spent to me. I think OP, though it may be hard, needs to look at the other side and see that if someone is in love with you, truly nothing can get in the way of that.
Rest in peace in peace? Did I miss a joke?
Why is everyone complaining that this isn't his house? And why is everyone saying this joke isn't funny? Jesus people. Obviously it's not his house, any halfwit could see that he is making a joke. And if you don't like the joke go elsewhere. I laughed pretty hard at this, as did the hundreds of others who upvoted it.  Let me break it down to you why it is funny. Any typical week on Reddit (maybe any day), there is a time where there are posted about three or four successful posts that follow the same paradigm. Then, like clockwork, someone posts a joke that fits the paradigm but doesn't fit the same use of the previous posts. This guy did it flawlessly, but because he is not Trapped in Reddit or Shitty Watercolor (no offense to you guys), you guys grab your pitchforks. Calm the fuck down and just laugh and move on. Normally I would too but jesus reddit, this is just annoying by now.
I could see it working on PC, but it's outrageous on PS3. And it will never work on rush.
I've only seen the A-10/Frogfoot in the games so far (I'm not a jet pilot). They do okay against it. If this helps, I've used the gunner's cannon on the helicopter, it did around 27% damage after firing probably 3 or 4 full volleys against it, not missing. It takes about 6-7 stingers to take it out.  The gunship's ability to kill everything with one hit with almost perfect accuracy is what makes it so aggravating. If the pilot is on top of things (which isn't hard to be), the pilot can kill anyone at the plants, and anyone spawning trying to take it out.
It did sound like you were attacking me, and I apologize for fighting back, I was still frustrated by the game. Yes, good thing I know now, won't leave home without it! It probably was a proximity thing. I'll be as cautious as possible next time.  I think the difference between us on point 2 is that I play in empty servers every chance I get. I, unlike most people, prefer to play a zombie survival game rather than a bandit survival game, because I sincerely believe humans won't be murdering each other in the apocalypse but trying to stick together. We read somewhere online that certain vehicles were vanishing on certain versions of servers, and we tested it to verify it. They respawn back where you found them, without your items in them, but in the same condition (fuel, wheels, etc.) as you left them.   "3." Okay, I admit. We were virtually making out... We'll stop that...  I haven't learned the aggro ranges for zombies when it comes to sight yet. It seems a little uneven at times so I prefer to hide rather than walk through towns.  All in all, have an upvote for giving me advice. I'm no longer frustrated so I can take your advice willingly and not feel like you are disagreeing just to disagree. Thanks biscuit!
1. Yeah, didn't know what Morphine was at this point. Never had to use it until those moments. I was in third rounding the corner, and he happened to be at the corner of the door right as I turned it. It didn't have to do with my cautiousness. 2. I disagree about the searching the outer woods. I never do it, and most of the players I ever see are playing in cities or the inner woods. I'm not stupid enough to hide it in the inner woods near cities. We don't play on highly populated servers anyway. The bus wasn't stolen, it vanished because of the known glitch. 3. We stick close to each other so we know where each other is located, and we role play. We were walking down a thin alley that didn't have much room to move around. Your argument is invalid. We don't play PVP anyway.  There is no reason to ever crawl unless you're role playing or goofing off.  I 100% disagree with this. I usually role play, so yes I will be crawling, but even if I'm not, it's usually the only way to go through a town during the day without being seen by a zombie.  Finally, we play the game to make it feel real. Killing myself and respawning is stupid and not enjoyable. If my leg is broken, I have to have my buddy come back to get me.
Yes, click and zombies die.
I understand what you're saying Mr. Reason, but then 90% of Reddit would have to be downvoted if we downvote based on comments which do not add to the conversation. But thank you for answering me.
Yeah, I'm on ps3 and it cuts out for me nearly every game. It's literally game breaking for me. I heard a *rumor* that it would be extremely difficult to fix, however I doubt it's true. We just have to keep on playing until DICE gives us something
Excited, excited, EXCITED.  Then you let me down. I'm gonna go with, you say it means nothing so I don't investigate more, and uncover a truth you don't want me to. This isn't over.
Oh ok, forgot that variable. Thanks for making it known
Bet she is looking in the right places.
Thanks everyone for the replies, especially fuzzybootz. I figured Diablo wouldn't have VOIP, but it sounds like his computer will be fine. He bought it about a month ago, but it's a low level g7. It has a quad core processor at 1.5 GHz, and his graphics card is an AMD Radeon HD 6520g. My small amount of knowledge tells me he will be fine, but I've never actually ran a weak computer, as I've only owned the one I built specifically for being awesome.  Another question if you don't mind:  * On classes... I don't want to match my friends, and one is sure he will be a wizard. I like the monk if I can't play Wizard, but he looks like he can be boring. What do you guys *think* I should play as, since I know no one has played these specific classes yet?  (More background, I play a mace and shield wielding Nord and a dual-wielding Argonian assassin on my PS3, and I played a High Elf mage on PC and a healer for a month on WoW. So I pretty much like any class so far.)
