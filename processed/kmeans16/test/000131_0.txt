Damn.  That was guesome and pretty awesome. I think that to exist on nosleep it might need to be a framed story. The set up you had here about your friend sending you letters was good. Not so much because of the content or the plot as the spelling, grammar and slang. Do an intro, let people know that you can write, and then do what you did here.  People might not give it a chance (including the mods) because it looks messy, but there's a reason for the mess. And the way you explained it made sense to me.
Okay. As I said, I actually like this story. These are just some notes (and sorry they're late.)  So, you start right off talking about "the cold." Now, I really like the types of stories that you can read two ways. You can either believe that there was a monster that the guard tried to warn them about (which the narrator obviously seems to believe) or that it's really just the cold that killed them (frostbite, dangers of climbing, etc.).  I was thinking, to further set up the monster side of things, shouldn't it be called the Russian word for cold? (xlod)
Congrats!

I've seen pictures of /u/EtTuTortilla, and when he's writing for /r/cryosleep he looks just like [this](http://thrilling-tales.webomator.com/derange-o-lab/pulp-o-mizer/layers/fg_single_characters/thumbs/Robot_Detective.jpg) so it works out.
Bob Rowden might not have been the first.   [Part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2sk4sx/if_you_attended_memorial_middle_school_dont_talk/)  The title of this subreddit is really perfect. I can't sleep anymore. It's after 2:00 in the morning, but I'm too afraid of what I might see in my dreams.  Last night I had another one. In it, I was short, like a child. I was wearing my favorite Pokemon sweatshirt. Along with several other children, I came to the entrance to a large circus tent. People were pouring in, wearing the gravel path through the door down to puddles and mud filled with brown rainwater. Inside the tent, all the seats in the rickety bleachers were taken. People were standing in the aisles, and the children and I moved down near the barrier that separated the performers from the audience, a metal fence draped with worn colored fabric. I was in the front row. The audience was deafening and lively. Everyone seemed to be really excited for the show to begin.  A short, rotund man in a purple suit lined with hot pink silk and a matching top hat, his mustache greased with vaseline strode into the circle with his arms out wide. He carried a cane, but didn't have a limp. I was close enough to see that the patch on his knee was made of a slightly different color of cloth, and that there was a bit of food clinging to the corner of his mouth, caught in the greasy stubble. He marched in a wide circle, basking in the roaring applause of the crowd. Those who were behind me pressed forward for a better look and smashed me uncomfortably into the railing.  "Ladies and gentlemen! Boys and girls! The moment you've all been waiting for! Tonight, we will witness a man's death --"  The crowd howled at the last word. The ringleader allowed a pause before continuing. I squirmed to look back, unable to believe that the people were in a frenzy in order to see someone die. My parents were there, in the rows of seats directly behind me, smiling and clapping along with the rest of them. My mother, a bank teller who was too reserved to even enjoy watching sports on TV was pumping her fists above her head. The blood had rushed into her face, turning it purple. It was shocking to see her that way.  "-- and resurrection!"  A group of clowns, clinging to their oversized pants and taking exaggerated, wild steps in huge shoes walked in a line around the arena.  "For our first act, we will need a volunteer from our audience."  One of the clowns came so close to where I was standing that I could smell the alcohol on his breath. I heard him burp. The crowd pushed behind me again, and the metal barrier started to move. I was powerless to stop it. The clown caught it in his arms and stopped the barrier from moving further toward the center. The other clowns around the circle were holding the crowd back similarly.  Someone behind me stepped on my ankle, bending it at an odd angle. I dropped to a knee, to relieve the pressure.   It hurt.  The sharp gravel bit into my knee and the palm of my hand.  In a dream, you can't feel pain, but as the alcoholic clown tried to push the barrier back into its place, I felt the metal press against my face. I tried to get up, but there were too many people. My hand was pinned down into the gravel under someone's shoe. I was stuck, and my pleas for help were drowned in the white hot noise.  The audience erupted in applause again, responding to some unseen event. I shoved my elbow above the person's kneecap, forcing them to lift their foot. My head broke above the surface, and I could see into the center of the tent again. Joining the ringleader was a crumpled body. I recognized the clothes. It was Mr. Rowden and he wasn't moving.  The crowd was going wild. I was in danger. I had to get out. As I pushed through the sea of mad people, the announcer began again.  "From the time we are children, we are told that death is the end of life..."  Someone elbowed me in the nose, hard. My vision faded to inky blackness. Points of light swam and danced in front of my closed eyes. When I could see again, I found my hands streaming in bright red blood.  I was close to the exit. Just a few more steps. A few more rows of cheering people.  I glanced over my shoulder. Mr. Rowden's collapsed form was still laying there, motionless. Nothing had changed. Then he was in front of me, smiling with swollen, red gums and that dead tooth staring like a pupil out of his mouth.  I woke up after that, and screamed like I haven't since I was a child. Blood was streaming from my face and all over my sheets and pillow. In my fit, I'd reopened the stitches that I got in the accident.   I hate that I'm so afraid. I tried not to think about it for the rest of the day. Unfortunately, that wasn't in the cards.  Dad is a police officer, and he still knows some people from Oregon where I went to middle school and up until a few days ago, college. They're definitely not supposed to share the details of the investigation, but he found out anyway.  The body in Asbahr lake wasn't found by the police. A landscaping company that owns land next to the lake found tire tracks. The owner wanted to make sure that someone wasn't dumping their garbage illegally.  They pulled up the statue with a winch, and once the mud had been cleaned off, they posted on Facebook asking whether anyone had recently had a statue or piece of art stolen. People connected the dots pretty quickly, and the police stepped in.  The outsides of the concrete casing had been chiseled and painted to reflect a slightly-larger-than-life sized version of the person inside. They sent pictures to my dad via email, and seeing it like that sent chills up my spine. It looked real... and imagining going swimming in the lake and seeing a painted version of a person standing on the bottom staring up like that... Well, I can't imagine. The thought is almost as bad as knowing that I almost ended up at the bottom of the lake as well.  The tests haven't confirmed it yet, but Trini Baker, a girl from my class at Memorial Middle School went missing a week ago.  Dad could see how upset I got, and decided to take me out to lunch at one of our favorite spots, a little Italian place that bakes their own sandwich bread and has the best espresso. Having him with me helped me feel safe. When we were back in the car on our way home, I asked him if he thought that they'd catch Mr. Rowden.  "You know what I do, right, Allie?"  "Yeah, you're a cop."  He smiled. A lot of guys he worked with didn't approve of the term. I said it as often as I could.  "Right. And I don't know if you remember, but the reason that we moved here was because I was offered a promotion to move here."  "Yeah. I remember."  "I don't usually talk about my work with you or your mom, but there's something that's been bothering me lately. One case in particular from when you were real little. I'm not saying they're related, either... Anyway, we got this call one night... Must have been about midnight, for a suicide -- a possible suicide, I mean. That's what the dispatch said. A neighbor called it in, saying that they'd heard a gunshot.  "Anyway, we get to the place, and it's this big two storey house up in the hills. You could just tell from the street that they had money.  Nice, maintained yard, two cars in the driveway and probably more in the garage. There wasn't a light on inside the house, though. The whole place was dark.  "We looked through the whole house, and didn't find anything. The place looked deserted. No food in the fridge, no clothes in the dresser or sheets on the bed. You'll see that sometimes, with suicides. People sell all their stuff. I guess they're trying to be less of a burden once they're gone, or whatever. We went from room to room, and I mean, if someone *was* living there, I don't know how they did it.  "I was the first to go into the basement. As soon as I opened the door, I could smell it. We called in the EMT's who were waiting outside. I went down to make sure that the scene was safe. There was a guy in the corner chained to the sink, and blood was everywhere. It covered half the floor. There wasn't a gun anywhere. Thing was, though, it was pretty obvious that he hadn't done it recently. He looked mummified -- well, that's not the right word for it -- decomposed, and like he was all dried out.  "It's sad. You know, it's upsetting when you come across something like that, I mean. You don't -- as a person, you don't stop feeling that way, no matter how many times you've seen it before. Somebody chained him there. Like a dog. He used to be a doctor. He had a family. But for a long time, he just sat there chained up in his basement. Long enough to want to take another way out. My partner and I pretty much got pushed off the case after forensics got there."  "I heard that that was how Mr. Rowden died, too," I said.  "Yeah. That's what I'm saying. That doctor that died? I saw him with my own eyes. He looked like he'd been dead for a long time. But people said that they'd seen him that same day at the hospital. Like he just pulled into the driveway, walked down to the basement and died. It didn't make sense.  "So then I hear about this Rowden guy now... and it doesn't match up either. I know you said you saw him at school that day... but the guy's been dead."  "I saw him. Dad, I really thought it was Mr. Rowden."  "I mean, did he act weird? Did he look different or anything?"  "No... not really. That's what's so strange about it. He was just boring, like a normal old guy. He mentioned Asbahr Lake, and opening a studio or something. I didn't think it was weird. I didn't think that anything was strange until later, after I found out..."  "Okay, hon. Sorry, you asked if I thought that they'd be able to find him. I think that if they don't find him quickly, that they may not be able to find him at all; or more precisely, that they'll be looking for the wrong person."  "What do you mean?"  "I think that this has happened before. I think it was that doctor. There are too many similarities to just be pure coincidence. And who knows if it's happened before that?"  He didn't tell me any more about it after that. Dad isn't a conspiracy theorist. He's logical. If I hadn't heard it myself, I wouldn't have believed that he believed any of it.  They still haven't found Mr. Rowden... or whoever.   *Whatever*.  I'm starting to get sleepy... I think I'll try going to bed again.  Wish me luck, nosleep.  EDIT:  My friend Mike called, and he's in trouble.  He saw Bob Rowden talking to someone in the library. Mike didn't go to Memorial, but he recognized Mr. Rowden's picture from the articles on the internet -- the ones that said in no uncertain terms that Bob Rowden is dead.  Mike is a good friend. A good *person*. He's the type of person who would put his life on the line to help someone he doesn't even know. So he did. First, he called the police, then he walked over to the old man, grabbed him by the shoulder and wrenched him away from the girl he was talking to.  He said that Rowden hissed at him, like a feline. Little streams of spit flew from the man's mouth. The old man -- if it is in fact, human -- picked up the girl and ran down the the path between buildings with enough speed so that Mike, a pretty fit 20-year-old couldn't keep up with him. After a few turns, he'd lost track.  The police didn't believe a word. Instead of helping, they almost fined him for making a bogus emergency call, but they let him off with a warning.  Mike kept looking for traces of where the killer might have taken the girl. He believed that there was more time. That's just the way that Mike is. A helper.  He found them near the covered bridge at Oak Creek, where he followed the screams to find the girl, covered up to her neck in wet cement. He'd just gone down to the edge of the creek to help her when he was tackled from behind and knocked nearly unconscious.  What he saw then confirms everything. Mr. Rowden went up to the girl, bound and encased except for her head as though he were going to kiss her. The he opened his mouth wide, almost unhinging it like a snake's, and vomited something large into the girl's mouth, down her throat and inside her. Bile and slime ran down the poor girl's face, but he held her firmly in his liver spotted hands. Mike said that whatever it was that was "transferred," was moving. "Pulsating" is the word that he used. After that, Rowden finished casing her head in the thick cement, slowly suffocating her.  The whole time, Mike was powerless, unable to get up and do anything -- what could he have done against that kind of monster, anyway? He couldn't even escape as Bob Rowden set his sights on him next, slinging him over his shoulder and carrying him to where he had parked his old yellow truck and threw him into the bed.  At a stoplight, Mike was able to get away and jump onto a city bus which took him back to campus. As soon as he could, he called the police again. He tried to avoid telling them what he'd actually seen, instead just urging them to go to the covered bridge.  The police didn't find anything there. They showed up at his apartment a half hour later and arrested him under some trumped up bullshit charge. They can't hold him for long... but Mr. Rowden now knows who he is. He should be running.  I'm driving straight through the night, it's 20 hours. I should be back in Oregon tomorrow. I only hope that I can get there in time.
A lot of sources say that 30% is a good goal for things to be cut in editing. If you've got "I this," then "I that," and "I went," consider cutting one of those sentences.  I like this solution much better in most cases than adding unecessary language to say something simple.  But really, we don't need to know every place you looked.
Reddit self posts are in something called Markdown. It's pretty simple once you get the hang of it, but it tends to eat the stuff you copy/paste from Word.  The common mistakes are:  * Don't include tab/indents at the beginning of paragraphs. * Double tap the space bar at the end of a line before returning to the next line, or skip a line by hitting enter twice. If you only return once, it won't show up.  Here's the [commenting wiki page](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/commenting).  Welcome to nosleep!
+1 for "Wow what an idiot."  Telling it like it is.
I think everyone goes through times like that. Not saying that it's not true for you. Every time it's happened to me, though, I come across something where I least expect it that wakes me up... at least for a little while.   Anyway, intent is important, I think. Whether or not you went for the ride, ask the question of what they wanted it to feel like to read their story, and you can usually make the determination.
Holy shit.
Don't fret.  It'll all work out in the end.  Check your watch... it's almost time.
Vote.
I'm a janitor. Excuse me, a "Custodial Engineer."   It's not the easiest job being a janitor.  Excuse me, I'm supposed to call myself a "Custodial Engineer" now.  You might think that it's just brainless, rote work, but you end up finding yourself thinking a lot about whether you really want to do the things you're about to do.  *Why am I scraping this gum off the floor? It's just going to be there again tomorrow.*  *I just had to put that bag of garbage down because the smell was too much. Do I want to pick that up again?*  *Do I really want to scoop ten pounds of human waste out of this toilet right now?*  Getting into these kinds of dirty situations isn't natural, in the biological sense. Some strong, primal segment of your mind is telling you not to go there. Not to subject yourself to that. That it's not safe.  I found the entrance to the basement two days ago. Not *the* basement, there are separate basements under each section of the school; the gym has a storm shelter under it; the band room stores their old and broken instruments in theirs; under the lunch room, there are props and costumes for things like football games, homecoming and prom. The basement I found is under the auto shop.  It was midnight, and despite clear, starry skies, the power went out while I was mopping down the History and English hallway. To turn on the lights, I had to turn on the auxiliary power generator, located in an enclosure off of the auto shop.  Excuse me, it's a "Vocational Training Lab" now.  Anyway, I go past the auto shop, into the enclosure, turn on my flashlight and... there's a door. And for some reason I've never seen it before, or I saw it and didn't realize that it was a door. From the outside, it's just a little square with a hinge. It could be a vent, or an access panel for wiring, but this night, for whatever reason, I realize that it's a door and that the bottom half is buried in the gravel that rings the cement pad that the generator sits on. I dig a little and find a handle.  As soon as I touched the handle, I could hear voices from the other side. At first I thought there were two people arguing, but now I'm sure that it's just one. And Jesus, the things that it's said...   About me, about the other students and teachers. About my friends and family. Things that *no one* knows. He told me which of my neighbors beat their kids. Which of my friends cheat on their spouses. He told me about the time the old Economics teacher, Mr. Parker was in high school and accidentally hit someone with his car and got away with it. About what Principal Taylor and his frat buddies did to someone's little girl...  It's been down there a long time, watching, listening. I sat and listened all night.  I haven't slept.  I can't close my eyes because if that thing with the whispering voice like a mix of sandpaper and an angry snake's hiss were there at the foot of my bed when I opened them... I'd just rather die than live that moment.  I dug away the gravel. Today, I'm going to open the door.  I got a sharp piece of metal from the auto shop, and wrapped the bottom of it like a spear. Do you think that'll work?  As a janitor, you find yourself asking yourself a lot of times if you really want to do the thing you're about to do, and I definitely don't want to go through that door, but I have to.  Because there's something in there. Something unclean.  ---  [Janitor After All](http://redd.it/2cyxa6)  [Not That Kind of Janitor](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2d4zgq/im_not_that_kind_of_janitor_anymore/)
Looking for ANY feedback for a /r/nosleep series.   I haven't gotten any comments and don't have any IRL people to show it to. Read a sentence or the whole thing and let me know what you think! This is the longest thing I've written and I'm at the point where I'm not sure if it's worth going on, or if there's something I could be doing better. Seriously, tell me how much it sucks. Tell me how bad blogger is. Just tell me if you *didn't* read it, at least that's something!  Thanks in advance.  **[Link](http://atomgrayhome.blogspot.com)**
