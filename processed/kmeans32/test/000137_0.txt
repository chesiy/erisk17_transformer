Good point. I know people who do worse: post art and then up front say "if you don't have any tugboat nice to say then don't say it at all"  and proceed to block people who have constructive criticism   *edit* autocorrect fucked up but I'm leaving it
And let me guess (assuming here:) that when she passed away, the siblings came running back acting like they were the ones that cared the most? And then on top of that started fighting about who gets what?
I love that feeling
Go to Daves sushi and get the gobbler. It's one thing I have had in Bozeman that I haven't even come close to experiencing elsewhere
All I have on xbox one is master chief collection. I should note I have shadow of mordor, latest assassin Creed, destiny, and dragon age inquisition on the ps4

8 months of terror or: "I'm not gonna sleep so that means nobody else can either"   My son is coming up on 10months and he's great during the day but nights are a spectacle to behold. Putting him down to sleep is worthy of a competition for who can do it the fastest. We've had the same exact bedtime routine since he was 2 months and he's not any better at going to bed or for naps now as he was then. He does nothing but fight it and refuses to self sooth. I've looked up sleep training but I don't see anything different with that than what we've already been trying. Once he's asleep, he almost always sleeps until morning but if for any reason he wakes up in the middle of the night, he will not go back to sleep for any reason. He does not sleep like a baby, he sleeps like a Vietnam War veteran with one eye open and the other on his pistol on the nightstand
/r/onetruegod creeps me out. Yeah nic cage pictures are funny and pranking your coworkers or roommates by hiding pictures of him is great, but I don't get the weird circejerky rhetoric of him being a god
Thanks a lot I'll look into that

Yeah, it looks to be mostly custom works so I'm sure pretty much everything is priced at "more than you can afford, pal"   Then again they were at a trade show and to me it seems like most things at trade shows are either snake oil or highly overpriced
And not only that, it spurred a fad where it seemed like every publisher started pushing games with proprietary controllers that would never be used again so they could cash in on selling meh games for $100+ like that Tony hawk game with the skateboard controller. People just got burned out about buying games you couldn't just use a regular controller with.   Though now it seems they've moved onto things like Skylander where they can get kids to beg their parents to buy them these action figures that also double as characters in a game
Relationships, bipolar, and deep rooted codependency. That's my SO. What can *I* do to be the best help?   I started reading a book called "Loving someone with bipolar disorder".   I don't know what I'm doing like at all. She's been going to a therapist for months, and we both go to the same one for couple's therapy. She's a great therapist and I'm glad we found her. It's actually a really funny story how my wife found her. She had made a therapist appointment and actually ended up at the wrong place in the same building complex. By some weird stroke of fate, the therapist had someone with the same first name cancel an appointment at the same time.   Last month she recommended a psychiatrist to her and he got her into a question session to find more out about her and diagnosed her with bipolar, and put her on a slow titration of lamictol, which she had taken in the past and worked well for her.   He also gave her something for her anxiety which didn't seem to work. Made her irritable for half the day because she had to take it before bed to help her sleep.  Now he put her on something newer, I guess called latuda and she only just got that yesterday. I can't believe how expensive that shit is. A 30 day supply was $1600,and my insurance required doctor authorization before they'd pay for it. Thank God they did because that helped a LOT.   I'm just talking and rambling, sorry. Those of you in relationships, what do you want/need from your SO, and for those of you who aren't what would you want?
I use always on status because I use a controller and thus cannot hover over anything with my mouse.   In addition to that, I have a mod called additional structures. It adds some bigger and metal chests that I feel fit the balance of the game well. I also have craft able tunnels which I have yet to use.   I would say anything that is cheating would be stuff that increases your stack sizes, or something that adds a backpack slot. I know that I should be able to wear a damn backpack with a coat but that's not how the game was designed/balanced.
I was the sauce and soup guy, I frequently had nightmares about not having the ingredients I needed to get through the day because it happened often enough and the response from management was always shitty: I felt like I was bothering them with my shitty problem and most of the time they were apathetic about resolving it quickly. It would put me behind on my prep, and Lo and behold the first customer that walks in the door when we open wants a dish that requires the sauce I don't have and then the line is freaking out and then my managers freak out even though I told them I can't make it. One time we ran out of heavy cream and I couldn't make fucking Alfredo and I didn't even get the cream until a half hour after we opened
If any of you have seen my posts before, my original M8 has a cracked camera lens so I did the advanced exchange program. My first replacement (left) was distinctly not as bright and had a yellow hue so I called customer service and they sent another one (right) which is a little closer to my original. I don't want to do the song and dance of having to send in phone after phone after phone until I get one that looks "right" to me so I'm accepting the second replacement. I suppose after a day of use I won't even notice when I don't have a control to compare it against.  At one point I had all three phones so I had to take this picture because really, how often does a guy get to temporarily possess three HTC One M8's?. To compare the brightess I used a fast shutter speed and darkened the picture further
I notice this about every "moving to montana" post. People acting like the person is moving into the winter apocalypse. My parents got me chains for my tires years ago but I haven't used them in over 5 or 6 years because I haven't needed them, even with how bad the last few winters were. I've never worn boots unless I'm hunting, I dress in pants, a t-shirt and a decent coat and I've only recently started wearing a hat now that I've elected to shaving my hair.  Winter is doable without having extreme gear but I suppose it may be necessary for people not used to the cold weather up here since how temperature seems to be perceived is relative to what you're used to
This is definitely the way to go. You don't want to just have the wires going directly from the switch, into a hole in the wall, the  out a hole in the wall and to your device. It's probably also against code so if you were ever looking to sell you'd have to fix it anyway, might as well do it right.
Both will work fine honestly. It's unlikely that you'll need cat6 in the near or even far future but whoever owns the place after you might be grateful

Cleveland Superior trumpet?   Are these decent horns? I have a Xeno from when I used to play more. I'm hoping my son will take to liking the trumpet and I'd like to have one on hand that isn't as expensive but will also produce decent sound with practice. I'd let him use my old Jupiter but I've gotten that thing deep cleaned countless times and the valves are just awful and continue to stick.   I saw the Cleveland at a pawn shop for    $200. No damage except for scratches and scuffs, and the valves and slides are smooth as butter.
I just wanted to share my moment of clarity I had the other day with everyone.   It's 4 in the afternoon, it's sunny out, I'm wearing a baseball cap, I have facial hair, and I'm driving down the interstate blasting AC/DC Shoot to Thrill. Everything is as it should be.   I work for a beverage vendor so I don't drive as much as you guys do here but I do the out of town route so I drive more than anyone else in the sales center but it's still only about 2 hours total per day. But when I do get to be on the road, I love it.
Apps keep getting stuck updating?
Those of you who use keyboards for your HTPC setup, what is your choice?   Eventually I'd like to just get a remote for XBMC alone, but I also use my HTPC for browsing the web from my couch and I want to know what everyone else thinks is the best for couch browsing.  I currently have a Logitech K400 but the build quality leaves something to be desired. I've had it for over a year and the little notch on the on/off switch already wore off so it's pretty hard to turn the keyboard on and off now. The mouse buttons feel like you're barely pressing anything at all...it just feels like there is no affirmation that you actually pressed the mouse button. And on top of that, for the first year I just had the wireless dongle connected to one of the front USB ports on the PC and it worked fine from anywhere in my livingroom and even the kitchen, but now that's not good enough and I had to get a USB extension cord to bring the dongle up higher in the room so my input would stop lagging or outright not responding.
Just to add to the pile of ever-growing LPs of Outlast, I present to you, my wife getting the shit scared out of her   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eolKJDnJ_fI  I'm still real slow at editing video as I haven't really done a lot so I was up pretty much all night getting this together. On top of that I was adjusting the brightness so you could actually kinda see when the nightvision isn't being used. Hopefully we'll get to more episodes soon!
Fuck EVERYTHING about this.

A long time ago I downloaded this song on TESNexus as an alternate tes4title.mp3. It is is an amazing song, but where is it from!?   http://www.box.com/shared/g7cqtrg51i  The only thing I have to go off of is that the original file name was "The Story" and I bet you can imagine how useful typing in "The Story song" on Google is. I'm just hoping someone else finds this song familiar because I'd like to hear more like it! It has been on my hard drive for years and I still have never heard of a source  I feel like I've looked at every single music related download on TES nexus and I still haven't found it

So I was legitimately drunk last night for the first time    Usually when i drink with friends I just take a shot here or there but I barely ever get a decent buzz going. So last night was the first night in two weeks I could drink and either not have to sit at home or worry about a ride home so I said FUCK IT. I wanted to take the fast track so i drank 4 double shots of fireball whiskey before getting a ride to the bars.   I had an awesome fucking night and I don't even know why... We barely did anything! But for some reason everything was funny and everyone was amazing. If you can't tell it was my first real time being drunk. I didn't even realizz I was drunk until someone told me I was... I kept insisting I was only tipsy. I also retained the ability to use proper Grammer while drunk texting/IMing
[Request] Home-made barbecue sauce using Jack Daniel's Whiskey   Not sure where to go with this one...bought a whole 1.75 liter bottle of Jack Daniels and want to make some barbecue sauce...anyone have recipes?
Beware of people selling magazines to go on a trip   If people come to your door selling magazines in order to go on a trip, and they look around 25 years old and talk about "points". Call the police immediately and tell them the direction they went in. Do not let them come into your house to fill out forms under any circumstance. I managed to get my entire wallet stolen with lots of personal information. I've just spent the last 2 or 3 hours cancelling my cards and talking to the police. They mentioned being in Billings so it seems that they are moving West. I'm hoping that by posting this I can make more people aware and hopefully I'll be able to get my wallet back because it's long gone once they leave Bozeman.    *EDIT* I found a site with pictures of the people going door to door: http://www.uscctravel.com/sales_team.php    This one is specifically the one that came to my door: http://www.uscctravel.com/images/emps/chris%20coppick.jpg
