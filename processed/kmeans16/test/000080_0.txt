Also, you need PMI (private mortgage insurance) if you don't have a 20%+ down payment. I don't know if they're giving those loans out anymore though.  They are still giving those out to anyone who breathes

The crust is a prepared dough from Pillsbury.   The sauce:  5 dried pasilla or ancho chiles, stemmed and seeded  Two 6-inch corn tortillas, or handful regular tortilla chips  2 tablespoons olive oil  1 1/2 medium onions, chopped  Kosher salt  2 cloves garlic, minced  2 tablespoons smooth peanut butter  1 teaspoon dried oregano  1 3/4 cups chicken stock  One 3.1-ounce disk Mexican chocolate, chopped, such as Ibarra or Abuelita   Freshly ground black pepper  Other ingredients:  1 1/2 cups cooked chicken. I prefer chicken legs  Cilantro  Queso fresco  Crema fresca  Sesame seeds (optional)  To make the sauce, blend all sauce ingredients until smooth consistency.   Precook the dough for a crispier texture and better mouth feel. Otherwise you will get raw dough. Top with sauce and chicken and bake until dough is fully cooked. After it's done, top with queso, cilantro, crema fresca, and sesame seeds.
I don't get it, was he a real boy or a robot?
At first it was hard work. The stressful days and long long hours into the nights. Many times I thought of quitting and going back to my 9-5 desk job and begging my boss for mercy and maybe a raise so I could family.   But then I meet this beautiful woman who seemed to have a plan.   She started out by telling me her 3 step process. 1) Find an investor. You need a money backer to get supplies. 2) Find a good location to do business. 3) 50. It was about that time I realized she was a 50 ft tall towering creature from the mesopotamic Era asking for money! I said "get out of here you god damn loch Ness monster! "  TL;DR: Location location location  Edit 1: formatting
Looks like a big step forward
