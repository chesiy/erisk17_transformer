I agree, this one left me utterly devastated for about a week afterwards.  The film was a very good adaptation, but it added these additional little knife twists, I cried pretty much start to finish since I'd already read the book before I saw it.  This book is definitely a catalyst for an existential crisis.  I've re-read it only once more.  It's just too sad.
Well, the other important thing that your savvy responder didn't mention is that tax situations vary widely person to person.  We get to choose how many allowances to take or not take, whether to withhold as single, married, or married but at a single rate... some of us are even tax exempt.  Your salary in your area is a status marker, for while I may choose to funnel funds every which-way, if I say I make $50,000, you know I'm a semi big deal (if I'm young) or I've been working for many, many years at a not-so impressive job (if I'm older).  If I say I'm making $100,000 you can deduce things about me, and if I say I'm making $16,000 you can deduce things about me.  Now, my salary is about $45,000 per year pre-tax.  But I have daycare costs, health insurance, and 12% for retirement drawn out automatically.  If I told you the truth, which is that my take-home is $550 a paycheck, you would draw very different conclusions about how far I am in building my career at age 28.
Sorry, in searching his name the most recent thing I found was talk of a documentary 2 months ago... this didn't come up in that thread.  I swear, I'm not being some shameless re-poster.
I like it when a guy isn't self-conscious, asks for what he wants, takes control.  It's a turn off if he talks himself up, I'll believe you and inevitably be disappointed when you don't live up to your own hype.  Girls are not all the same, you might've been the best oral sex your ex ever had, but that doesn't mean you're the best I've ever had.  You'll know you did it right if I walk into the wall on the way to the bathroom.
It's the true things that are the funniest... this is perfect fan-girl in 6th grade logic... I always imagined painting a wonderful portrait (of Tom Petty because I'm weird and have daddy issues) a la Marge Simpson... Fall wedding (he'd wear that light brown leather jacket with the tassels and I'd be in a tie-dye dress I'd never be caught dead in as an adult).
This isn't something I feel I need to purposefully state to head off advances... if I'm talking to someone as a fellow human being, sooner or later I'm going to bring up my husband in an anecdote or some other natural mention, as he's a huge part of my life.  If someone wants to know if I'm available, all they need to do is be observant enough to see the ring on my left hand.
Sorry for double replying, but I had some more things I wanted to talk about here, upon thinking about it.  I think that we don't make the draft a priority because at this point in time, it's a non-issue.  You register, but can you even imagine how the nation would have reacted if they had drafted for the controversial war in Iraq?  It would have been pandemonium.  You have to prioritize here.  You register for the draft, you get a free razor, you'll never be called into action because the times have changed.  My main focus on civil rights actually has nothing to do with feminism.  It's to do with educating the people in my area about assimilation of Native Americans.  I live on the edge of a reservation and the amount of racism is unbelievable.    If you asked me to give my complete agenda as a feminist, it would merely be that I want white men to speak out when they see things that are unfair, even if it is going to be unpopular.  This isn't unique to feminism, but to that casual homophobic remark that is made among friends, or that racist joke someone made that you don't agree with.  Instead of laughing along, I'd like to see white men recognize that they have the responsibility of setting the expectation for what is acceptable and what is not and use that power for good.  This doesn't seem crazy to me.
This isn't HEROIC per say, but a silly thing I did for the purpose of making a delusional person happy.    My high school boyfriend lived out in the middle of nowhere.  This did not stop his mom from being very into Halloween and talking about trick or treaters and preparing for these people she imagined would come to her house.  Now, I was with this kid for years.  The third year came and undeterred by the lack of show the last two years, his mom was ready and pumped about the trick or treaters.  I put a change of clothes behind the bar next to their back sliding glass door.  I dressed up like a boy (wrapped my midsection in a beach towel I held in place with a belt), put on gloves, and a full head mask, snuck around the back to the front door and trick or treated.  She talked about this trick or treater every year after. I never told her the truth.
I'm going to say something crazy.  I gave birth 100% naturally, and let me tell you, there are a lot of things your body does to you that makes it not any where near as bad as they tell you.  I got a second degree tear pushing, and while I felt the blood from it when my skin broke, I didn't feel any actual pain.  Too many endorphins.   Granted, actually getting to the point you can push is pretty awful...  But none of it was as bad as the pain I had when I got swimmer's ear at 12.  THAT was the worst pain I've ever had.  I wanted to claw my way out of my body.
I totally get what you're saying, but you know, a "I'm sorry, I missed that..." would go a long way.  It's totally not fun to feel beneath notice.
Older doesn't mean smarter or more driven or really more anything.  I absolutely hate that your age doesn't actually equate to brilliance.  I think this would be a lot easier for me if I had seen it in action prior to age 22.  Like, so let me get this straight... you're 57 and you're working for $7.50 at a call center and this is your whole life?  I don't understand.  You're bumming me out.
Well, this did make me laugh out loud, and that's always a plus. ;)
List action:  What's that got to do with the price of salt? Variation: What's that got to do with the price of tea in China?  You get more bees with honey than you do with vinegar.  I pinned her ears back.  I'm snug as a bug in a rug.  Your eyes are bigger than your belly.  I've got to go so bad my eyeballs are floating.  You make a better door than a window.  Tough tittie said the kittie, but the milk's still good. (Variant: the milk's still free.)  All the grace of a newborn elephant.  I'll be there with bells on.  You're fine? Fine as frog's fur?
This is interesting to me.  My husband once told me that he never suggests any solutions to my problems because he simply assumes that anything he could come up with would be something I already thought of myself.  He's rather missing the point (which I've told him)... it's the act of making an effort that matters, not the outcome.  It's the same with this, the act of trusting someone enough to tell them what you really feel.  From your response, you're either someone with anxiety (like me) or you're with someone who isn't good to you.  In either case, I'm sorry that things aren't easier for you, and I hope they get better some day.
This was a lyrical miracle.
Because I also work in a field where I'm stuck using a stupid style guide and it's updated all the time.  I do think you're being a bit obtuse here, my point still stands, and in fact, you're making it very more to the point... none of it is consistent or organic!
