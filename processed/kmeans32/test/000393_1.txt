You know, the fact that you're even agonizing over this, over someone who has hurt you a lot in the past, shows that you are a good person who is still able to try and see things for what they are, instead of twisting them around like Ns do.  Also, most people desire a relationship with their families, ESPECIALLY after they have kids of their own. You're not some fickle, bratty, hormonal teenager who doesn't appreciate their parent. I don't think that most people on this subreddit can say that they didn't wish they had more "normal" parents that they can go to for advice, emotional support, or things like that. The fact that you feel something is wrong, and need to create more extensive boundaries with someone who is flesh and blood says something.  The sad part is not many people understand this, especially with the subtle (to other people) abuse of an Nparent. Please, do what is right for you and for your daughter. You have dealt with your Nmom for your whole life, you know her games, and you know how to avoid participating in those games.   What I'm saying is, trust yourself, and don't let the family push you to do something you don't feel is right for you.
After not speaking for weeks, I get a text from Nmom.   If you would like, you can go read the post I am referring to right [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2z4vum/mother_apologized_i_had_my_suspicions_and_now_i/)  Anyway, after not speaking for nearly a month, I get a text from her saying "Your on my heart today...hoping you have a really great day!"  After the initial cringe at the improper use of "your", I got incredibly angry. I was in class and my heart started beating really fast and I couldnt focus for the rest of the time. I was swept right back into the time when I was living with her and dealing with all of the awful things she said and did to me.  Im also angry because she fucking ignored me the last time I saw her when she hadn't seen me or heard from me months after she (quite literally) kicked me out of the house on Christmas day.   She doesn't get to fucking pretend that because she apologized, she can just go around pretending that that was enough. She needs to act like she is sorry around me.   And im fairly sure the only reason she texted me that is so that she can show all her crazy church friends how ungrateful and horrible I am when I dont respond to it, perpetuating all the lies she's probably told them.  Ugh, even getting a text from her gives me the heebie jeebies but I have to keep her number in my phone because its the only way I can check up on my siblings.
Yeah :/ I feel you. Thank you for the hugs
What I plan to do when my mother acts insane   I have a family event coming up where my mother (who i am NC with) will be as well.  My therapist told me to treat her like a yapping dog:   You don't walk into a room where a yappy dog is barking and think "oh no, the dog is barking a lot, what did I do to make it bark??" right? You realize the dog will bark because that's what it does, no matter what you do. You also don't refrain from socializing with the ones you love in a room with a little yappy dog just because it's barking. You're not afraid of it because it's just noise, and it has no power over you.   This helps me immensely when preparing to go into possible situations where my mom is going to be. At worst, when she decides to hop on the crazy train, it comes off more as an annoyance than a traumatic, emotional event. Hope this helps someone else too :)
Haha oh man! Gosh darn Vikings.
Thanks!
Thank you! I can't afford to take any prep courses, so I'm saving up for some LSAT books that are highly regarded online. Preparing on my own makes me a little nervous because sometimes I hardly have motivation to do everything else that's going on, but, I think it'll be fine!
AGREED.
Congratulations! That has got to feel so good. Sending internet fuzzies your way. Sounds like you've got quite the set-up, at the beach! Nice!
I love this!!
Thank you for taking the time to respond like this. I don't want to be sad and angry every year but it's hard not to think of it and mourn for the mother and the life I wish I had. I'm also severely depressed, so the sad and angry parts go back to my "rut" thinking.   I am extremely appreciative for my bf. I don't think he will ever realize what that small gesture meant to me. If he hadn't everything would have been shit. It's extremely symbolic of the role he plays in the rest of my life, as well.
Haha do it! It would look great on you!
Exactly :)
I only drink like once a week, but the people I hang out like to make fun of the fact that I'm a lightweight and that one drink too many can put me way over. I don't puke or run off or turn into an asshole, it's just really apparent that I'm drunk when I am.
Where did you order these? They look cute on you!
Exactly. It's really hard though, there isn't anyone else who seems to have the same experiences and all of the light-skinned people in the room introduce themselves as "allies." It's so difficult when I'm met with so much opposition and people just laugh at me and brush it off, and when I'm offended, I don't have a right to be offended because they think what theyre doing isnt really damaging and that I'm being a baby.
Please take that out! Like /u/daveoldham131 said, it's way too deep and if you leave that in your nipple is going to swallow it up. Research some good piercers in your area, and have someone take a look at it. They'll probably tell you the same thing and tell you where you can go from there.
Turns out this photo is not of the user in the title. Doesn't matter. Whoever this guy is, he's hot.
Thanks :) I'll have to ask someone about that. I haven't had any problems so far, but I'll look into it.
Darn it
Thank you!
Thank you so much! Wow, what a compliment. She is absolutely gorgeous.
Wow, this is absolutely gorgeous! I love that lip color on you. I would say that if you want your features to stand out more in pictures, you might wanna turn up the drama on your eyes so that your beautiful features don't get lost in the distance! Perhaps that's not the look you want to go for, but that's what I would recommend. :)
How did you do it? because my starting weight is 138 as well and i want to get down to 125, and we are also the same height.
Congratulations! Wow, she really loves you. I don't know if I could tell my SO the same thing. I bet she is lovin' your new body as much as you do!
I love this. I wish I could give you more upvotes.
So that was terrifying.
I wanna lick you.
It was just before my 17th birthday. It was unprotected, in the laundry room, up against a dryer. We tried four different positions and lasted a good half hour, surprisingly, because it was the first time for both of us. And, 'til this day, the sight of a dryer turns me on.
Flushing the toilet.
No.  Your cat's high.
