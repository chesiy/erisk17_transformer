Hey r/mapporn! To commemorate the end of the war, here are maps that show the events unfolding. Please tell me any inaccuracies! I want to note I did this unrelated to Mapporn and throughout a rather long time period, so the quality is inferior to my expectations.  http://imgur.com/a/JzU3O  Key: I did not think of it as being crucial considering everyone knows about world war 2, but here it is:  Blue: Allies  Dark light blue: UK  Light light blue: occupied allied* territory and colonies  Dark dark blue: France  Light dark blue: occupied french territory and colonies  Red: USSR and allies  Dark red: USSR  Light red: occupied soviet territory  Axis: Grey  Dark grey: Nazi Germany  Medium grey: German allies  Light grey: Axis occupied territory  Blue arrows: allied movements  Red arrows: soviet movement  Black arrows: axis movement  *Allies: includes all shown on map, USA, other colonies and dominions, and post-liberated France.  Again, I want to apologise for the low quality, I did not mean to do them to post them here.Furthermore, please find any mistakes, I am sure there are many! I want to apologise in advance for the lack of Lake Lagoda, lack of consistency in the shades and again for the poor camera quality.
Exactly.
Great response. Thank you.
"living in France". Updated.
In my humble (and often wrong) opinion, I believe the veto is not meant to be beneficial, but is meant to allow the great powers* to have checks and balances, so that no one power is too powerful. And I believe that by not allowing any nation too much power / making compromise and dialogue effective, leads to more benefits to the entire world in the long term. It also gives the incentive to large nations to want to remain in the UN (eg. USSR in the 1950s). Look at the league of nations to see what happens when one power/one side is too powerful.   However, as you've mentioned, this has lead to numerous local mishaps at best, genocides at worst. Try looking at the bigger picture. Hope my answer helped, tell me if im wrong.
Thanks :)
You are right, that is why I am not doing so. I fully agree that I am too inexperienced, and I do not plan to do so anytime soon. That is why I am asking here, to be able to find out how to find this information.  Nevertheless, thanks for your answer: short and to the point.
A legal question from a 17 year old.   Hey r/Investing! I hope this post matches the high quality that this amazing subreddit provides to all. If I fail to do so, please tell me so. I will keep it short. I am a 17 year old and I invest (shares and bonds), living in France. My question is a more legal one. I am interested in selling 'shares' of my portfolio, which would allow my 'partners' in the 'investment vehicle' to see their investment grow and fall in par with my capital gains/losses. I don't plan to make this a big thing, but I am still curious whether this is legal or not, and whether this entails me to any risks if I fail (I plan on providing a document on this).
So how does this apply to 'les Pays Bas'?
+1 for "depending on what part of France you're in, some have more grass then others"  Thanks for the guidance, being so young I guess it is what I need most. I have trouble finding resources to work out the myriad of taxes and regulations imposed here, and I am not sure what to do. If only there were entrepreneur subreddits for each country (or at least an EU wide one)...  I would love if I could help you with accounting. I would love to help create and evaluate balance sheets, PnLs, cashflow forecasts, if you're (or anyone else) is interested.
Hey, thanks for the answer! I guess with hindsight I should have added that I know what you are saying, and I am proud that people like you exist. My post could be used as a good proxy to see how many investors here are ACTUALLY investors like Graham explained in II.  My analysis reports that I do for the companies I research are around/above 2000 words, and the formula is just a footnote in my analysis. My analysis is completely based on the analysis put forward in II, and I would want to reassure you I do not depend on this formula; usually, by the time I reach it, I already have a constructive opinion of the value of the company anyways.   However, I would be very interested indeed on building this formula properly, and would love it if you could help me.  Thanks again for the answer and link though, maybe even more helpful than what I expected. Have a good day! :)
If I did mistakes, please tell me so :p
Drew this while playing ETW (turns are long)  First map: Pre-Napoleonic Europe Second map: The rise of the French empire till its zenith in 1812. Each colour corresponds for the coalition wars. Third map: Europe at the France's zenith.   Feel free to comment, criticize and complain, I would want to know any feedback.  PS. Imagine how easy it would be to "name every country in europe" in 1812 :p
Wtf happened to botswana
I wish the new unit would be an upgrade built in tech lab needing armory. This upgrade would revamp the reaper, so that it becomes useful again in the late game. This would reduce the need of new hotkey, be a barracks unit, and make the reaper useful later in the game. What the upgrade should do to it, how much it will cost, etc. is not up to a plat player to decide.

Question about valuations of solar companies.   Hey r/investing! So I am interested in the solar energy market for many reasons which you can easily find throughout the internet. I am interested in picking individual stocks (no hate please), but I have no knowledge of any solar company (apart from vague knowledge due to Elon Musk investing in SolarCity). Therefore, I looked at two solar ETF's, found 6 of their largest holdings each, and wanted to find the biggest companies. This is because, in a emerging industry, I would like only the largest companies.  Here they are, ranked by their weighting in the ETF's:  https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XfbhRl9XYBIgPxbqtpNMo802W5MQ76BPgSZVtj13D-E/edit?usp=sharing  I know many of you here are interested in solar, so I am sure this would help you guys. My question is, why is Hanergy so over valued? Is solar city so overvalued because of Mr. Musk? I would love some brief explanations of why some companies are so overvalued compared to others.   Thanks so much! And I hope this little chart is helpful!

Just shows the new lows Russia has reached. Being a Russian, it hurts :'(
Oh my god :O Wrong link :'D Thanks for pointing it out!

Thanks!  Sure is a moronic question :D
Money weekly YouTube channel. You cannot hate it.
ESTJ terran. But what does the "variant" mean? How many are there? Tried looking, couldn't find (I got assertive). Same thing to what is a sentinel? (Explorer etc)
Best country in the africa!
1) What the hell did I just see! Do people actually play on that!?  2) Its true, those colourful boards are plainly a pain. However, why do you want Stauton peices? I was thinking of making newer, more elegant and simple designs (but certainly not abstract pieces where you could not tell the difference between a rook and a bishop).  3) Thanks so much for the advice! You are the real mvp! I can use any material really, and wood certainly is the easiest option, but I really wanted to experiment with "new" materials, such as aluminium? I was not thinking of glass as I imagine it could be easily broken when travelling (saphirre or gorilla glass may be too expensive).  4) Will do! In your opinion, do you think I should?  5) Sounds interesting and aesthetic, but how would that help?  Thank you so much for the detailed post! I didn't expect such a great answer!
What do you think about the ECB's Interest Rate?   Hey r/euro! I hope this subreddit is alive, I hope this post will kickstart a discussion! What do you think about the ECB interest rate? Do you think it will change, why, why not? Will it be affected by the QE? Feel free to share your thoughts!
