Tried both hard killing and clearing cache. I would like to be able to set the clock to 10 seconds for some exercises like the L-sit. I'm a total newbie and still use the lowest reps and seconds for each exercise. Values higher then 15 seconds works fine. Thanks again! :)
I would really love a Alana shirt.
Did my first episode today. Had three zombie chases and the first two was uphill. Really got me working harder than before. ;)
I'm done! But this is just the beginning!
I love this! Have been using something simliar on and off for the last couple of years. I always see better results on the scale when I'm actively logging my weight in my spreadsheet. Now I have a spreadsheet on google docs where me, my siblings, my husband and a friend regularly log our weight. It's really fun. Great for maintaining your weight to.

That looks like so much fun! Love that after pic!
Cute jeans and they really fit you. You look great!
This is the only sub where I'm not afraid to get mean comments if I post. I love it here and I'm sure it has changed my life for the better. Be proud of that flair! You're doing an amazing job!
I think this was the first step to that insight. Thank you!
Thank you!
I know we can do this! As you said, there is just time and I have decided to use it the best I can.
Yes, it actually was awesome. I never thought I would use that word to describe myself but it was. Thank you! :)
Thank you. I feel awesome today. :)
Glad to be able to help. I was surprised by how good todays run felt. Hope you have a nice run tonight!
I love that video! Bookmarked it to save for a rainy day. :)
I'm not someone who quits   I have been doing Actives C25k program and am now on week 7. For about ten days now I have been telling myself that I don't have time for running. Or maybe I'm a little sick. Or that I deserve to take it easy right now since I have a lot at work. No training for ten days and no food logging for the first five of those.   This is usually the beginning of the end for me. I start skipping some workouts and soon I just tell myself that it didn't work this time either. That I'm destined to always fail. Why even bother?   This time I just said no. No, I'm not quitting. So I had some bad days? So what? I am not someone who quits. I went out today and did w7d2 and told myself the entire run that this is not me starting over, this is me just continuing. This is what I do now. It's not some temporary thing that I can quit whenever I feel like it. Because I'm not someone who quits.   If I need a few days of for whatever reasons that is okay. But that is not me quitting. I promise myself that I will always continue as long as my body is capable. I'm no longer someone who quits.
Remember that moment and use it when things get tough. That is what true happiness feels like. Thank you for sharing some of it with us!
I just added you! I don't know how friends work on MFP but if you can se my diary then it probably won't make much sense to you since english is not my first language and I tend to log most of my food in swedish. But calories are the same in every language. :) I'm going to try to log my food in english when possible.
This is me! I have a 2 year old and a 4 year old, just changed career (used to be at teacher actually) and trying to find out who I am. It's so inspiring to read about people like me who have made the change.  I started logging yesterday and today I have already prepared lunch and logged it (it's morning now where I am). If you wan't to add me on MFP my username is Anthliel. :)
It's seems like I'm writing this to everyone but this is just what I needed today. I used to see a psychologist last year and she told me exactly this. I need to start to forgive myself and recognize that I'm only human. It's hard but I think I can do it. Thank you!
I love tea. The problem is that I eat some cake, maybe some cookies or a sandwich (or four) with it. Great tip. Small steps, focus on today, always get back up. Good luck to you too!
This is exactly what happened to me. Last year I was home on sick leave because of my depression. I was so tired of always dieting and I felt like I needed to just let go and focus on my mental health. All I did was lay on my couch eating. In some way it felt necessary given the situation I was in but now I'm in a much better place mentally and it is time to focus on my physical health.   Maybe I shouldn't be afraid to take my time. Those six months will go by either way. I can be the same weight as now or I can take it slow and maybe be 10-20 lbs lighter.   I love cheese and it actually helps me losing weight. Some parmesan or feta is great in a sallad and doesn't add to much calories. That I can handle. Brie and some crackers is a whole other story... ;)
Thank you. You have no idea how much this helps. Focus on today will be my new mantra.
You really hit the nail with this post. I will never change if I keep cheating myself. It will be hard but from now on I'm going to log everything.
Great post! I really needed to read this today.

Thank you. I'm supposed to take the Oxazepam everyday for three to four days and then when I feel like I need to.
I hope I will be able to feel like this some day. Right now I have trouble seeing a future at all. How are you supposed to live if you can't handle being alive? I just don't understand how people do it.   I work out occasionally. We actually have a gym in our home. But I just don't feel like even getting started because I know that I will fail again. Sorry for the pessimistic answer. :/
