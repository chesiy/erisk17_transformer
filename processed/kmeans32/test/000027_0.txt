Not a small luxury, but I'd take that round-the-world cruise for a year.
Republicans now control 30 states.  They can change the rules in these states how delegates are allocated: http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2014/11/18/3593173/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-gops-newest-plan-to-rig-the-2016-presidential-election/ Remember, these guys stop at nothing and have deep pockets.
Your Slate of Nevada's Democratic Candidates (including other counties besides Clark County)
This guy is crazy.  He was all over Clinton and his poor staff who couldn't afford the legal challenges and stress.   I was anxious to see how he would be under GW Bush.  Hardly heard a word.  Now he is apoletic about Obama.
I've been wanting to read the book.  A later UW team was also amazing.  My uncle was part of the junior varsity rowing team from UW in 1948.  It is an interesting story too that I only learned about after reading about it online at UW.  The varsity team couldn't go to the Olympics (i don't remember why), and the JV team took their place.  They were not expected to do well, but won the Gold.  My cousins took me to a bar at Northgate shopping center last year to show me a full wall mural of the team!
Conspiracies do happen!  I can't address your questions, but I heard a recorded phone call on an old tv show (Investigative Reports I believe) that wowed me - where one mob person told another that the hit was on for JFK.  I was also convinced by Thom Hartmann's book - http://www.amazon.com/Legacy-Secrecy-Long-Shadow-Assassination/dp/1582435359 By the way, I think I found the Investigative Report show also that covered it:  http://www.amazon.com/Investigative-Reports-Jack-Anderson-JFK/dp/B000FKP0TG A lot of responsible people have said they don't  believe it was a conspiracy, but it would be hard to convince me otherwise.
Several things:  To lose weight, I have to cut way back and exercise.  I lose weight and need to cut my calories again to lose more weight.  I don't think I can cut them any farther!  I also have a history of yo-yo dieting.  I always end up weighing more than before I started!  I think if I would have worked out more when I was young and never dieted, I wouldn't weigh what I do today.  I don't know if that makes sense, but that is how I feel.  It is also a lot of work and takes more time than I want to spend on the topic.  I do know I would feel better though.
They need to be shamed in to doing the right thing, and Cuban seems to be doing that. Good for him! Fortune magazine had a  article recently about the same topic.  http://fortune.com/2014/07/07/taxes-offshore-dodge/ I read some of the comments.  One woman thinks they are moving companies to areas for low labor costs.  No, they are moving their corporate headquarters to counties like Switzerland to specifically avoid American taxes.  They probably have a better standard of living there.
I knew someone like that 20 yrs ago who had clients who would pay him - and he was respected in the field! I would hear him on radio shows talking as an expert.  But he was just a fast-talker - just like you are writing about.  I knew his wife.  Not sure if he is around today.  I think the only license you would need is a straight business license (but I'm not an expert).  UNLV offered a class one semester on handicapping and I made my husband go - it caused a stir (not sure I remember why), and they never offered the class again.  That being said, there is probably room for a smart handicapper.  The ones that publish in the paper have always sucked.  The really good handicappers work for the sportsbooks setting odds in the first place.
Just beautiful!
I think it will change, but I spoke with a company at a fair and it basically came down to that I would need a new roof, new windows and doors and new siding on my 55-yr old house before I could even consider solar.  LOL.  It would cost me the entire value of my house to prepare it for solar!  And I live in a neighborhood whose residents could benefit from solar.
I don't want to discourage you, but unemployment is still really high here and pay is low for a lot of jobs.  You didn't mention what type of job you are interested in.  If you could apply for some jobs, come out on a vacation and interview.  If you get hired, move!
You will be grateful for these programs when you turn 65.  I also object to them being called Ponzi schemes.  Ponzi schemes run out of investers which is what causes them to go under.  If we kept the money in a locked box, there would be plenty to go around.  We have a bulge in the number of people using the program during the boomer years, but this was expected and won't last.  The boomers also paid 110% of what was going to be needed!!
Unfortunately, I think your right.  In the real world, we could show them the light, then register them to vote.
He's right.  The Republican Party is 96% white, and the white population is diminishing as a proportion of the population.  Two former Chairs of the Republican Party have apologized for the party using the race card.  The party is fundamentally flawed.  I just finished reading "Dog Whistle Politics" and recommmend it for people who want to understand it.  Rand Paul is not a libertarian either.  He has some issues that he sounds great on, but then there are other issues....
Not soon enough.
I love it.
Nice.
How about a war started on false premise, or the econy collapse. Those two items should be enough.
I've been saying this forever:  We need to look at a new way to distribute money rather than basing it on work - guaranteed annual income?  I don't see another way for the long term.
Las Vegas willl be a part of nationwide strike tomorrow demanding better pay for low-wage workers.   Join thousands of fast food workers as part of a nation wide strike to demand better pay and better treatment. Low-wage workers are having a hard time making ends meet while corporations such as McDonalds, Wendys, Burger King and KFC are making billions in profits. Theyre paying poverty wages and keeping the entire economy down.   There will be strikes in the northwest and downtown Las Vegas from 6 to 11 a.m. on Thursday, August 29th. We will be dividing into two shifts, as we understand most people cannot attend the full day.    WHAT: 1st shift  WHERE: PLAN  Las Vegas, 708 S. 6th Street, Las Vegas, NV 89101  WHEN: 5 AM   WHAT: 2nd shift  WHERE: PLAN  Las Vegas, 708 S. 6th Street, Las Vegas, NV 89101  WHEN: 9 AM   For more information on the strikes contact:   Jocelyn Torres, ProgressNow Nevada Action,  jtorres@pnnaction.org, 702-767-2089 *This was cut and paste from Facebook.
What is it with these folks?  They are crazy, unprincipaled.
Conspicuous consumption.
Thank you for your thoughtful contribution.  I saw a book on c-span today that was addressing these very issues...http://www.truth-out.org/article/item/1388:gar-alperovitz-the-prehistory-of-the-next-possible-progressive-era This is a Truthout article on his book and thoughts about the subject.  He was talking today about coops, but he said long term we need to define the type of democracy we want.
I just made a comment on another article about thier craziness is that we need to treat them as a cult and de-program them.  Then I see this article....
Wow. Thanks for the post. And since I missed the previous post, I'm glad you did this.
He is absolutely correct.  The amount of Social Security one receives is also based on your top 30 yrs of earnings - and you need to earn $20,000/year substanial earnings for the year to count more than $0.  I see too many jobs paying minimum wage to $12/hr which will never help to contribute enough earnings for social security.  And comments here are right too, we can never get enough people out to protest.  We have to find a way to get the do-nothings out of congress and keep the good ones. I'm so frustrated too for people - yet alone myself.
Or too lazy to look up and post.  Thanks from a lazy one.
Of course, I know what percent of taxes people pay.  Did you know that the top rate use to be 90%?  Money has been devalued on purpose!  I saw the head of the manufacturer's lobby on c-span during the Bush administration saying that was their goal.  They want goods to be cheap enough for Americans to afford them.  They also want to pay less for wages.  The bottom 45% pay a higher percentage of their wages in payroll taxes.  I think the low-income tax credit was a subsidy to businesses to be able to pay low wages to workers and still make huge profits.  I think in a sense that is what the Obamacare is also - a subsidy to companies like Wal-Mart who do not want to pay for health care for thier workers.  So we were all paying for it anyway, at hospital emergency rooms.  I worked at Welfare and saw the flyers Wal-Mart was giving to thier employees to go apply for medicaid.  What is right about that?  There is another submission I saw on Reddit today that says poor people get the same amount of GDP as do the rich in terms of tax benefits.  Found it:  http://www.reddit.com/tb/15di1o  And contrary to some people's believes, the rich are not job creators.  It is only a race to the bottom.  We do better as individuals and as a country when we are all doing well, not just a few.
I think it is funny.
When I was young, we used to take the turn at Glendale going north (off the highway heading to the Valley of Fire and Moapa), and would go to Warm Springs.  In those days, they had three swimming pools open to the public.  I haven't been there in almost 30 years now, and the last time I saw it, one was privately owned, and the other two pools were empty.  I'm not sure what it is like today, but it looks like it is a wildlife area now. http://www.snwa.com/env/wsna.html There are petroglyphs at the Valley of Fire.
Right.
