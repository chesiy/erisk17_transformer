Lol mate you have to be joking. AoU was nowhere near as bad as you remember it. Yeah that scene where he walks up to an old John Deere tractor they don't even sell anymore which is contextually located in it's natural habitat, A FARM, combined with his character making a snarky pun... Or that 2 second shot of Quicksilver grabbing Adidas shoes out of his closet? Your examples suck and the fact that you tried to say that the product placement in AoU wasn't as bad as Transformers shows why no one has taken your opinion seriously.   Take your [pill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4YwLlB9daM) and rethink your argument.
Personally I am rooting for the P1. Ever since I played Need for Speed II all those years back, the Mclaren F1 has and still is my favourite super car ever made and the P1 reminded me of the F1 just in it's sheer ridiculousness. My other pick would be the 918 since that car is pushing the hybrid technology forward the most out of the 3 also I feel that it looks a ton better than the La Ferrari.   La Ferrari is the last one for me since I always feel that Ferrari are always up themselves in terms of how they present their brand. Don't get me wrong they make great cars however how the way they present themselves to motor journalists and car enthusiasts, just turns me off them. I know I didn't really analyse from a technical POV which would come first, this is just who I want to come first.
Ah yes I am glad I wasn't the only one who got a cyberpunk vibe from the music. The film looks really interesting as well, although I heard it did pretty bad in festivals it will be cool to see what the film is about at least. If anything it will look good and have a killer soundtrack!  EDIT: The [Symmetry Remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2Rk-pLgtYE) is also awesome.
**LOVE**  the [Matrix Reloaded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-URQ4sMzBvA) teaser. I still enjoyed the sequels in their own way compared to the first one and this teaser brought the hype. Not only did you get a glimpse of the second film but at the end the teaser you learn that it will be concluded in a third film to be released the same year.
First time I heard this was in Spec Ops:The Line, perfect use of the music, great soundtrack as well everyone should check it out.
How come the DLC for ME on PC never goes on sale?   So I played through ME2/3 on my PS3 back when they came out, however I decided to rebuy ME2 on PC since I wanted the faster load times/higher resolution etc but the DLC for ME2 never seems to go on sale. It's not listed on Origin and it is only sold on the Bioware store which you have to purchase with Bioware points...seriously who thought this would be a good idea?
Hmm I would say Michael Mann but then again he only has 2 films which kind of disappointed me (Miami Vice, Public Enemies). It's only because they were back to back though. I have high hopes for Blackhat since I would just love to see his take on the hacker underworld.
Ah I see, thanks!
This game. Where do I begin? Deus Ex:HR was probably my GOTY for 2011 and while I understand that it had its flaws, the gameplay, level design and music all came together beautifully. It is one of the games where I feel that the sequel may be near perfect if they do it right and learn from the mistakes of HR (boss fights, providing equal xp no matter your playstyle and an overhaul of the graphics). The art style of this game is amazing, the gold and yellow hues of the cyberpunk renaissance (as they call it) exude that overly lit up, light polluting world of the future. If anyone is interested here are some screen shots I had taken that further reinforce how awesome the art style simply is.

This one's easy!  [Moby-God Moving Over The Face of Waters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3IXg8t8Ybs)  Used in the ending scene for Heat (1995).
I did Day 3 of the Framing Frame for the first time with 3 buddies on very hard difficulty (stealth) and it took so many fucking tries to get it right. That stage I feel really depends on the placement of the items and layout of cameras. Although doing it stealth and getting all the gold is worth the effort as it nets a nice $590k. It can mentally break you though.
Are you sure you don't mean A.I?
Dat scream....scared the living fuck out of me.
It was also titled [Star Wars Underworld](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_Underworld) it seemed to have a pretty awesome premise.   "Basically, it is like 'The Godfather'; its the Empire slowly building up its power base around the galaxy, what happens in Coruscant, which is the major capital, and its [about] a group of underground bosses who live there and control drugs, prostitution..." Rick McCallum  Personally I think it would be an amazing on HBO if they put in a similar 10 episode season like they do with Game of Thrones with a similar budget as well, however the chances of that happening are nil since Disney own the ABC network which they would most likely produce it on.
Sony have already said that the price of the PS4 was not finalized until E3, and that they were prepared to sell it for less than they are in order to undercut the Xbox One, which was their ultimate goal from the start. When Microsoft announced their higher-than-expected pricing, Sony execs breathed a sigh of relief. This was all discussed numerous times in a wide variety of interviews with several Sony execs. The prices were not known to anyone outside of these two companies until the announcements were made.    I don't think Respawn chose to make it for the Xbox One as many developers with Respawn have stated that they are upset that PS4 owners won't be able to experience the game since they want it to reach as many households as possible. It was a very corporate decision to keep it to the Xbox One.
I'm not entirely surprised by this actually I flew back from Hong Kong to Sydney via Qantas airlines and the guy infront asked the steward if he could smoke a cigarette (this being after the countless reminders saying you can't). She gave a stern no and looked confused herself.
