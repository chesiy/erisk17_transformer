"Life is full of suffering" she says with a smile and something like a giggle.  What is wrong with her? Does she know nobody who has been in that situation?  Then conflating the situation of an unviable foetus with that of an adult who has a terminal illness.  Is 'terminal category collapse' a known psychological malady?  I hope she suffers when there's nobody around to give her a Seanad seat.  Not that she'll suffer train fares or anything.
Yeah. If he was proselytizing regularly I'd have no time for him or his music, but I'm not going to fault him for an aspect of parents' choices.  He did tell us that "the information is ravenous. The ticker tape feeds the mind".  I can't help feeling that he knew more about living under a surveillance microscope than we did when that album was released, and he'd given us plenty of warning. Not that we really listened.
Article 12 of the European Convention on Human Rights   states:  Men and women of marriageable age have the right to marry and to found a family, according to the national laws governing the exercise of this right.  That is not an attempt to define Marriage. It is stating the right of Men   Women to marry.  Nowhere does it state a limitation on what gay marriage can be, should be or is.  All you've done here is state that the ECHR has nothing to say about gay marriage.  Please remember nuance while you are advocating a two-tier citizenship for Irish citizens in Ireland based on sexuality.
Tnaiste: Officials in my dept should be complimented for looking to make appropriate arrangements for water grant  One of the many things that really annoys me about Irish politics is this fishing-for-compliments for people doing their jobs, or often demanding praise for it.  They get paid to do their jobs (which isn't done well frequently), it is not the product of volunteers.
Must have been cinema before then I guess.
He applied, but the Gay Union said no - then nope then jesus no.

Oh no, there's a cloud of genders giving me an excuse to be at a keyboard right now.  In fairness, I was cooking for most of my recent episodic memory and this feels like a brief return to my daily routine (which is not what I want right now), so I'm gilding the DA hiatus with reddit and wine.
Just spotted the end of no. 1, my sister hasn't seen the last one so I've another movie on the roster.  My all-time (chosen) movie record on Christmas Day is 7. I'll be nowhere near that today, but hey I can still type so that's new for this hour ;)
Thank You, Lovely Gave Me Gold Person !!! :)  Happy Christmas to ya!!!!
You're right on the general distro, though to get the most out of the board / chips seems to have involved a lot of "please give us more to go on than a binary blob" etc.  That's a couple of years back now, and as far I can see this issue is largely over, apart from leaving out the open-source ideal.  The Odroid community have filled in the blanks, and some members have really gone back to the metal for it.  For the curious, here's an official img page:  http://www.odroid.in/ubuntu_14.04lts/
With a little sprinkle of internet shaming ...
To reveal the target and methods in court wouldn't make sense, but to hide the fact of the court case is the thing that really worries me.  Tell the judge 'in camera' about the details, but the fact of a foreign government requesting Irish data from companies should not be hidden. We should be able to see how many times it happens, and whether it's getting worse year on year.  I guess this will make the US government's case against Microsoft for data held on their Irish servers much easier too.  I can really see now why Fine Gael have never been elected to Dil governance twice in a row.
The spokesperson said the mistake happened because the Department sent the English text to an external company which was contracted to design the website.  Was it beyond reason to simply send them both the Irish   English text at the same time?  They are the Department of Arts, Heritage and the **Gaeltacht** after all.
We're talking about a country that's thrived after two nuclear bombs - survived one of the biggest recorded earthquakes, then a tsunami and a nuclear plant meltdown in short order.  A Mount Fuji eruption could be devastating, and there's still no firm idea when that will happen.  Yet if there's any country that can manage such a disaster, it will be Japan.
I'd forgotten about the non-refusal  high-premium aspect to it all.  When I read 'tied-agent' all my investment product memories came flooding back, ahh I hated seeing some of the numbers there.  Churning investors and pensioners for so little to their own advantage, while looking at the numbers which circumscribed my salary and a salesperson's undeserving commission.  Don't miss that business an iota.
dizzy dizzy  ?
I think this says more about E3 than No Man's Sky.   Many AAA ~~games~~ publishers seem to follow Hollywood (teasers, trailers, reveals ... ) rather than capitalising on games' unique opportunities with a Hollywood flair.   The AAA scene is hamster-wheeling on pre/se-quels.   So I'm waiting till games reach the bargain-bin as there's no rush to play re-skinned games anyway. Though these days that means little against pre-order sales.  I hope No Man's Sky is great and maybe it becomes the 'Forbidden Planet' of sci-fi gaming.  Yet for every 'reveal' of any game I see - I think of one of the first reddit comments I read:  Actual Gameplay Video or GTFO
My guess is Monday will lead to a few more. Though the voting for who is on it will just start again, and then there will be a new government majority.   If it was just going to be a chance to tarnish FF with the details, you'd imagine Enda wouldn't be too bothered about the panel's make-up. So I'm guessing there are a few shameful deeds from the current government that need to brushed under the carpet.  He's like a school-teacher who has been given the troublesome students, and now doesn't want anyone to know they've gotten worse under his watch.
He's texting on his nokia, isn't he?!
Very possibly, though we don't know how much the water will cost per litre yet ;)  Though for [the numbers](http://www.independent.ie/business/personal-finance/want-to-dodge-water-bills-with-a-well-heres-the-drill-30053308.html), it's around 4,500 to 5,000 - you can get a grant which will cover no more than 2,031.58. So around 3,000 all in.  If water charges are at the estimated 420 per year, then ~7 years using as much water as you like! Of course if the water charges go up, then it would take less time to recoup the investment. Plus it won't have that taste of treatment.
Apologies, did upvote it! I just couldn't resist the quote when I read it today - summed up the problems in one go.
So we know Callinan covered-up the problems in the Garda, we know Alan Shatter failed in his duty to investigate those problems (negligence or cover-up) plus that they were close professionally and now all that's left is what Enda knew and did?  That's the whole deal here, isn't it?  If Enda can be linked to the cover-ups / negligence of Callinan  /or Shatter his position as Taoiseach would be very shaky.

Have you caught them in the act e.g. kicking cap-stones?  It was a problem around where I live, and the council came down and talked to everyone involved, when there were definite council things damaged. Things calmed down a fair bit. Mind, it took a lot longer than it should have.  If you've video from your phone (as awkward as that is as a resolution step), at least you could show it around the other discomfited houses and see how it goes.
One thing I don't get - don't we need more schools, hospitals and infrastructure/repairs?   Wouldn't that equally help the construction sector without artificially tampering with the housing market?  Though I'm sure first-time buyers need all the help that's going.
Seconding the money tree [(Jade Tree)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade_plant), will tolerate a fair amount of neglect and can look very bonsai after a year or two.  I recommend they should be grown in a regular sized house-plant pot for a year (or two) until the roots have developed. Then placed into a shallower bonsai pot.  Ficus drove me bananas, I swear they have a passive aggressive nitrogen deficiency thing going on.
I reckon that's a completely accurate way of looking at this blast from the past.  Here's another, Eamonn Gilmore will say anything while not in power to get votes - he's just a politician after all and not exceptional in this regard or example.  Yet this can tell us 2 things:  * Eamonn hitched his ride to the Workers Party on principles of a fair society / water provision that he no longer adheres to.  * He has yet again (his Lisbon treaty flip-flop) kowtowed to an EU directive over and above the directive's intent (reasonable decision making reforms / water conservation) and decided it's more about cash for institutional fuck-ups. Or at least, let his 'betters' instruct him so.  In any election there are 'turkeys voting for christmas' - e.g. the ~17% who voted FF in the last election - but Eamonn's turkeys and christmas are movable feasts. He doesn't have to worry though, his policy choices do not have to read as any egregious compromise for the country. He'll simply blame the majority partner with a 'what would it have been like without us' reasoning. He may be expecting the limited communication abilities of 80s here, as his stance won't wash in our internet era.   I've heard plenty of secondary school students get riled up about this blithe indifference to the net, netizens and it's technorati. As if the net's only an exaggeration-engine and not also the 'printing-press' with a power Irish newspapers envy.  His eyes are on his life after politics. I think his leadership will retire what 'Labour' is left of the Labour party, and his party seems fairly fine about it.  That Ireland's electorate vote via reflex, in pluralities, is a daily awful reminder that the Dil is us. We have done this to ourselves to a very large part.  That is no excuse for the failure of its cheerleaders, such as Gilmore though.
Cheers for the tip Eamon!  I've no interest in this government or any other one privatising domestic water provision by stealth. And it's unlikely this can be anything else, plus I really don't appreciate having to pay for the metering such companies will have to rely on. In fairness, Phil Hogan is in charge of it - and we all saw the suspicious fiasco he caused with Greyhound.  On a more general note, I'll do my upmost to make sure that any issues that effect the whole country will be "trawled in the media" at every opportunity I get.  Of course, in case anyone has forgotten here's a [little link](http://www.broadsheet.ie/2011/06/01/say-it-aint-so-eamo/) to just how two-faced that travesty of a TD truly is.
I use an Odroid U2 as a home server, NAS, book server, torrenting machine, motion server and all of that barely stresses it.  They've upgraded it now to the [U3](http://hardkernel.com/main/products/prdt_info.php) (an extra USB port, slimmer profile). It's $59 before shipping and is even slightly smaller than the Pi :)  There's loads of tips and projects on the [forums](http://forum.odroid.com/) too. I use one as my main desktop too as they're fanless and silent.  Just to add, I still use my Pi for XBMC as its gpu is better at 1080p than the Odroid's, though not by much.

Fair enough, cheers!
