Thank you so much. I really appreciate the support and you put a really big smile on my face!
I said I felt other subs should be included. The thing is, those communities don't advocate the level of harassment that fph did.   An example; Personally, I enjoy r/justneckbeardthings. Recently, the sub has gone from making fun of shitty "le friendzone" behavior to making fun of people's interests, hobbies, and looks. I like when it's about the messages and such, but I unsubbed when it became just cruel. I think that, along with fph and related subs, it should have been taken down.
It takes courage to be open about who you are. Regardless of her shitty political position, she was courageous. At 65, when she likely has 20 years left, she announced something the world hates; that she is a transwoman. She was open about that fact despite all of the attacks she has faced.
So do my pups! Mya is Mya-Doodle-Do, Doodle Dog, and Doodle Bug. Reese is Reesey Puff, Fluffer Nutter and Fluff Butt. On a side note, my brother has a dog named Pope that is a black boxer, so I call him George Foremen or Georgie.
I grew up poor and am minimally better off now. My one splurge is clothes. I'm a 20 year old lesbian, and I love the men's section at Aeropostale. The sales are great and the clothes last years longer than anything I've ever bought at Wal-Mart.
Not really. It's no one besides you, your partner, and your doctor's business what your sex is. It doesn't matter for your employer or for a bathroom. What matters there is your gender. Gender is hardwired into the brain and has nothing to do with stereotypes. Plenty of transpeople are gay and behave in a role closer to their assigned sex. Many cisgender people are butch lesbians or feminine gay men, but that has nothing to do with their gender.
We communicate on it regularly. She has extremely low libido and doesn't like to be pressured at all. We have talked outside the bedroom about the issue and I have given up on trying to initiate. When I do, she cries and then I have to comfort her and then we go to sleep. I love her, don't get me wrong, but if I had known this would happen at 6 months in, I would have either addressed the issue or gotten out.
I already didn't want to go. I see it as a waste of money and time. I have never liked these people and since I would otherwise have to stay with my former abuser, I will either have to drive back down or get a hotel. My wife agrees with me about this.   I think you give really good advice. Even though they are connected, the three are separate issues. Damage control seems to only be possible if we are honest and explain all of it to the family members. My wife plans to deal with her sister after she gives birth. This isn't the first time her sister has done things like this but for us it will be the last. My wife intends to pretty much go no contact with her sister except in regards to her nephew. It is for the best if I don't talk to the sister in law because my anger and hatred will explode and then her father will get involved and it will be ugly as ever.
No, I think women just want someone experienced. I'm a lesbian. I would not sleep with or date a virgin. There is just too much responsibility in making sure you don't fuck their first time up. Maybe it's because women put more emotional value in virginity loss and to men it's more of an accomplishment.  All my opinions based on generalizations of course.
I down voted you. It *is* still a problem. You put the entire household at risk if you are caught. You run the risk of falling back into addiction instead of just use. You risk a deal gone bad and your mother coming to identify your body. If you have children you put their lives and sense of normalcy at risk. It's not "fine".
Consider adoption, if you and your wife can love an adopted baby the same way as a biological one. No shame if you can't, though, adoption isn't for everyone. My older brothers are both adopted since my parents "couldn't have kids" and they they had my younger brother and I biologically. It's great and I'm far closer to my adopted brother than my biological one.
The point is that I disagree with something for my own arbitrary reasons. That doesn't mean I have to think other people can't do that thing.  Edit: the porn of little people I have seen looks like children and that freaks me out, if that's what you were asking.
1. Lemon juice had citric acid, which is awful for you. Look for it in ingredients when shopping.  2. Huge granulated sugar is not good. Chemical exfoliation is better for you.   I'm sure there are others but that's what jumped out at me.  Edit: apparently I'm wrong. Live and learn.
I could say it ain't so but darlin, what's the use?  The darker the chocolate yhe richer the taste  Now if that's where it's at then run and tell that!   I didn't know the soundtrack to Hairspray was considered rap.

How do I tell my girlfriend what's going on with me, and what are my options?   I'm FAAB. I have identified as genderqueer leaning male for almost 5 years now.   From when I was a kid, I have distinct what I call "trans memories". For one thing, I remember trying to make an STP out of a toilet paper roll. I also remember trying to always have a reason to use the men's room. When I first saw the SVU Episode "Transitions", I cried because I thought that my parents had gotten me a sex change when I was a baby and wondering why they couldn't just love me as the baby boy I assumed I had been born as.   I'm fairly certain that I am FtM. My family would not accept it. We've already discussed it. My girlfriend says that she would be very much okay with, but I don't think she would be okay with any bodily changes.  I'm wondering if, if I use Androgel, I can gain all of the effects besides facial hair. My family history is very limited body hair growth. My mom's brother's didn't grow facial hair until their thirties and it was then still very limited. My legs only need shaving once a month or less, as it grows so sparingly. Also, how much would my voice change most likely?
