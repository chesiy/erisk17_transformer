I'm not exactly asking you to agree with me or not, I'm just telling everyone what I know. You can believe it or not, that's not what I'm trying to do I'm just giving people information of what I've been told.

I thought that he said he would want to kill himself mainly because his quality of life would suffer. Schizophrenia can reduce your quality of life quite a lot and is one of the most disabling conditions to have but he cleared everything up and he meant that he would want to die if he got a disease that makes him forget drastically.
The side effects of the drugs don't seem worth it anymore. I was such a zombie that didn't care if he lived or died. Someone could've came in my house and robbed me and I would've just sat there and watched. I'll obviously continue medication if I ever get symptoms again but for the time being, I feel much better without the meds. I've always thought that the medication should only be used short term for when psychosis props up (obviously some people need them all the time, but a lot of us dont).
Yep, the heroin problem is about the same if not worse... I can go to the shop (about 2-5 mins walking distance) and see around 2-3 heroin addicts every time and those are just the ones that are really bad because they've been addicts for decades. Pills on the other hand are probably slightly bigger but definitely nothing like the US, I can find some oxy here and there but mainly the pills consist of prescription stimulants (mainly ritalin), benzodiazepines (namely, valium and temazepam)... Prescription opiates aren't all that big on the streets, because after all, why do we need prescription opiates if we have a shit ton of heroin?
Most people do, and yes it is stupid but whatever. Not our lives. This is just /r/rant, for you know, ranting.
Have fun... You'll be completely fine, just don't over do it.
Opiate withdrawal will make you feel lethargic/tired but you won't be able to sleep (or if you can, it'll be minimal and low quality). You should expect mild normal opiate withdrawal (since you're tapering) but you should also expect SNRI-like withdrawal because of the tramadol, most common of these symptoms is brain zapping. Also, ask your doctor (if you can) about clonidine, that can be helpful when you're having uncomfortable symptoms, good luck.  [These are the most common symptoms.](http://gyazo.com/700b56e973c8de8040a190465a6df9db)
Like others have said, you can't force anything. You'll have to wait until he's ready, I've lived with two alcoholic parents and I know all too well that forcing someone into treatment is just a disaster waiting to happen, they won't only resent you but they'll relapse over and over and over. My dad has been in and out of treatment for alcoholism for a little over ten years and the longest he's been sober is around a year, now there's not much hope for him. Just be there when he's ready to get help, don't shun him and don't ever turn him away, once he goes through withdrawal (cold turkey, which isn't sustainable btw, users always go back either before the WD is fully complete or after, they need a maintenance) a few times he'll wonder what he's doing and then he'll truly want help.  Also, you can also try /r/Opiates (even though it's full of addicts posting pics, they can be helpful) and /r/OpiatesRecovery  Good luck!
Yeah it might not be your goal but if you had the option you would do it (if you were a sociopath) right? Also, look into narcissistic personality disorder or just narcissism (since you said you like talking about yourself). It co exists with antisocial disorders.
It's extremely irritating. Kurt Cobain wouldn't even want people buying Nirvana T-Shirts anyway, I'm sure... Especially the people that just wear it to see better than others.
I have a question. What if someone looks at their usage and doesn't see a problem (when it probably is) or just doesn't care?
You sayin' we're fucked up here? Wanna fight about it? Just kidding, I agree with you 100%.
There's mushrooms and various research chemicals, but that's about it when it comes to psychedelics IME. Meth is extremely neurotoxic same with Cocaine, Dexedrine and Adderall, Ritalin etc. They literally damage your brain, but not only that, they damage the shit out of your heart if you do it long enough. While opiates, don't damage organs at all, the biggest risk from using an opiate is severe repository depression and stopping breathing.   It's extremely easy to get E here too, but I've just not been involved in that scene in particular yet. I've never tried nitrous but I'm sure it'll cross my path, either medically or just recreationally. DMT is something I wanna try but it's not easy to get here I don't think, the easiest psychedelic to get is shrooms.   The drugs I have most exp. with are Opiates and Stimulants. The funny thing is, the Amphetamine I've done was from the street, Amphetamine Paste (Oral). The few times I've got it though it's never really hit me as hard as say, Ritalin, for some reason, but Ritalin is said to be the pharmaceutical cocaine.
But what I'm telling you is just what I've gathered from a lot of health professionals (neurologists and stuff also) and about a year and a bit of opiate use.   So schizophrenia wasn't really caused by anything for me, it's just stuff I've gathered from health pros :).   And even they don't even fully understand the brain
I feel like I'm a pussy for not being able to handle it better, sometimes I think everyone has what I have and they're just better at dealing with it and I'm lower than everyone.  Thank you, a lot. I don't know if I've hit rock yet, but I think I'm slowly getting there, but I don't want to, I want to go up NOW!!!
