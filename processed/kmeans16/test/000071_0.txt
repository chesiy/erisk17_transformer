Novels that stuck with you even though they weren't that great   For some reason scenes from "The Painter" by Peter Heller always come to my mind. I'll be driving or something and I'll just think back on this book. I've read dozens of books after it, most were more memorable, yet I still think back on it. It's a good book, don't get me wrong but it shouldn't have stuck with me.    How bout yall?
Anectodal evidence of course, but I left my theater today at around 12:30 am and streets were empty. I hung out at my friends house for a bit and on the way home there was a lot more cars, around 2 am, so a lot of people were watching this fight. Movie was awesome btw. The reviews made me lower my expectations, and I wasn't blown away, but it was a great 2.5 hours. Better than furious 7
I say $210 million. Those presales are surprising me.
I dont see it Avengers 2 outgrossing the first.   Nope. I say: 90 percent of the firsts gross.  Reasons: I dont think it will be good, the trailers them selves dont scream "must watch" if anything, people are watching just because they've seen the eight other marvel films.  The first one made a lot of money.  A lot.  Many things had to go right for it to go like that, and I dont see those same things happening again.  One thing that might prove me wrong, there's no competition. Mad Max ain't doing shit to Avengers, so it will have some time to gross freely.
I don't know:( Ive read so many, enjoyed so many...  Maybe The Stand? It was 1200 pages long and it never felt like it. Even books half that size start getting annoying. So,yea, I guess The Stand by Stephen King.
Some people live in the past. I live in the future, and I think that might be worst.   I cant help but constantly being in the future. Everything I do, is based on the future. Even this post. As I write it, I'm thinking of the replies and the red envelope.   When I talk to a girl, every little thing becomes a potential snowball. Hmm. She doesn't like action movies... So when we're married, how am I gonna watch new releases?   I'm going to the navy soon, I knew about this eight months ago, and honestly, these months have passed by so quickly and I haven't accomplished anything else beyond waiting. All I do evry day is think about it. I lost eight months of my life. Just waiting.  I quit my job a year ago because I didn't want to be there my whole life.  I forget about the past because it happened already.   Anyone else like this? Any tips?
I say skip this. Read the first one and was severely dissapointed.
I'm in the halfway point between Miami Beach and the Florida Keys, a smallish city called Homestead. Only thing to see in homestead is the ghetto and then the mansions. Odd how there can be such a wide discrepancy in wealth just yards away from each other. Back when I was a pizza guy I would routine deliver to a run down apartment building and then a large mansion in a huge plot of land within only minutes of each other.   Honestly the only thing to do in Homestead is to hop on the turnpike and travel south or north.
And Harry Potter of course. Fantastic series.
Yea , based on a novel by the same author of Trainspotting. Plus professor X is in it
I dont know if anyone here has ever been stuck in a waiting room for three plus hours, but this year, about two months ago, a situation arose in which i knew id be stuck on a chair in a brightly lit room with many strangers. i brouhgt Cats Cradle and finished it before days end. It was great. That again is "Cat's Cradle" by Kurt Vonnegut.
Whenever a server asks me how much creme or sugar and I say none, I try to keep the coolest face I can   "look at that guy, he's a real man, not afraid of anything"
While doing all this do I just block out everyone I know? I seriously don't enjoy anyone in life right now except maybe my sister and my dad. My mom is a huge factor in me wanting to leave.    The military isnt an option because I am disqualified from enrolling because of a marijuana conviction. Right now they don't really need too many recruits so what could have easily been solved with a waiver in the past, now leads to a permanent DQ.
Need to watch this one again.
Me too. Libertarianism is an ideology I just don't understand. Civilization is something that time itself has proven to be necessarily governed.
Revolutionary Road, should I just cry myself to sleep?   This movie is just sad. Was trying to watch all the of director's films, Sam Mendes, and I ended up watching this one.   What the fuck.  This isn't entertainment, this is isn't escapism. Only reason to watch this film is to make myself feel a little better of my own life.   I'm sad and I fear marriage now.
