Just a heads up...
Just took a toke and had that wibbly-wobbly vision for a while.   I think I'm good for a while.  *puts the pipe down*
He sure is [purty.](http://imgur.com/a/GY8z5)
Man, you're going to just have to accept the films more as addendum than canon. They are like nature, they're pretty to look at, but I wouldn't take any HP film adaptation as canon. EXCEPT! The Fantastic Beasts trilogy is being written solely by Ms. Rowling, so that can be canon. We just have to wait.

Harry wasn't a true horcrux, this is BS.  EDIT: Horcruxes require a spell beforehand, and they are heavily protected by dark magic, none of this happened when the part of Tom Riddle's soul attached itself to the only other living thing in the house. The damn cat must have been out hunting.  EDIT2: You can downvote all you like, but She has stated this herself. Harry was not a *true* horcrux.
If you figure that a dragon's heart is probably a meter across, and wands are generally between 10-12 inches, add in the other cores making them less needful, and I'm sure there would almost be a surplus.  Edit: I would be interested to know what type of person is chosen by a dragon wand. I have one on Pottermore.
I'll be there Wednesday through Saturday!   This is our annual trip to the Red. Last year we went to the Smokies first and stopped at the RRG on the way back.
I was in second grade, 1983, and we were lining up to wash our hands before lunch which was back by the place we hung our coats and bags. This girl who was not there that day had left her umbrella there the day before.   Long story short, I picked it up, opened it in the queue, as a result I got two firm swats by the blackboard in front of the class.  The kicker was, the teacher's name was Mrs. Slaughter.
I am a Scooby-Doo fan, and that animated show has been hashed and re-hashed into many different series. There was even an episode in What's New that the animators made fun of themselves in 03 with a "jumping the shark" joke, but has since come back with Mystery Inc. which was a very cool and funny modern take on the gang.  Addendum, I love the Firefly reference. I have not seen one episode of that show, and just recently realized it was a thing.
No, Neville probably made the most progress throughout book 5, and he was a badass at the BotM, I wish we could have gotten to see it all.  "Dubbledore!"
I'll probably get down voted to Kronos for this, but as all of the best have been cited, I'll offer this bit:   "What I am about to do, it doesn't make any sense, it is a gut feeling. I have no idea what I'm supposed to do. I only know what I can do."
Gooch/Kate Micucci was a comedian long before she was ever on Scrubs, and the original lyric is 'fuck you'. You're welcome to google it.
Gof or HBP.  Goblet was such a *whodunnit*, and Voldemort comes back, and Albus and Cornelius are on different planets at the end.  For HBP, it grabs you in the second chapter. I remember my wife and I reading it the release night thinking, "What the hell is Snape on about?" (we had always thought he was a good guy) Anyway we learned all about Riddle's past and the horcruxes, and then the ultimate act of bravery(?) happened, and there was nothing but speculation for the next 18 months.
Listen to me, Potter. Your pal Diggory? By your age he could turn a whistle into a watch and have it sing you the time. Miss Delacour is as much a fairy princess as I am. As for Krum, his head may be filled with sawdust, but Karkaroff's is not. They'll have a strategy. And you can bet that it will play to Krum's strengths. Come on, Potter, what are you strengths?   In short, they were all exceptionally powerful.
