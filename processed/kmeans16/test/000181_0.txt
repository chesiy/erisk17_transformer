SA Seasonal on the taps. Yuengling on the taps. I can't do Guinness, because I won't fake it with out Nitrogen to push the kegs, and bottles were featured in the past and just didn't sell very well. I'm considering some darker beers for winter, but dark beer plus summer sun plus tourist is a bad idea.
There are a thousand "picture of the day" sites out there. Sciencey ones, health and spirtuality ones, puppy and kitty ones, serxy ones...Twistedsifter gives us the best "Pics of the day" from last year.
What the hell is this? Why on earth would a link from Huzlers.com end up in r/science. Calm down folks, don't load up the shotguns and buy the booze yet, Earth will continue to experience its normal amount of sunlight over the foreseeable future. Thanks for calling.
Depends on where in Florida you're going. The state of Florida has a rich history, with many different museums focusing on the different places in history that Florida has figured. From Ocean Pond in Olustee, in the north, site of one of only two Civil War battles fought in Florida, and certainly the bloodiest, to the Seminole Rez outside of Okeechobee, in the south, home of the last survivors of the Seminole Indians, a proud race that never submitted to the US.  Cape Canaveral and Kennedy Space Station in the mid-east of the state is America's Space Station. Can't go wrong there!   On the mid-west coast, you have everything from the Ringling Museum in Sarasota to the Dali in St. Petersburg. Ft. Desoto, south of Tampa Bay, is an post-Augustine-era defense fort where you can learn about the first Europeans in Florida.   Or just check out St. Augustine itself...in the northeast, site of possibly one of the oldest European presences on the state. (There is some evidence that Turnbull's site in New Smyrna Beach might be the oldest.)  This isn't even close to an all-inclusive list. Anywhere that you look in Florida, you will find some history. You might want to narrow your trip down, and then check the county website for the area(s) you are interested in visiting.
Father of 10yo boy and 7yo girl.   We don't do an allowance per se, but I monetize certain awards and achievements. They often receive money as gifts, either birthday/christmas money, or just randomly when I have a couple of bucks in my pocket. We're not big consumers, we focus instead on making things and arts and crafts. I'm not anti allowance by any means, but just haven't seen the need for a stricter definition of it. Glad to change that as the kids get older.  As for hitting, we have always said that they have the right to defend themselves, but they must exhaust every other option first.
I'm glad it's not just me. I like the editing/translating of articles in the target language aspect of Duolingo, but other than that I struggle to stay interested in the site. Many of the sentences just don't make sense, and it adds another level of disconnect...I have found in real conversations with people in my target language I can make some educated guesses about the content based on what a normal person might say, and the way a normal person would construct sentences, and that becomes part of my learning when I find my assumptions are correct, I can file away another word or phrase I don't know, as opposed to trying to guess why someone would say something so ridiculous as your sentence examples show.  What do you think about Memrise? It's user generated, so the good is with the bad there, but I use that site far more than Duolingo recently.
The earliest advent of progressive forms in English came from Latin translations. In languages without a lot progressive forms, like Spanish and French, a simple verb-phrase like "I eat" could mean several different things: I eat now, I eat regularly, I eat today, etc. Latin has different verb forms for all those statements, and languages without that verb structure had to append adjectives to describe the same idea. (Spanish "I eat" is "Yo como", I eat now is "Hoy como" or "Yo como ahora", etc) So in translating the Latin, English took the route of appending verbs to a progressive form, to easily translate the Latin ideas.  [Here's a quite wordy article about some of this](http://homes.chass.utoronto.ca/~cpercy/courses/6362-lamont)  As for the increasing usage of progressive forms, I think they gain popularity becuase they are brief compared to fully explaining your meaning, and English, specifically American English, is lazy.
I thought about doing a bar cookie and then topping with creme brulee, but once cut into bars, it would go all mushy. Gonna have to go with mini muffin cups, and press sugar cookie dough into little bowl shapes...thought I may try a shortbread crust as well.
I went to see him in Tallahassee. Couple of good friends, a whole lotta whiskey, prepped for a great night.  Got there early, decent seats, smaller venue. Gonna be a good show.  Opening act comes out.  Blown away. It's The Derek Trucks Band. (Here's a favorite of mine, [I'd Rather be Blind, Crippled, and Crazy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSbcpLLadX0), it's got a 15 second no-skip ad, but it's the best live version of that song that I know of. L 6:22)  Stole the show. Outstanding performer, super fun show.  Almost forgot that Eric Johnson was up next. His show, while still amazing, was far less satisfactory for me compared to the discovery (for me) of this new thing.  Unfortunately, I suppose I left that night less of a fan Eric Johnson. I still like what he does a bunch, and this song is my favorite of his.
It's perfectly fine as is, because it is. This man likes to see that chocolate starfish standing out from the rest of your buttskin. No woman should want to take that simple pleasure away from us. In fact, why don't you look into dyeing Sauron's eye a darker color! Make your balloon knot a dark purple! Embrace your puckered starfish! Celebrate your ham flower! Love your rusty bullet hole!
For sure.
Would also add a big hurdle for me to jump over, and hard lesson learned..  You are never "done" writing a song.  I've changed my songs over and over and over again. Each time I play it, it seems like I see an opportunity to improve the message the lyrics were trying to convey, or a slightly more fitting guitar phrase that fits the mood of the song.   I have songs that I've been working on since a teenager, and while my friends from high school would probably recognize the song that I play for them, they would also recognize that it's nothing like the one they heard the first time, oh so long ago.
I would be thrilled beyond belief. I've talked to my SO about this before, and it doesn't seem to be her thing, but a guy can hope! I would say be careful, because you just don't know where his head might be at any given day...you would want to tease him, give him clues about what was about to happen instead of an outright surprise.  Let me share a story with you.   Long ago, before my wife was my wife, I was working at a restaurant near the house. A bit too far to ride the bike, she would give me a ride and pick me up at night when I got off, around midnight most nights.  She comes to pick me up, and I open the door to slide into the car, and there she is, my beautiful eventual wife, in all her naked glory, sitting in the driver's seat.  Unlike every other guy in the world, instead of being thrilled about this turn of events, I half-smirk, say something stupid, and get in the car to go home. (I don't remember what I said, my wife's a redditor, perhaps she'll stop by and tell you what dumb thing I said instead of telling her how beautiful she is, or how impressed I was with her being so brave to surprise me by picking me up completely naked.)  What she didn't know is that I had just gone through one of the worst days of work I had ever had. To her credit, I no longer remember what was so terrible that night, I just have a very clear memory of her amazing naked body shining in the dome light of her VW Rabbit!   Just sayin' be careful of an outright surprise...you might not get the disired result. You probably will, but there's that outside chance that his head might not be in the right place...and it would be terrible if another man on this planet was stupid enough to ruin something awesome by not being able to shift gears fast enough!      (sorry babe!)
Alas, Babylon.  There was a movie made of it, but it's so obscure and terrible that I think you can dodge that one.  It's got adventure. It's a captivating read. And fascinating, when taken in the context of it being written in the 1950's. (1959)  I won't ruin much of it, but it was written during the height of the cold war. Nuclear exchange was starting to be a daily concern between the US and the USSR. The story basically concerns a group of survivors, and the run up to a thermonuclear weapon exchange between two superpowers.   This book is technically classified as a YA (young adult) fiction, but I've read and re-read this book, and it stands up to be good at my (advanced) age.  Easy read for people that don't read recreationally, and for more intelligent people, it provides an insight into the fears that Americans were feeling during the cold war. Even if you don't do the report on it, pick it up and read it. It's good.  [Here's the Wiki page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alas,_Babylon)  [And here's the Sparks](http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/alas/)
Profit above all else...but most people don't see past the pictures on the front of the box.   I've been working with the Anaphalaxis Network on getting together some alternative menus for our guests with food allergies, and the one thing that I've learned that stands out is that if you are trying to limit or eliminate one macroingredient from your diet, it's damn near impossible. Things are misleading, mislabled, recipes change and the packaging doesn't...these people don't care about their customers, they just care about dollars...just dollars.
[Favor]...r/dg, I come with my hat in my hands...   In the spirit of the upcoming Arbitrary Day, I seek the help of my fellow Redditors and Discers.   My wife and I took a couple of friends out to beautiful [Tuscawilla Disc Golf Course](http://www.dgcoursereview.com/course.php?id=98) to play a friendly round with a couple of our buddies.  You ever have that game where nothing really goes right? Or left? My wife had that game. And on the signature [hole #7](http://www.google.com/imgres?q=tuscawilla+disc+golf+hole+7 hl=en biw=1024 bih=616 tbm=isch tbnid=ZRm7d6vpuf3NeM: imgrefurl=http://discjag.blogspot.com/2009/07/tuscawilla-park-in-daytona-beach-fl.html docid=YgsrrwZ1FatbeM imgurl=http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9MfYZehXfoI/SnIQEZEKecI/AAAAAAAAAOU/DNvOdVLAQXo/s400/tuscawilla_hole7_basket.jpg w=400 h=300 ei=Uz38T6aeFYWO8wSms-zcBg zoom=1 iact=hc vpx=282 vpy=114 dur=5281 hovh=194 hovw=259 tx=118 ty=117 sig=111693889434370404481 page=1 tbnh=131 tbnw=175 start=0 ndsp=15 ved=1t:429,r:6,s:0,i:91) my wife put not one, but both of her drivers in the lake. A rare pink pro Beast, and her favorite Millenium Astra.  This park will recover discs, I think, but it could be awhile, months even, before they turn up in the local seller's trailer. (She does have name and number on them.) This leaves my wife without drivers to play...and we play two to three times a week.   So here's my problem...we're so broke lately we can't even pay attention...and I just don't know if I can free up the money to replace those discs. Maybe two weeks from now, I might be able to pick something up in a DX for her, but it will be a bit before I can get her some quality plastics again.  DG is such a great way for us to get out, and our kids love the time spent in the park, and it pains me to see my wife in such foul spirits after losing her two favorite discs, and not be able to do anything about it.  So here's my begging....if any of you have an extra driver laying around, something you're tired of seeing, or just a disc that you feel needs someone who will love it, learn with it, and try to keep it out of lakes, please PM me and let me know you can help.  I would be willing to reimburse shipping, but like I said before, we're way broke and it might be a minute, but I do pay my debts, or if you're interested in trade, my wife is quite the crafty one. (Here's some [bag tags](http://www.reddit.com/tb/vosw5) that we made for our little start up club.)....maybe we could work something out in trade?   At the very least, thanks for taking the time to listen to the lament of amateurs who can't keep their discs out of the water...lol. (I've been in that lake a time or two as well, but on the edge...she sank **both** of them in the middle.)  Happy discing!
