Me: I like rock, hip hop, kpop.. Annoying person: GANGNAM STYLE!! Me: NO.
nope, scotland I'm afraid :)
What is medicare and how does it compare to the NHS?   FYI - I'm scottish.
When I was in school I overheard a girl telling her friends that her mum once sat in the bath and squirted milk from her breast into the mouth of her baby who sat on the bathroom floor. She was adamant it was true. Mocking ensued.
Ah merci! Quel est tue e-mail? PM
je ne bien parle pas en francais mais je parle en peu.
She knows what she wants and it's a nintendo ds.
I'm Scottish and I'm ginger and freckly. That's where it ends.
lo que es ochodos?
Oh I'm not sure! Finnish is meant to be quite hard. Maybe when I have some experience with new languages I could try to hop on the finnish bandwagon :P
yes very much so! Hi :)
He's very persistent. How do I tell someone I'm not interested?
Yep I know I saw it after I posted to imgur but couldn't be bothered to change it.
Got this today - Struggling to make conversation then promise of dirty talk.. nice.
Until now, I never even thought about looking at depression books. My Christmas Give is going to be so helpful, thank you!
Saw this add on OkCupid. Check it real good! [NSFW]
I look up at a light source at say pineapple and my urge to sneeze is gone.
He looks really regal and in charge. What about captain, King/Prince or Sargeant (Sarge for short)?
Artie, Bailey, Hero or Simba. He is so cute!
Nothing of importance? I thought 1984 was wrote there? That's something I guess. Plus when famous people visit the islands they tend to skip over Islay and go to Jura which annoys me because I just think 'Come to our island, Jura has like NOTHING on it!' but yeah.
If you have been diagnosed by a medical professional then they should damn well do that. Surely they have support for those with a physical ailment so it should be the same for a mental ailment.
I'm not sure if it changes where you are from but as long as you have a medical note from your doctor and you have been experiencing problems with it then you should 'qualify'. They can't reject you because people need to realise this is a real condition and it has real affects to daily life. Whether you are in uni or have a job or both - depression can make it a lot harder to keep up and get by.
I secretly do so I'll wait til they bring it up and then start my guns.
I'm quite jealous of you. My older pig just tolerates me with no enthusiasm and my younger pig is learning from her!
I'm 18 and I usually pop by r/scotland but have recently added r/edinburgh to that.
I'll try it sometime. I went to cafe Andaluz recently which had lovely food and that was tapas so I should enjoy empires cafe too.
oh awesome! where are they all?
Can you help me find the name of this book? It has something to do with an amulet?   There is a girl who is an orphan and lives with maids of a house (its set in either the 19th or 20th century). She either finds an amulet or is in possession of an amulet. Either way, word gets around and a woman comes knocking claiming to be her mother, who takes her away to live with her. I think part of the book is set in Venice. In the end, the girl realizes that the woman was not her mother but forgives her anyway. Does anyone know this book?
she is saying how its hypocritical that her mum won't allow her birth control (because its against Catholicism) yet her mum is a lesbian (which is also against Catholicism)
I am going in to get a diagnosis tomorrow and was wondering if anyone had any tips to someone who gets anxious when talking about feelings and personal issues?   I have avoided talking about personal things and my true feelings since I can remember and am really anxious about my doctor's appointment today. Just to be prepared I have printed out a PHQ and filled it in but I'm still really nervous and panicky. Any tips?  EDIT: Thanks everyone! I had my appt. and it went really well. She was straightforward, actually listened to me and then gave me a perscription and told me to use my free uni councelling service. It really helped that I braught with me the PHQ. I now have a perscription for fluoxetine.
I need absolute quiet when I'm sleeping. Thats the reason I wear headphones to bed (it's done the trick til now). Rain sounds sooth me but I can't fall asleep with them. Thanks though!
whats a white noise machine?
