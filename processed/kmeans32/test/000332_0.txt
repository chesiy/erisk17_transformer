Haha
No.
This is one of the only posts on here that actually made me go "what the FUCK?" Good job, OP.
I don't get it
It's good, very bloody lol.  They eventually leave the farm, imho it gets a lot better once they do that   It's a good show, but you aren't really missing out. It's like, I would recommend it but there's other shows I would tell you to watch first.  Archer, Under the Dome  [Can't Feel My Face - The Weeknd](https://youtu.be/dqt8Z1k0oWQ), [Actual Cannibal Shia LeBouf]( https://youtu.be/o0u4M6vppCI)
Thanks, I'll look into it later :)
Awesome, thanks.
I do, actually. My dad is a cop since I was pretty little he would take me to the range every weekend. I now have a couple rifles to take with me.  My username was an old Xbox Gamertag. About a year ago when I made this account I couldn't think of anything else so I just stuck with it.  I'm having a "falling out" (I can't think of another word, sorry) with my parents, but I guess that's it.  Lol, that's all I have to say for that one. Yeah, it's *SUPER DUPER* being 13!!!!!!!!1!1!1111  Being able to shave(no, really) everyone else does it, and I grow hella hair.
I can take you through them! Just message Moreos, I'll be on tomorrow!
Yes.
Just a few months, and I can get out. I can wait. None of my teachers like me, or will listen to me. I talk too much and try to get attention, since at home I don't get much. My birthday is in May, I can make it.

What console?
What is your favorite color?
That's great. Naturevideo games. Get out and explore.   It seems like everyone I meet that has a mic just wants to point a gun at my head and make me join the crew. I would rather get shot a million times than join a crew with those douches. But I'm sure sometime I'll find a good crew and some friends. Thanks for taking the time to write all this out, I hope you don't get eaten by a bear, and I'm on mobile so sorry if I made a bunch of spelling errors. Farewell, pleasant internet friend.
99.9% of people just rubbed their eyes to see if it still works.
I added you.  :D
I can't go 45 minutes without listening to ed Sheeran.   My family is starting to get mad at me for not paying attention to them. I just love his new album so much I feel I HAVE to listen to it.
I hace been redditing so much i can arely read anything. AMA   I'll try to answer anything the best I can!
Why?
Either Herobrine ( the "evil ghost" of minecraft) or there was a Creeper behind him, the well was from villagers, the mobs are glitchy, and Endermen are taking blocks. :P I'm going with Herobrine.
