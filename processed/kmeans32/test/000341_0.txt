That's not only really cool, but it also makes a lot of sense... But 1km of wire sounds both heavy and like it'd take up a lot of room for something with 'nano' in its title.  I was thinking more a compressed co2 cartridge (like a bb gun) that either slowed it down or pushed it down such that its orbit would begin to decay pretty quickly.  But, hell, the 1km spool of conducting 'nanowire' may end up being able to both take up less room *and* weigh less.  Either way, it's a 'doable' thing if they think to incorporate it

In a stunning discovery that overturns decades of textbook teaching, researchers at the University of Virginia School of Medicine have determined that the brain is directly connected to the immune system by vessels previously thought not to exist.  Learn something new every day. Never underestimate what we'll learn 'tomorrow'
4th paragraph   The improvement in condenser heat transfer, which is just one step in the power-production cycle, could lead to an overall improvement in power plant efficiency of 2 to 3 percent based on figures from the Electric Power Research Institute, Preston says  enough to make a significant dent in global carbon emissions, since such plants represent the vast majority of the worlds electricity generation.
Probably for the best...it motivated me to *not* spend the next hour writing a useless rant explaining why corn, soy, okra, open-field agriculture, etc is the least efficient way to farm given their circumstances. How the density of food could be increased as well blight containment could be decreased by growing in greenhouses.  Why go to a planet that could cost you decades when Plan A's goal is to save those on a 'dying' earth. How the gravitational forces of a black hole would crush a ship faster than a coke can at the bottom of an abyss. How a frozen cloud wouldn't float esp with the weight of a spaceship on it...even *on* a planet with 80% the gravity of earth. How the energy needed for escape velocity couldn't be contained in a ship of that size without dumpable booster rockets... And how if it did (nuclear, fusion, 'something'), it'd be an energy source that could *save* earth in the first place.  ...there were multiple points throughout that film that had me wanting to get up and turn it off and vomit from the stupidity I was watching.

Cool. Hopefully it serves as a deterrent against Israeli surprise bombings of their nuclear sites.  World powers (namely the US) can 'easily' navigate through this, counter it, and otherwise overwhelm it ... if need be, but Israel would likely have a more difficult time, would take more of a hit, and would less likely to recover quickly enough should Iran choose to retaliate quickly.  'Those kids' need to cool their saber rattling   war mongering b.s. ...and these are an advanced enough system *to* keep it at just that: saber rattling rhetoric vs actual escalation to all out war.  Seriously doubt Russia would be doing this with*out* a US head-nod condoning of it...at least on the Obama-side of US politics anyway. Though I'm sure it'll ruffle the Likud Party fanboys in the GOP's feathers more than a bit.  Good signs the inner circle members of the US   Russia are finding a common ground. Hopefully it'll help to deescalate tensions between US   Russia *else*where as well

but it only stops shockwaves (one of the few things Star Trek and other science fiction shields don't seem to stop)  awesome! so this is tech that's even *more* advanced than Star Trek!
yeah, I've seen that video... lots of them actually. but, that one almost in particular was what was running through my head when i typed that.  It isn't so much the transport on that level... I feel that part's pretty well down.  like, case-by-case I don't see transport as an issue. It's the scale, and the number of variables that have open opportunities for human or mechanical error to come into play.  Like I said, I'm all for storing the stuff... and, thus, storing it somewhere that's not necessarily immediately accessible to the plant... Louisiana is a long way away from, say, Ny or Oregon or wherever nuke plants are... ...   it's just he entire supply chain. people slack off. get lazy. have bad days. ... ...politics   other pressures intervene. budget cuts, environmental groups.   f'ing gremlins.  whatever the countless myriad of 'things' that happens when 'shit doesn't go right'  look at the services industry.... sure on a day to day scenario, shit works... but, go talk to a computer tech or phone tech person... ... or just a simple car mechanic... or plumber ... constantly 'things' are f'ed up.  for the most part they work, but on a case by case scenario, each 'thing' has its own set of problems.  lots of redundancy, lots of annoying safety protocols, lots of observation, ... tons of observation.   moving around a train filled with nuclear waste isn't something that should be done 'in a rush'.  but, that said, yeah, I think the basic individual variables are in place ... *except* the long term storage site.  for that, Yucca is a joke. always has been, imo.   there are just too many inherent flaws in it... ...over, again, the salt domes.  hell, the salt domes are *why* we use them for the strategic petroleum reserve ... they're 'war hardened' super safe, and designed to get through whatever the latter half of the 20th century was going to throw at it.  I believe they can even take direct hits from nukes and shit.  like, even a drilling bunker buster nuke would only make it so many feet into one, blow up, and, all the salt would just 'fuse together' and 'heal'.  they're on levels of stability that are so for over a hundred million years.   dinosaurs have risen, fallen, re-risen, and been wiped out entirely since those things formed ... and, they're set to last another 250 million years into the future.   *that* Yucca was even considered over those is beyond me.
part II  kinda sorta the same thing as swapping. but, the idea of renting one would be 'to make it to the destination' ... so, say, you live in Chicago but want to drive to, say, NYC... you won't need to *own* a trailer (which you could if you wanted to, but if you're only using it to drive to Aunt Edna's in Manhattan once a year, why own a $15k trailer?)...  you just go rent one from the dealership..  but, again, in this seamless 'app' style prearranged rental agreement deal.  when you leave on Friday after work, you pick up your Chicago-trailer at the dealership/rental place.  drive to NYC, drop it off at the place in NYC... spend your week in manhattan... go back and pick up another one for your drive back... ...be it the same one, a different one, who cares? what's it matter? you're keeping it for a day to drive the 800 mile trip.  at night? you can stay at a hotel with a charge station, or, you can just stay at some $50 a night MicroTel and leave the trailer hooked up to the car... and the trailer will run through the night charging the batteries of the car up.... then just fill the trailer with fuel before you leave whatever-smalltown-Pennsylvania you crashed in for the night in case the 250 mile charge   150 miles in the tank isn't enough to make it because you stopped at 350 miles instead of 400 in 'cause it was friday night and you'd worked all day/week.    trailer filled with gas when you drop it off? costs less than the gas charge the dealership/rental place is going to charge you.. ...just like what happens when you rent a car.  bring it back at the same place it was when you picked it up? $0 fuel charge. bring it back empty, they charge you 150% going rate for fuel + a fill up fee just because they can.  the biggest deal here? it uses an already existing infrastructure (gas stations) and, thus, an already existing fuel-road tax because, afterall, you *are* using road fuel (road gas/diesel) ... vs farm grade fuel.  but, while in your destination? you don't have to fuck with the trailer 'cause you dropped it off.   if it's *your* trailer? again, make them 'parking spot safe' .. so, make it lock up nicely like a car.  thus, someone stealing your trailer or breaking into it would be like stealing or breaking into a parked car... would be even cooler if the system had a built in cellphone type device.. like how the tesla has its own cell connection deal... just so it's 'connected ot the grid' too... ie, your phone/devices. that way if it *is* broken in to, it doesn't just 'beep' or 'honk' (like a car), but it also sends you a message, turns on audio so you can listen, has gps, as well has the ability to call the cops to report the theft in progress... and, of course, track it notifying you/the police where it is until they can arrest the fuckers who tried to jack your shit.  back to oil companies still getting a piece? yeah, absolutely. sure they lose funds for ev's around town... ie, 99% of the time.. people can just fill up at home off solar, wind, geothermal, the grid, whatever ... ....but, they're losing that anyway even now (not really, they own the patents on all the batteries. oil companies aren't losing shit) ... but they get the money for the 'long hauls'.
I would definitely need a gas car to drive to my parents place  still don't understand why pure-electric manufacturers don't make a petro-fueled generator-trailer...  make it look like the car, same color, uses the same key to unlock it, etc.  hook it up to the hitch, plug it into the electrical system (power, data, etc) .... fill it up with fuel... drive.  the engine/generator would be designed to do one thing.... at one single power-rating: provide electricity.    no variability, no 'ups   downs' in power output to match driving-type.  it literally is designed to do one (maybe two) speeds: 1) provide electricity to charge batteries 2) provide a bit more juice to charge batteries *while* adjusting to the average demand of that. specific. trip. up to that point.  if the batteries get above, say, 10-15 miles of juice left. it turns off.  if they dip below 10 miles of juice left, the engine turns on and provides power until the batteries are both fully charged, and the power-demand is met.  not much different than, say, a phone.  ie, like a G3 :) or, even better, my M8.  plugged in, it both powers the phone   charges the battery. once the battery is full, the charge-controller switches to battery until it drops to, say, 95%, then it powers the phone and charges the battery again.  say you get to where you're going (your 500km away destination). you back it up in a back parking spot at your hotel, your parents house, the local dealership for your car, 'rest area', 'charging station' wherever 'deals' have been made to allow for parking generators (maybe for a small fee if an independent ... like a gas station, rest area, commercial/retail-location parking lot, wherever... ... or, if a dealership, hotel, whatever, park for free.  disconnect it, lock it up (just like you would a car), leave it for the duration of your 'local trip'. drive around trailer-less  or, better, make them 'rentable' *from* the local dealership, enterprise, whatever place chooses to rent 'range extender trailer-generators'.  ...hell, if you rent one from, say, Enterprise? get to park it *at* the local Enterprise while you're at your trip's destination... either paying a reduced 'holding fee' for your trip... or, if there long enough or motivatd enough, returning it to them only to pick up another one at a pre-scheduled time a week later after your trip... ..only to drop *that* one off at your local enterprise location once you return home.  just a 'thing' that's 'bugged me' for a few years now about range anxiety and ev's.  but, to (continue to) elaborate on it a bit: the size of the engine-trailer towed would be relative to the size of the car. make all cars you want to have this option be upgraded to handle it.   in such: the trailer is being trailed, not a part of the weight of the car itself... so, no need for suspension of the car to be upgraded to handle the added weight.  the brakes would need to be strong enough to handle it, but if you combine regenerative braking with slightly increased rotors   pads... it'd adjust around this ~1000lbs in added weight.  the generator *can* have a few speeds... an 'idle' of course, thouhg this would be used rarely as the engine would be more designed to just 'turn on/turn off' at predetermined power-demand points communicated from the car *to* the trailer.   then a different speed based on demand.... with a 'full' speed being strong enough to power the car at '100% electrical demand' as *well* have 'excess power' to charge the batteries at a 'realistic rate'.     the entire thing has a data cable designed to hook into the car's onboard computer in such that the indash interface (or phone or other app) can control it   need to get gas? simply pull over and.. fill the generator up with gas/diesel.  The power fluctuations are minimal. no 'stop   go' b.s.  very controlled, very predictable power curves. designed for efficiency, *not* performance (you're pulling a trailer after all, it's *not* like you're taking 90 degree turns at lightening speeds or trying to go 0-60 like none other)  the smaller the car? the smaller the trailer'd need to be... so, it scales up   down with the car size.   again, best if made by the manufacturer for that specific model... ie, model-specific, and even cooler if designed to look like a part of the car (same color, same key, etc... ...if purchased, *not* rented, of course) .. ...  stealing one? would be the same as stealing a car and/or a trailer. thus, fines, potential prison time, etc.    either way, would definitely 'hybridize' things, as well provide a solution to range anxiety ... while *also* reducing the amount of time an electric has to pull over to 'refill' their energy requirements (gas pumps a *lot* faster than even 960v supercharger charging stations, if such high voltage fast-charge stations even exist... I *think* Finland or Norway or somewhere was talking about doing 720v or even 840v stations, but I can't find a link)  I really like ev's though. TONS of power and almost immediately.  I also like the idea (again, being an Audi/quattro fan) of independently powered tires.... Teslas X has dual engines, with a more traditional mechanical system to control power output per tire... per axle....  ...I forget why Musk said he went with a dual-engine (front/back) with the Model X vs 4 independent engines per tire... has something to do with weight/efficiency ... but, the idea that you can power an individual tire with an independent engine and, thus, control on a microsecond level the power output per tire... traction, turning, etc... ...  as *well* the fact that the power from the electric motor *to* the tire is almost immediate... no (significant) build up in power needed... vs a gas engine... ...instant full-power torque *and* the handling to match.  the weight can be centered differently as well such as to balance the car side to side / front to back axises, as well it can have a really low-to-the-ground weight deal... so the car (truck, suv, sav, hybrid design, whatever) *isn't* top-heavy....  fast! fun! efficient!   I'm incredibly excited for the future of the car  me too! esp since much of the tech seemingly overlaps with that of phones.  I'm sure the OP is getting a bit annoyed with our car talk on his G3 self-post. so I'm gonna chime out of this but... that last quote is definitely a shared sentiment :)
I really have nothing to add because I agree with all of it.  my only wonder is: what if they put radar into drones in such that the drone could detect an oncoming 'something' and be auto-programmed to 'take action' (which would basically mean turn off the engines and drop as quickly as possible ... turning engines back on once the 'minimal safe distance' is achieved and/or the ground is right there)  again,with everything else you've written... totally agree. nothing to add.
you didn't know it was electric so you just assumed. typical.  the gas   oil used to fuel 2-stroke motors can also be made from carbon negative biomass feedstocks. ...even easier since they aren't considered transport fuels so a larger depot has the capability of distributing them as such.   Your fact is wrong. or myopic, narrow-minded, and way too quick to jump to assumptions.  I'm perfectly calm actually... more just responding to your initial response-tone. kinda annoying when someone starts barking at you right off the bat about shit they clearly have a limited knowledge of.

Cancer isn't the death sentence it use to be  no, but rates of it have climbed from 1 in 10 in '73 when the War on Cancer was announced to 1 in 2 (men) and 1 in 3 (in women) ... with both rising ... and, with repeat cancer diagnoses all but inevitable.  again, why 'cure' something when it can be treated? Cancer is a near- trillion dollar a year industry (not yet, but it soon will be) and growing...   you're commenting on 'they' having control in /r/conspiracy. I think most here would agree that 'they' are up to something :)    national pride (paraphrasing of course)  with a diagnosis rate that's shot up drastically in the past few decades... and with it having done so globally. ..with quality of lives of people... and not just those diagnosed, but all around them... being a major variable here .. ...with costs shooting through the roof (beyond just the cancer itself) ... ...and with mounting death tolls.. ....and, again, it being a *global* 'thing' ... ...I think it's a bit more than a 'game' in a 'stadium'.  but that's just me.  ...and, NASA kicks ass too! just rewatch 'Armageddon' .. you'll see!    working to make the earth a better place for all  speak for yourself ... I, personally, am just looking for stocks worth of investing in because they're going to make me more money. the dying suffering masses can fend for themselves! some people are more 'enlightened'... others still live in trees. one's no more 'evolved' than the other, both are evolved for the environment they choose to live in (more or less). I, personally, am just trying to adapt to the one I currently live in given the set of predetermination evolution has 'given' me.  again, the dying suffering masses can fend for themselves.  (totally joking, btw)
why don't you?  (don't read that as my being snarky... it's a genuine question)
