One of the "missing pieces" in the general debate about what Syriza should or shouldn't do is the matter of 'tax dodging' amongst corporations and wealthy individuals in Greece. From what I understand the prevalence of this in Greece is higher than it is even in Italy. I don't have the references in hand, but my understanding is that Syriza's efforts on this issue have been weak at best. The international bankers and other institutions are quite unconcerned with this aspect of the Greek crisis. One might suspect that tightening up is the *last* thing they would want.

Yes, it can be interesting up to the point of fascinating. Trying to figure out who might have written such a thing and why can be a real head-scratcher. I don't think it's a google translate, at least from any language I am familiar with. I'd go with a stream of consciousness free association, penned for a reason I can't comprehend.
I guess that 99% of the world's scientists, climatologists, geologists, meteorologists, etc. are *on the take* along with the scientific societies and the countries and international organizations that they work for. Conversely the small number of climate change deniers hired by the fossil fuel industry are obviously the very soul of objectivity.  Now, to speak to the specific question of drought in India. The **yet to fully develop** El Nio may have something to do with the temperatures and drought if one holds that the future can determine the present. Even if El Nio *was* fully developed you should consider the analogy of the eight ounce glass. Call El Nio two ounces to be poured in. Without climate change the glass holds 5 ounces. Pour in El Nio and the glass holds the full amount. If, however, with climate change the glass has 7 ounces there's a big mess when you pour in the 2 ounces of El Nio.  Every single weather event always has a number of contributing factors -always. You cannot 'prove', however, that one factor doesn't count just by noting that there are others working as well especially if the others are yet to come.
Double thanks here. One is that you jolted my conscience awake, and reminded me that I should really get around to finishing part 4 of the translation. Another thanks for jolting my memory about your Bakunin library project. Very interesting.  Interesting article by the way. The old 'name dilemma' happens to almost every anarchist who has been active for long periods of time. At some point the disgust with some of the anti-social trends the movement attracts begins to gnaw. Trying to correct public misconceptions about the meaning of the word becomes even more difficult when there are 'comrades' who are overjoyed at promoting the worst labels imaginable and all the labels imply.  'Libertarian socialism' is the most common euphemism, and one I have often used. 'Libertarian communism' in its Spanish or French renderings is probably the most common. Prefixes such as "social" are probably the most popular in English. Implying, of course, that there is such a thing as "anti-social" anarchism which is unfortunately true.
Thanks. I'll try to have a look at that.
I'd imagine that they would be. Earth-based 'cloaking' is already well advanced. My first thought would be that they would establish a small nearby observation post (Mars, the Moon ?) from which they could keep track of things without being detected. If you were to believe 'flying saucer' stories then you have to assume that technological advance doesn't go hand in hand with caution and common sense. Or another hypothesis - they are galactic teases. Of course we shouldn't necessarily assume the usual human motivations to extraterrestrial life. Who knows.
The journal 'Trends in Ecology and Evolution' is published by Cell Press, a branch of Elsevier. Yes, it is a reputable journal. I don't know if I understand your first point correctly, but it seems you are criticizing what is actually the common usage in these sort of papers. People routinely say that a certain trait is selected "for" or "against", and their statements contain the *implied* name of a trait that is the *opposite* of the trait they are speaking of. I know you are probably implying that a 'selectionist' argument for the origin of post-reproduction longevity doesn't necessarily follow from its contradiction of the expectation quoted above.  Now that's true, and the article in fact discusses this along with a number of other open questions surrounding the phenomena of this longevity. It's a *review* article not a report of results from original investigation, and as such it is open ended. It doesn't advance any firm answers. The point you raise is discussed in the context of comparisons of humans to other animals that show post-reproductive longevity *in captivity* but not *in the wild*. It's an interesting point to ponder.
I don't think so. It's hard to quantify this sort of thing. There is opposition to the socioeconomic structure in pretty well all countries all the time. Where do you draw the line and say this or that event/organization/struggle/etc. is active enough to go in say a 'plus column'. Judging this sort of thing can end up very subjective. That being said I would (subjectively) say that 2015 is less 'active' than say 2011 (Occupy, Indignados, Arab Spring), and I think it would be hard to argue otherwise.
That's hardly surprising. Like his fellow fantasy writer C.S. Lewis Tolkien was an 'anglocatholic' with all that implied. All politics aside his loyalty to the Church meant that reports of the early atrocities during the Spanish Revolution impressed him greatly. There's more than one level of irony in this. First of all it was not the 'Communists' who engaged in anti-religious action but rather the anarchists. It was many months before the then miniscule PCE was able to exert any influence other than through their PSOE/PSUC allies. The second irony is that the atrocities were brought to an end in the space of about 2 months... by the anarchists themselves who brought the 'uncontrollable' elements under control. The reports of these events lasted longer than the events themselves. The final irony is that Tolkien' s economic views, basically Catholic 'Distributionism' were closer to anarchism than to any other more popular political trend. History can be, and is, messy.
Thanks for the contribution. I'd be the last to deny that there are 'problems in the house of labor'. To some extent the unions are already reaching out beyond their membership to other unions, social movements and the public at large. There is still a long way to go. The perceived opposition between 'jobs and the environment' as illustrated by your quotation above is a pretty clear example. Union members have to recognize that they aren't just workers but are also members of the community. Reconciling the two 'goods' is a work that is very much in progress.
