Do you know how much it cost to fix a car like that?  And you can't just take it to any old body shop.   That car is wroth millions and if that repair is done incorrectly, it could destroy the value.
Drugs are bad,  mkay.
I played St. Andrews in west chicago the day before and shot an 88. Shot a 103 on Dubsdread...  but it was also 91 degree with 80% humidity and cart path only.  My drives were all off, and I flubbed 6 pitches or chips into the sand.   I want to play again in a few months when it's not so hot.    On a Friday afternoon the pace was great.  4 hour round.  I've heard the weekends drag to 5+, which is unacceptable as far as I care.   The fairways were great, the rough was really long, and the greens were lightning quick.   Is it worth it? All things considered, I'd day yes, on occasion.
As someone who has been responsible for interviewing and hiring recommendations, I can attests to this.  Out of 20 people interviewed for a factory job (basic assembly using hand tools, paying $11 to start), 5 will be black, 5 white, 10 latin, 5 other.  9 out of 10 of the blacks don't show up on time or at all, and then are greatly unqualified (mostly poor attitude).  I blame the "black culture" somewhat, but mostly the education system.   We've let down entire generations which is the cause of this "black culture".  I don't have a solution, just the observations.
Not just whiskey, but GOOD bourbon.
If everyone had your attitude, the range would not be able to keep up with the damage and repair cycle, and the would have to shut down the grass tees to allow them time to repair.   Just hit in one straight line, not that hard.
A turbo set up would of added a grand to the sticker price.  Hell, my ST was the same price as the base model.  If they wanted to make that car fast, they could of.  Instead they made it look fast and spent their money on marketing.  But hey, if you like having a small fasy looking car that isn't fast at all, then good for you!   Just don't cry when I blow your doors off.   And God help you when I start to put upgrades into it.
Similar but different...  There was a guy who was a hole behind us, but he was hitting out of our fairway, buy the green, only 150 yards away.  He was just standing there waiting for his fairway to clear or something, but he was holding us up, which was holding the guys behind us up, which was holding up his fairway...  5 minutes of us standing there yelling atamd signaling the guy, I finally hit into him (over and onto the green), and as we drive up he starts taking shit.  Closest I've ever come to kicking the shit out of someone on the course.   When we pulled up he was like "what the fuck dude?!".  I was actually  polite at first and told him that he was in a group behind us and in our fairway, and to keep the pace of play, should of let us hit first.  His reply was "Fuck you", which is when I lost my cool and said "fuck me?! No, FUCK YOU!  Say one word and you'll catch an ass wooping, and I'll catch a case!"   Which is when he picked up his ball and walked away muttering something.   So,  I know what it's like to lose my cool.  But when ever people hit into me, i just pick up their ball, show it to them, and throw it into the woods, water, or off into the rough.
Nice! I love my ST.
It's ok.  A bit over priced.  My driving range is only 4 blocks from me, and they serve beer and have covered and heated bays.  But if you got a group of friends that aren't that good and want to golf, it's better to go to Top Golf, than a course.
To all the people saying the caddie doesn't matter...  How many tournaments and majors has Tiger won since he broke with his long time caddie?  Do you think Phil would give up his for anyone?
The salt is fully diffused into the water.  No amount of filtering will take the salt out.  It's like trying to filter the sugar out of sugar water.  Isn't going to happen.
And you trying to stop me from passing you isn't putting people's life in danger?  Your putting your own life in danger, idiot.  Go read a newspaper about how many people die in road rage incidents.  Keep up your attitude, and you're going to run into a real asshole, with a gun. Or just someone like me.  When I find people like you, I will pass you, and when I get in front of you, I'm going to slam on my brakes.  I've had people get rear ended, by the next guy that was trying to pass them.  Then I just drive on.  You trying to stop me from saving 5 min, could cost you hours.  Or worse.  Try to consider the mentality of the people you're trying to fuck with.
You can tell yourself that, if it makes you feel better.
Preach brother!  I wouldn't be passing in the right, if the ignorant masses weren't in the left!  I don't cut people off, if I pick the wrong lane and loose a few car lengths, I deal with it and pop into the next hole.  I'll pass the guy taking his time up there eventually.
The Ace?  You mean Mace?  And noooo, the man is a dunce.  Everything in the shows and books point this out.
No, the man is a dunce.
I'd love to see or read that!
I know that, but I've also seen plenty of things that shouldn't work, but do. And things that should work, but don't.  I've worked in retail, management, food/service industry, product design/engineering, and in automotive repair and restoration.  I've seen some shit.
I agree.  My backseat is just an extended trunk.  I've had two single passengers back there, and it's good for them on their own, but if I had 4 people to haul, unless they were 10 or younger, I'd tell them to take a different car.   I love my ST, but I see it as a two adult, and a couple of kids, car.  Not 5 adults.
You shut your dirty mouth, with that jumped the shark nonsense!
Photoshop or perspective?
Be more confident, pick up on the signs from the girls, and have sex with them all.
You evil bastard.
Fuck you. That is all.
Robin.  Sorry.

So, what about people that aren't homeless or in prison?  Is there a genetic predisposition to being gay, but there needs to be the triggers in your life?  Similar to people that suffer from addiction?  I've always figured everything in life is a mix of nurture AND nature.
Police don't just show up and start harassing people.  Something had to draw their attention to said person. If that person then was polite, respectful, and didn't question authority and act like they know the law/their rights, then unless you are breaking the law, the cop will go away.   I've always been polite and respectful, and i always walk away.  My friends tend to mouth off and make sudden movements, and end up in jail.   Is it right?  Fuck no.  Fuck the police, their agenda, and their corporate masters.  But, i like my "freedom", so when i see a cop, i do my best to be John Q. Public Taxpayer,  and i suggest you do the same.
I wouldn't know.  I missed it, for a reason.
I don't know what you did, but I assume you drive like an idiot.  I'd have to be furious to throw food.
I'm not sold on the fiesta.  There is a rather large selection of after market performance upgrades for the focus st and several message boards dedicated to enthusiasts.
