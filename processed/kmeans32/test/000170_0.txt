yes
Yeah I asked him.  I also asked him about Corvo's personality as well. He said he's passionate but private, guarded, analytical equally prone to long periods of caution and study. The kind of man who loves only once. I also asked him what he and the Empress did in their spare time, just look on his replies. I am NathanLabesius as well as DamienLee. I made two accounts so he wouldn't get sick of one user asking him questions all the time.   His twitter is like a constant AMA.
The Revenant (for me) is a must watch  Sicario. Denis Villenueve's new film. Along with Deakins shooting, you can't go wrong.  Star Wars. Duh.  Hateful Eight. Tarantino's new movie gotta see it.   Steve Jobs. Bound to win some oscars.  Spectre. Skyfall was fucking spectacular, hope this tops it.  Ant-Man. I'll give it a shot.  Southpaw. Love Jake Gyllenhaal.  MI5: Rogue Nation. Looks awesome, loved the 4th one.  I've probably missed heaps but those are my main ones.
It.
That is actually quite a nice poster. Better than half the other poorly photo-shopped shit.
As you can all see I am no writer. Within the DCCU, we have Batman v Superman, Suicide Squad and Justice League Parts 1   2 all staring Ben Affleck as Batman. DC have also announced that they are making a single stand alone Batman film JUST about Batman (obviously there will be supporting characters within) whereas Suicide Squad, Justice League and BvS are all feature Affleck's Batman as a supporting character.  In this discussion I just wanted to ask everyone what they would like to see in this stand alone Batman film, what villains they would like to see etc.
Brilliance.
Let's get this subreddit up and running!   Lets see if we can get bigger than /r/Fighclub, I'm talking making a title page banner, weekly discussions about shit etc COME ON
Skip to 4:08, you'll get what I'm talking about then.
We all float down here...
That is hilarious.
I feel the EXACT the same way you do. I have a similar first experience with this song. I was in Germany with my family visiting my grandparents, I remember getting Love of Gold for my 10th birthday (Yes, I was way a head of my age with music, books and film; I still am)  and I remember waking up at exactly 7:00 in the morning and walking into the out onto the front porch  with the CD. It was beautiful outside, the sun was rising and the snow was gently melting off the grass and trees; it was beautiful. I remember sitting down and putting the CD in the player they had on the porch. For the whole 14 minutes I was blown away, just sitting on the porch to my grandparents house, looking out across the grass and forest. I'll never forget that day, after that I would listen to the song every morning. It is unarguably one of the best songs ever written and performed. Words can't even describe it.
A disguised Ben Affleck on set of 'Suicide Squad'
This should be pretty good. I hope so.
I want to become a cinematographer?   Where is a good place on the net to start learning about the basics? Things like the different types of cameras, lenses, cameras in general and just the technical part of cinematographer, if someone could link me to a website, video etc that covers the basics of these topics, I would much appreciate it!  Also, does anyone know of any REALLY good books/essays on cinematography that would help a beginner like me?  And finally, does anyone know of any cinematography analysis videos/ essays? Anything that analyzes famous scenes or shots from films, or just analyzing someones work in general.  Thanks in advance!!
Yeah true. When the new 'It' remake comes out, I think it'll be very very good. It might have what your looking for, as it is about friendship and growing up, just with an evil ass demonic alien in there somewhere. (The book) is a beautiful coming of age story, I highly recommend it. But yeah the movie when it comes out will be just what you're looking for if it's good, which I'm sure it will be. (I mean come on, the remake is written and will be directed by the same guy who did True Detective!)
I love it. I love Finchers style, so smooth and subtle and not over the top. I love the twisted eerie soundtracks that he uses in his films, I also love his under-lit environments. He'll do over a hundred takes of a scene just to get it right, I think people need to appreciate that. Apparently the other 2 are still going to happen, which makes me very happy. If you liked this then definitely check out his other films, especially Zodiac.
Hahaha
O.O  *sigh* Now I need to watch it again..
Haha, I was in the shop just looking for the normal bluray for Howls moving castle when I look towards the end of the isle and I see a stand with that edition sitting on it. I just stared at it for 30 seconds straight. Then, as plain as a robot, I put the normal bluray back onto the shelf, walked towards the 10th anniversary edition, picked it up bought it, and marched out of the shop. My face was as blank as paper.
Sorry, but what goes on here? Can someone please explain!
What the actual fuck.
Maybe I'm over-reacting a bit, and I normally take documentaries with a grain of sand, but this just really got to me. I just cannot believe what these bastards have gotten away with and how they treat their people. How they practically used people, such as Tom Cruise, to gain power and superiority. Also, how they basically destroyed his marriage to Nicole Kidman. Don't even get me started on that bastard Miscavige....  Like I said, how true can all this be? It seems pretty legit to me. I just wanted to see if anyone else feels the same way :)
Tomorrowland Official International Trailer #1 (2015)
His upcoming film the revenant, may just be it. I don't see any oscar caliber perfomances in the months to come, but what can I say? I haven't seen all the films this year but the only oscar territory perfomances I can see coming up so far are Michael Fassbender as Steve Jobs and Leo as Hugh Glass in 'The Revenant' (did you see the image they release of him!? JESUS he looks intense)
It's my favorite book, and it will be co-written and directed by the guy directed one of my favorite tv shows (True Detective) so I am hoping this turns out good.  Here's a few links:  http://screencrush.com/cary-fukunaga-it-very-scary/  http://screenrant.com/stephen-king-it-movies-2015-2016-director/
Yeah this has been questioned over and scrutinized for years. I don't actually know, I think it's just an easter egg.
Thank you!
I don't see why you were downvoted for that, you made a very solid point. Upvoted :)
If you judge the movie purely as a movie, It is very well made. I haven't seen anyone HATE on it, of course like any war movie it will cause some controversy (remember when The Hurt Locker came out?). But I really don't really care about the controversy, because I always remember this: It's just a movie!!!!  (Please don't downvote, It's just an opinion)
Maybe not
