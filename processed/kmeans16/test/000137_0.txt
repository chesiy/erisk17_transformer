I feel like I've read this before.   Also as someone who works sales, I recommend you tell customers of the place to ask the place to put their menu online. Stores are always apprehensive about new things and since you're presenting them with this idea or tool, even if it's completely free, they feel you have something to gain from it that they're missing out on.  If enough customers or sometimes even just one regular customer requests it, that puts the power in their hands to do it because the customers are wanting it. I've had stores order things I didn't have any intention of selling to them because it wasn't something that did well but a customer wanted it so they ordered it
Yeah I literally saw nothing until I saw a comment mentioning how this post was the only thing in /r/all that wasn't about fph being banned. I had no idea what fph was so I went to /r/all and made the swift decision to never go there again because it is a silly place
Thanks a lot I'll look into that
I use always on status because I use a controller and thus cannot hover over anything with my mouse.   In addition to that, I have a mod called additional structures. It adds some bigger and metal chests that I feel fit the balance of the game well. I also have craft able tunnels which I have yet to use.   I would say anything that is cheating would be stuff that increases your stack sizes, or something that adds a backpack slot. I know that I should be able to wear a damn backpack with a coat but that's not how the game was designed/balanced.
Yeah I don't have the expansion so I just have the two seasons. I didn't know that until halfway through my winter in my current game. I was running around in a panic trying to figure out what I need to do and gather so I can be ready for the hot summer because of all the things I saw on the wiki and what I read here.
I subscribe to /r/games and obviously this sub. I directly subscribe to specific game subreddits that I'm interested in. Other than that, I listen to the GiantBomb Podcast while driving. I drive about 10 hours per week for work and luckily my work Truck has an Aux port for the stereo so I've taken to listen to a bunch of podcasts. It's nice to not have to take the time outside of work to catch up on the rest of the world by listening to podcasts, otherwise I'd be stuck listening to all the same songs the radio let's me listen to
I still feel like his videos are different nowadays. I started watching him right when he got around a million subscribers and I loved his content and everything felt genuine. Lately though, I can't watch any of his videos as they almost feel forced. I'm sure he's still having fun but it seems like his videos have all devolved into forced random obscenities
I was the sauce and soup guy, I frequently had nightmares about not having the ingredients I needed to get through the day because it happened often enough and the response from management was always shitty: I felt like I was bothering them with my shitty problem and most of the time they were apathetic about resolving it quickly. It would put me behind on my prep, and Lo and behold the first customer that walks in the door when we open wants a dish that requires the sauce I don't have and then the line is freaking out and then my managers freak out even though I told them I can't make it. One time we ran out of heavy cream and I couldn't make fucking Alfredo and I didn't even get the cream until a half hour after we opened
If any of you have seen my posts before, my original M8 has a cracked camera lens so I did the advanced exchange program. My first replacement (left) was distinctly not as bright and had a yellow hue so I called customer service and they sent another one (right) which is a little closer to my original. I don't want to do the song and dance of having to send in phone after phone after phone until I get one that looks "right" to me so I'm accepting the second replacement. I suppose after a day of use I won't even notice when I don't have a control to compare it against.  At one point I had all three phones so I had to take this picture because really, how often does a guy get to temporarily possess three HTC One M8's?. To compare the brightess I used a fast shutter speed and darkened the picture further
I just don't know how it can be programmed for so many variables like that. Just in my small town, there is parallel parking downtown, and some side streets have diagonal parking along the street. Then there are limitations on how far away from a corner you can be, or you can't Park in front of a fire hydrant, or there could be an alley access. Unless there is a universal parking method everywhere, I can't see the possibility of taking the human out of the equation.
Thanks for the explanation. I didn't actually play the second game, just watched most of my wife's playthrough. Either way I'm not happy they ruined him
I thought this was familiar. I expected to see the video was posted in 2013 but much to my surprise it's new

I just wanted to share my moment of clarity I had the other day with everyone.   It's 4 in the afternoon, it's sunny out, I'm wearing a baseball cap, I have facial hair, and I'm driving down the interstate blasting AC/DC Shoot to Thrill. Everything is as it should be.   I work for a beverage vendor so I don't drive as much as you guys do here but I do the out of town route so I drive more than anyone else in the sales center but it's still only about 2 hours total per day. But when I do get to be on the road, I love it.
This fucker right here
[Request] Unintentional unboxing videos that trigger asmr?   For me, intentional asmr videos just make me feel weird. I like it when it just happens. A lot of the time it's in unboxing videos, I don't know why. I just came across an "unboxing" video posted on this subreddit and I figured I'd ask if anyone knows of any good unintentional ones because the intentional stuff like tapping on the box for 3 minutes straight just annoyed the hell out of me
