THANK YOU! I just made a post like this and I hope people read it and pay attention to it. The game in its current state is atrocious - almost as bad as the beginnings of rs3. I've been involved in the RuneScape community for a long time, and even had an account on RuneScape Classic. I didn't want to part with my almost maxed rs3 account, but I just couldn't stand for the new rs3; it just wasn't satisfying anymore. 2007Scape is also taking a tumble for the worst. This is leaving me thinking: Is it really time to just move on and forget about the game?
Necessity.  I'm a college student and worked as an RA for a year (shh don't tell my supervisor) and had little money left over after purchasing my little supply. I also didn't want to be going around with a piece and obviously couldn't smoke indoors. I opted to going with the blunt/joint route. It's cheap, simple, and when you finish your sesh you don't have any incriminating paraphernalia on your person. Albeit rolling is much harder than packing a bowl, but I learned to roll well in only a little while. I suggest starting out with blunts or wraps as I feel they are easier to roll than papers - but it's certainly a personal preference.   Definitely a good stoner-skill to know!
Whatever you like. I've been listening to a lot of Trevor Hall recently. Really chill and relaxing.
The first couple times I smoked nothing happened; it became frustrating for me. I wanted to know what being high was like. I then started to get high and understood what it was like.   Just be careful when you first start out. You may see that people smoke more than you. Don't worry, that's okay; it isn't a contest. Being *too* high is a thing and it isn't good if you're first starting out. I also suggest doing it somewhere safe around good company (or alone. There's nothing wrong with smoking alone). Just enjoy yourself. Welcome to the community and happy toking!

I used to have an m80 with a plume veil RDA, but I sold it to a friend and now I have an ABS dual 18650 box mod with a Royal Hunter. I like it quite a bit, actually.
Buy a good sharpstone. Mine was $50, it's anodized, and it's on the bigger side ( I think 2.5-3"). I've had it for over a year and I use it very frequently. It's the only grinder my buddies and I use so it gets plenty of use. It feels nice in the hand, is very smooth when griding, and I definitely recommend it.

Handcheck on this rainy day!
What's wrong with the m80?
If I took took it to my bike shop how much would you say that would cost?
My very first purchase!
215!
I loved that hike. I did it twice in a day
That actually scared me
I'm sorry you had to depart with your chin - that's a shame. But yes, they are extremely sociable and smart little creatures. I let mine run around an hor or two a day and give him plenty of chew toys. He seems to be happy. I've only had him for a couple months.
