My local fish monger does a great job. Since  I'm not on the west coast I'm pretty sure that it was flash frozen at one point, but I'm not sure.
I'm not planning to upgrade the portrait lens at this point. The results from that, little inexpensive lens are astounding.  Really I'm looking for a telephoto lens and potentially a wide angle.

In Canada that would be $30,000.
If reducing clearance is the goal, then you shouldn't be using single wall pipe.  Double wall stove pipe only requires 6" clearance, allowing you to put the stove as close to the wall as you want without requiring an additional shield.  OP's wall looks great, but most heat shields are a black piece of tin on the wall. Most installations look much nicer without a shield.

As a sales professional I disagree. My job Is to direct you towards the best product for you personally. That's the product that will give you the most happiness for a price you can afford. If sales is done properly, everyone wins. You leave happy with your purchase and I earn commission. People who inflate prices artificially or lie about the performance of a product hurt the rep sales professionals everywhere.   I don't have to lie to you about a product. I just have to tell you that the one with the features you want is more expensive. You buy it or you don't. That's on you.   Lying about the amount money Jobs brought in wasn't a dirty salesman tactic. It was straight up theft.  It came right out of Woz's pocket.
Any suggestion for cold or frozen cables?  They seem impossible to coil properly.
I completely forgot that I recently joined this sub. This is amazing.
I smoked for about 12 years, smoking a pack a day at the end. I quit the day that my wife moved in. She wasn't going to put up with any shit and that made the decision to quit easy. There was no hiding it because she was living with me, and the temptation faded slowly. I still get the rare craving, but it's only for a minute and then it's gone.
I'm 32 and I never thought that I would wind up working with my dad, but here we are.  I'm now one of the partners in the business and doing very well. Sometimes following the family business can work to your advantage, but don't expect it to fall into your lap. As the son of the boss I have to work twice as hard as others but I'm also the best at my job and most likely to take over. Surprisingly, I really enjoy my work and my dad and I work well together.  I also never could have imagined getting married and having kids, especially since I was never really outgoing. It's highly recommended; best thing I ever did.
Thanks for the reply!

It's not cancer, spiders or an abscessed tooth.  According to the dentist, the nerve on one of my molars died and then became infected.  So, the guy who said "blood and puss" is today's winner.  The only reason it ever got to this point is because I'm a Canadian that was traveling in the U.S. and couldn't see a dentist until I got home.  Thanks for your concern everyone, I'm on antibiotics and was even prescribed percocet for the pain so I'm high as a kite.
