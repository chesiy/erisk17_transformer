Not saying the Vikings had a solid defense in that game. But an offense without Peterson and with Ponder sucks. It's inefficient (time of possession) and has turnovers. That makes success for the defense incredibly difficult.
I'll live with the post karma trumping my comment karma in this case. People disagree with me. I can live with that

If you still are feeling the itch, there is also the Dunk and Egg novellas as well as The Princess and the Queen. All in the Westeros world. Fantastic reads.
Watch "All-Clucking Version of Fun.'s "Some Nights" (Jimmy Fallon, Amy Poehler   Michael Buble)"
That's what they get for ruining Bo Jackson.

Yeah.  Well did.  That was in 2008.  In Professor Chu's World War I History class.  He was one of the TA's.  I imagine he is no longer there as a TA now...just doin' Jesus' Pen Work.
Definitely agree with you here.  I hate Milwaukee in winter. But I have traveled to a lot of places in the world and Milwaukee in summer is somehow still near the top of my favorite cities somehow.

Where you are from is a major part of what shapes you as person.  I like America man, and I am proud of that.  I am not necessarily proud of some of the decisions our country has made and especially not proud of our healthcare system in particular.  But I know a lot of great people who would bend over backwards for just about anyone.  These aren't the people that everyone hears about, so it is a shame that the gun-toting obnoxious assholes are all people ever do hear about.  I am proud of the people around me that I saw (don't currently live in America -ironic for me to be defending it and then not living there, I know) who are great people and hardworking and are trying to help our country change for the better. I.E. protests around wall street.
