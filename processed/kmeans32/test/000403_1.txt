Just browsing r/all on mobile, haven't looked at this sub any further; I will tonight though
I was there last year too, spent 2 weeks in a hospital. Unfortunately I hadn't started smoking regularly yet so I can't imagine how great that first hit must have felt... keep your chin up! I'm always here if you need someone to talk to or anything Like that :)
My friend's cat just had 6 of these cuties
Pete Wentz?
Mamrie Hart !!!
She's also just made a movie, which came out yesterday called Camp Takota :)
Self respect isnt about rather or not you show your breasts, its about being comfortable with your choices. If you want to pose topless, thats okay. If you dont, thats okay too. Whats not okay is saying youre better than someone else because you choose one way and they chose another. Telling women that they should be ashamed for choosing something that doesnt hurt them or others (and by hurt them, I mean like choosing to do drugs or something like that), you are contributing to the patriarchy and oppression

Alright bring on the downvotes, I'm just so fucking tired of people believing everything they see or hear on the Internet. He wasn't 2 hours late, it was 40 minutes. He didn't "insist on playing video games" when he woke up either. And even if he did, he's fucking human for fucks sake. I'm tired of seeing everything this guy does on here, if I wanted 24/7 Bieber coverage I'd join twitter. Get your fucking facts straight and stop posting about Bieber.
