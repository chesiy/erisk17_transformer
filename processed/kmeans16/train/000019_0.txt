I used to be and still sort of am one of those people you puzzle about. I really don't care about 30,000 deaths a year since that is still a small enough number that it couldn't put us at risk for extinction and I see it as sort of a good thing. I see it as sort of a good thing because that is 30,000 less people around to pollute, use resources, and reproduce to contribute to overpopulation. It also takes some strain off of Medicare and Social Security because most of those who die in the accidents die before 65. Basically, I see cars and motorcycles as "population control/natural selection machines", but that isn't a good enough reason to be against a new technology. I still do not really care about deaths from things like cars for these reasons and value freedom over lives and safety, but my view on autonomous cars is now neutral. If you want an autonomous car when they are available because you feel that is the better choice, so be it, but that doesn't mean I think we should ban manual cars from the roads. Maybe make licensing requirements and penalties for drunk or reckless driving stricter and make autonomous rental cars or cabs more readily available to those who don't have them but are in a situation where they shouldn't be driving though.

The scary thing is that she looks so normal.  Edit: she looks like someone who would post on /r/awwschwitz.

Pretty much all the late 70s-80s large American cars (e.g. Chevy Caprice, Ford LTD, Dodge Diplomat) were still common 5-10 years ago depending on where you went, but now they are becoming a rare sight.
Why does it seem like whenever someone admits to bad driving on reddit, they are either given a lot of sympathy, or heavily flamed and downvoted, with nowhere in between?   These posts are kind of old, but are still good examples of what I mean. Both did something pretty dangerous, and likely not for the first time, but the difference in how in one there is a lot of flaming and in the other one the commenters take on the attitude of "Sorry you messed up, good thing your car looks nice again" seems interesting to me.  [Given sympathy](http://www.reddit.com/r/mercedes_benz/comments/2ygnl6/texting_and_driving_on_my_w211_never_again/)  [Flamed and downvoted](http://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/2vo6nb/hi_my_name_is_luvs2speed_and_im_a_speedaholic/)
The problem isn't that it's a bad car, the problem is that by not marketing it properly, making it too expensive, and not making a manual available, they have screwed up it's potential at being a popular car. I have only ever seen one in person.
I saw it happen yesterday. This random girl (not a hooker either) got angry and randomly started shooting at cops. Should have taken a screenshot. After she killed the cops, I was able to take the police car without acquiring a wanted level.
70s-80s RWD,boxy, full-size American cars. (E.g. Caprice Classic, LTD Crown Victoria, Chrysler Fifth Avenue). Most enthusiasts disregard these cars as bland and stodgy, but I actually think they should be looked at on the same level as W123s and Volvo 240s. Just like those European cars, these cars are also boxy, conservative, slow, un-sporty, and simple to work on. I like the earlier oversized versions too, but these seem to be more notably made fun of.
Most recently, a hooded figure in the corner of a hotel room during sleep paralysis. I also sometimes see ones of different shapes and sizes, walking slowly, occasionally with faint red eyes in the dark of night while awake, though more often when I was a child. One I remember well at age 7 or 8 appeared to have the shape of a large man with a small head I saw while I was living at my granddads house. Seeing them as a kid was terrifying, though they left me alone and stayed on the other side of the room. Seeing them today isn't as scary but still unsettling.
- Ford Panther Platform - In particular, the Mercury Marauder with its GNX style blacked out trim, and the few Crown Victoria Police Interceptors that haven't been beaten into the ground by then. - Pontiac G8 GXP - The best of the last - Cadillac STS-V, CTS-V, and Escalade - Cadillac got to be cool again. - AMG Benzes - Depreciation is a bitch. A W220 S55 will give you supercar performance on a used minivan budget, so if you are expecting these cars to appreciate in price someday, pick em' up now. - BMW M3, M5, M Coupe - Same as above. The M Coupe was an oddball too. - Mercedes R-Class - This is a wild card. Not that sporty, sexy, or cool in any kind of way, but sold in very small numbers and is destined to be forgotten. Less than 100 AMG models were produced too. Could go down in history as a "Mercedes Edsel" of sorts.

In some parts of the world, it must still be quite common. I've  traveled to the Bahamian island of Exuma, where the most common surnames belong to many, many residents and can be seen everywhere, on storefronts, in the local newspapers, and on the nametags of waiters.
