Well the thing is I don't know. I know some animals will reject their young if you touch them. I have also heard it's also generally bad to touch fish because you have oil on their scales and you can damage them. I also once handled a little Australian ring tailed possum after I tried to save it from a cat and I covered it with a towel and put it in a box. It physically was fine, with no cuts or anything but then it bit me and a couple of seconds later it died. I was told later that they have weak hearts and sometimes they can die like that.   Anyway I'm no veterinarian so I can't give a good answer but I think some animals have a higher tolerance for human interaction than others.
I'm in Sydney. How is life here treating you?
I used to work at a Federal Government agency and quite a few people moved from interstate (all over the country) to work in Sydney.  They all used a rental property service. This was paid for by the government agency. If you can get your work or your partner's work to pay for it that would be ideal, but if not I think the service is worth the money.   I'm sure there are a few around but just do a Google search for it. http://www.sydneyrentalsearch.com.au/  I'd highly recommend it.
Leichhardt used to be renowned for their slow development approvals. Then the NSW government stepped in and took approval rights away from them and [approved this]( http://m.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/inner-west/controversial-leichhardt-development-given-green-light-despite-community-outcry/story-fngr8h4f-1226847080770).   I agree with keeping some heritage buildings though. Would you really want to just rip it all up? There are cases when they've done this in the UK and it has culturally ruined areas that were vibrant and turned them into places where people don't want to live.
Aw thanks! :) So much reddit love.
The thing I'm looking forward to is walking down George Street and it actually being a pleasant place to be, rather than having to get off the main street as quickly as possible and yelling to talk to your friends, because you have to compete with the bus noise.   I get the bus most days and would be okay to get light rail (I used to get the light rail sometimes), except I hope they don't put those shitty old carriages on the new light rail. They really suck, and give me motion sickness. The old carriages are so much better.
Honestly if it's in my direct path, I just pick it up and put it in the bin myself. I don't really care about getting my hands dirty. If it's really gross I have a pack of wet ones in my bag.   I was standing at a bus stop and there was a newspaper from the local grocers flapping around all over the pavement. It was driving me nuts because it was about to blow everywhere. I just picked all the pieces up and put it in the bin, while the other 10+ people just stood there and let me do it. Maybe I'm a crazy old woman now or something but argh. I have nothing else to do but wait for the bus.
My dad was the only person to give me a good response to saying I didn't want kids.   He said... "It's up to you if you want to have kids or don't want to. There are pros and cons to both. If I didn't have kids I could have done other things that I didn't do because I had them. "   He did add at the end "But if you do want them, it's best to do it before 35." But that's the doctor in him talking.   Anyway, I don't know but that was one of the best conversations we've ever had. It just felt like a weight had been lifted from me.
This makes me feel as if the person who wrote this quote has never done anything worthwhile in their life.
If you're lucky you can see them in the city.   For the longest time I thought someone was using a clothes dryer at night... and it always puzzled me why at that hour they would do their laundry. It turns out it was a tawny frogmouth. They make a weird continuous hoot. After hearing this sound for over 5 years I finally saw them a couple of months ago. I saw 3 in the space of about two weeks. So cool. They hang by the creek.   Although tawny frogmouths aren't technically owls, they're nightjars so I suppose I haven't really seen an owl.  But yeah if you want to see them, you'll have to listen carefully. When you're close they are very quiet and difficult to spot unless they fly in front of you. But it happens! At least you will know from listening if they are in your area.
I've been looking for 2 years. Whatever the price guide is we usually add $200-300k and it ends up closer to what it will actually go for. It helps reduce our disappointment a bit at auction. But it's still crap. Every time we figure out what the price should be it defies our expectations the next month. It's horribly disheartening and makes me lose faith.
Oh yeah whoops. I didn't notice the time :)
I don't know if you've heard of him - David Ireland, Wildlife Man - but he always loves to pick animals up that don't want to be picked up and while he's talking he flails them about in the air.    He did this with a Shingleback and it was so angry at him. When he put it down it didn't really try to run away it just looked at him like it was evaluating it's options on how exactly it was going to take his life. I tried to find the video on youtube but I can't find it. :(
That particular Kirin one is pretty yummy! I had half of one today too at lunch with my sushi.    Mango Raspberry sounds good too. I am going to get that now next time I'm at the shop.
A year or so ago I told my friend who is a psychologist about how I see someone, and I said that it's good cause I have someone to talk to. I explained I don't talk to my friends about it cause I don't want to burden them with it. She said plainly that she thinks that sometimes you should talk to your friends about things. It was the first time anyone had said that to me and it was one of the nicest things anyone has ever said to me.   It's just so hard because I had it bad in highschool and always talked about suicide. My best friend from highschool also suffered from depression and last year she committed suicide, and I feel so responsible for talking about it all the time, and I feel like I didn't help and only made it worse for her.   I still can't talk to friends openly about it. Sometimes I feel so alone.
I know I'm just some random person on the Internet but please don't give up. People do shitty things because they're imperfect, not because you do or don't deserve it. I know what it's like to care about someone and get shat on. It's terrible, gut wrenching and soul destroying. But you're still important and I hope you will give the world another chance. I hope you will get through tonight, then tomorrow, then the next night. And I hope sometime you will see that your life is worth it.
I guess it must be easier to clean. I see them all the time nowadays.  I'm not really a fan though. The water does drain toward the wall but I find it doesn't really stay contained. I also like shaking my hands in the bowl of the sink and it's hard when the sink has no sides.
I am one of those people that overanalyses my day to day life and I always feel like this. Sometimes it helps if I lay in bed and think about where I am right now and analyse just the present. It gives me a short reprieve from everything outside of my room and I am just in this moment right now. Maybe you can try it.  Like right now I am typing on an iPad on my bed and the air conditioning is on which I am glad for because i hate feeling sweaty when I'm about to sleep. I'm a little tired and have a headache but I'm glad the day is over. I'm not going to think about tomorrow... Just the next 5 minutes and I'm focused on this message and thinking about how when I sleep my mind will shut down for just a few hours and me and it will have our daily short but very necessary holiday away from each other.
I spent 6.5 years at Sydney Uni so ask me anything. But I'm Australian so don't know what it's like as an American. Though my supervisor was from the US so always told me about it.   1) assuming you're coming as an undergraduate: not that many Aussies live on campus. Most commute at least for their first year. Otherwise it should be pretty similar to the US.  2) This is unlikely to be a problem. Sydney Uni is fairly diverse.   3) Depends what you're after and what experience if any you have. If you have an RSA you can try bar work. If you have done some prior study you can do tutoring. You can do babysitting.  The Uni has a casual and part time job portal: http://sydney.edu.au/careers/finding_jobs/casual.shtml You might need to be enrolled to log in.
Have pity on us who live next to dogs like that the rest of the year. Just kill me...  Oh and you report problem dogs to council.
No problem at all! I'm glad you heard my words and that I could brighten your day. :)
I ate maccas everyday for 6 months cause I was working full time and studying and didn't have time for a lunch break. It was so convenient to drive through and eat at traffic lights. I got pretty sick :(  Recently I hadn't had maccas in months and then I got it the other day and sat next to a really stinky homeless guy. Now I associate maccas with smelly people and I don't crave it. KFC is so much better :) Luckily it's not convenient for me.
Before you leave work each day write a list of things you need to do the next day. This lets you leave work at work and stop wasting time when you get to work in the morning.

:) I really really want one. I live in a small apartment but hopefully I can move out soon into a house and get one. We also had a cat we got at the same time and they were best friends. My cat used to curl up in the dog's fur and sleep. I have a better photo somewhere - I can't find it at the moment - but I love this one of them playing together: http://i.imgur.com/EG6J8.jpg. ...though my cat doesn't really look too happy about this game hehe.

Depends if you want to go on a weekday or weekend and what time, and I don't know your price range but I just thought of a couple of places I've been off the top of my head you could look up in the cbd:  * Max Brenners near Wynyard station * GPO cafe (not sure of the name) - There's 2 inside * La Guillotine behind Town Hall (actually a restaurant) * Lime Cafe * Boy Charlton Poolside Cafe (http://www.poolsidecafe.com.au/cafe/home/) - good on a nice day  Also try this link for more: http://www.citycafes.com.au/Sydney_cafes

I don't think anyone actually records those types of statistics.   Also, I was providing statistics relevant to car insurance, so I think this is relevant for that purpose.  I am not really saying women are better drivers than men, only that they are involved in different types of accidents.
It sounds like you have a lot of really good advice to share, so I thought I would ask a question. It's a bit detailed, but I would greatly appreciate any advice on how to deal with my managers.  I have been working at a large government organisation for 18 months and am quite junior.  Although I'm technical I can see a major problem with the organisation (it is primarily a business issue but has ramifications for IT), and I previously raised it with the 2nd in charge (sort of like COO). I regret that I didn't have a solution at the time, as he asked me what I suggest we need to do. I told him that I would need some time to think and reasearch a solution. After I explained that I may offend my managers for raising it directly with him and not my immediate manager, he said he would send an email inviting me to sit with him and with the head of IT to discuss my ideas.   After this meeting I told my manager that the 2nd in charge would like to discuss my ideas, and he said I needed to present to him first. I saw that as a good thing as it was a chance to get some valuable feedback.  However, since then I've moved to another manager in the IT department, and this manager would also like me to present to him first, and then if he approves I can present to my senior manager. After presenting to the senior manager, if he approves then I will be able to present to the head of IT and all the other senior managers. If they are all okay with it, then I will be able to meet with the 2nd in charge to discuss my idea.   I believe this process is going to take a few months and it is quite frustrating, as this is just an idea (and hasn't been approved by anyone yet, and is primarily a business idea), and also the 2nd in charge has asked me to go see him.  I don't know what to do in this sort of situation. I know I can go directly to the 2nd in charge and say that I am still very keen but I have been asked to present to others first before I can talk to him, but I know that will annoy a lot of people. I have spoken to my manager to explain that it wasn't really necessary to present to all senior managers first before going to the 2nd in charge as it was more of a business issue. He couldn't give me a good reason why I had to and in the end said he would talk to the head of IT to see if we can just present to him.   I just feel that they are putting up roadblocks for me and I am not doing this for me but because I really honestly believe that the organisation will benefit from this (and I have attended senior business meetings where they have raised issues relating to this problem that affect the work). The main reason that I think they are doing it is because it will probably create more work for the IT department, but I believe that if the business thinks it is important then that is up to them to decide and not IT.  I would just like to know what you think is the right thing to do in this sort of situation?
