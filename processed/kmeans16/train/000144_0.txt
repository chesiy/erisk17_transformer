Well shit, there you go, now I see it.  Thanks!
IMO, they're essentially treating some of their inventory as loss leaders, buying feedback if you will, trying to get that power seller status so people keep coming back, new people come in with confidence they won't get hosed.  I would imagine they'll be raising prices in the future.  Not all of their inventory is a deal, as well...They have a kilo Koala for $598, both APMEX and Provident are around $30 cheaper, I think it was when I compared.  I've had a good purchase through them, though their shipping is slow if you're on the west coast.  Didn't get tracking until the 3rd biz day after the buy-it-now.  UPS Ground is 5 days coast-to-coast, so 8 day shipping for me.

You should make a screencast of the process from start to finish and put it on youtube. Have a "real'ish" type of project to publish, use a good youtube title and tags. For example, your thread title here isn't that great, I had no idea what the contents would be. If it was "Surge - Static Web Publishing for Front-End Developers" well, that tells me a bunch.  I search youtube quite often for front-end related stuff, I personally love video demos to discover stuff.
*I* wouldn't do one, but that's *my* personal choice based on the resources I have available for them to make a determination.  They want me to spend time (some times a lot), but they won't spend time (I'm talking 10-15 minutes) to look through my github and ask just one *thoughtful* question.    They can ask anything they want but I don't have to jump through their hoops as there are plenty of jobs out there.  Bottom line is if you have options, you exercise them.
Been thinking of getting a tube of these, hopefully spot will keep dropping.  If anyone is also interested, they're an [exclusive at Bullion Exchanges](http://bullionexchanges.com/buy-silver/2015-1-oz-silver-canadian-maple-leaf-e-mc2-privy-reverse-proof-5-coin.html) and they're on some sort of deal now, with 20 hours left on the deal.
They're either injecting malware into your computer or they're using a popular scrolling javascript library.  For the latter, here's some I can immediately think of:  * superscrollorama * scrollmagic * wow.js  Just google those and check them out.  You'll probably want to reformat your hard drive first, get rid of that virus you and I have now.
Well, shit, don't know what the problem is on this end...I'll give it a whirl at home.
In theory, the benefits of everything that comes with either of those frameworks (MVC/structure, two-way data binding, SPA/routing, testing, documentation, etc).  I'm pretty adamant that right now is just the wrong time for us to do a new app in Angular given what we have to support.
But [a lot of the jobs suck](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/28/business/economy/recovery-has-created-far-more-low-wage-jobs-than-better-paid-ones.html) and wages aren't growing.  Also, [labor participation rate is lowest since 1978](http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS11300000/) (change the from date up top to 1970).  Sure, you have a growing aging population, but I'm sure a lot of people are just giving up.  Do you really believe the [official unemployment numbers?](http://www.forbes.com/sites/louisefron/2014/08/20/tackling-the-real-unemployment-rate-12-6/)
I started my new Job as a Junior Web Developer this Monday, and so far its pretty good  It's only Thursday, bro.  The dilemma I have right now, is they program in many different languages with many different frameworks so there isnt a set in stone one to learn  Yep, jack of all trades, master of none.  My issue right now, is what I finished work I go home and have to do further programming to improve my Javascript skills, which does quite interfere with my social life  Yep.  meaning I do drift further away from friends  JavaScript is your only friend now.  as we often connect through playing Games together and skype, which I dont really have the time for now.      if (life !== fair) {         tears = true;         tears.fall();         delete fun;     }  I am wondering how you balance your time, while learning new skills/starting new jobs  It all depends on the life you want. Do you want to make good $ and never have a problem getting a job?  Then get used to this because it takes a lot of work to remain relevant, especially when working on the front-end.  It's literally a part time job just trying to keep up.  The Role is mainly front end based for now, but they are keen to get my trained up in back end.  Of course they are.
*The Road* is a movie about total collapse of society, scavenging to survive, real "SHTF" mentality that does exists in the PM community. There's a certain amount of cross pollination between stackers and preppers, where you'll hear about SHTF, TEOTWAWKI (Shit Hits The Fan/The End Of The World As We Know It respectively).  A bit nutty, IMO, but to each their own.  Now, back to stacking ammo and downloading the *How to Field Dress Your Neighbor* manual.
There are a couple with some tiny dings, but I don't really care as they're generic and they were like 10 cents over spot.  The tube ran me $340.01. Hard to say no to that, IMO.   One had what almost looked like a diagonal score line across the back.  I'll try to get some photos up tonight, though sadly my camera isn't the greatest.  They'll go off to the safe deposit box Monday so if I can't get good quality photos tonight, the photos ain't happening :(  They look fine to me, again, generics, don't really care!  [**Photos of by far the worst two**](http://imgur.com/a/orgQl) and it sounds dumb, but they actually look worse in the photos than in person. Being generic as generic gets, doesn't bother me at all.  It's hard to photograph coins with my crappy camera....Subject matter is highly reflective, don't have the best lighting, camera macro isn't the greatest and the auto focus tends to do its own thing, sometimes half is in focus, half a little blurry.
Noob thinking of investing in silver bullion, have some questions for you all   So I'm thinking of investing in some silver bullion as part of some diversification and have some dumb questions I'd appreciate any feedback on. Perhaps eventually add some other precious metals, but would just be starting with silver.  This is a local shop to me, http://www.ajpm.com/silver-bullion.html one thing I really like about them is they post the sell/buy prices so it's a little more illuminating from a financial aspect.  According to http://www.monex.com/prods/silver_chart.html silver is at 19.71 as I type this. That local shop has prices of (bull/sell prices and I'm doing some rounding for the difference):  * American Eagle 21.22/23.32 (difference of $2) * Maple Leafs 20.22/22.82 (difference of $2.5) * 1oz silver rounds 19.97/21.07 (difference of $1) * 10oz silver bar 197.50/210.50 (difference of $13)  First off, are these buy/sell prices pretty normal from a percentage standpoint regardless of the spot price?    Second, why would I want to buy anything other than 1oz silver rounds? With a $1 buy/sell difference (at least today), that seems like the obvious choice.  Again, total noob here, any input is appreciated.

One more thing I can hate about Medium's design/ux   As if the full screen images weren't bad enough (IMO), they seem to have this awesome feature now where [you can't copy/paste text](http://i.imgur.com/w0GlxO8.jpg).  Sure, you can use a web inspector, but that seems ridiculous to me.  You can see this at https://medium.com/life-learning/2a1841f1335d
