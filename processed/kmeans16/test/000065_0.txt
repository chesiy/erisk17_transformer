It's a State of Mind...   Nofap won't magically make you into a better (wo)man. You won't magically start to see girls queue up around you. Your muscles won't magically grow but nofap does give you the drive to make these things happen. It takes time and persistence but in the end you will be more confident (and clear headed) but only if you force yourself into certain situations.  You won't get a girl by sitting on reddit all day. Just go out into the world and meet people (I know, I know easier said than done but it's possible). And I know  it sounds cheesy but just be yourself. Girls must be sick to death of sex obsessed men who just want to get into their pants. Talk to them like you would anyone else and you might find that you really like her. Don't get down if you get rejected a few times.  You won't find going to the gym any easier (if you're new there) and it won't make lifting any lighter but it might give you an extra drive (and a way to get all of your energy out without fapping) and it will make you feel better afterwards.   So go outside (even if it's just for a walk, make yourself walk for one or two hours everyday) and you might be all the better for it. Learn to cook there are quite literally millions of videos on youtube! Start drawing, if all you can do is stick figures, who cares keep going (every master was once a begginer). Learn a language, play and instrument, volunteer! There's so much ***you*** could be doing right now, so go and start.   Nofap is about persistence and patience and hard work and it won't pay off unless you make it.
Okaaay.
Okay, thank you :)
Hi, I can give you a pretty great one, in my opinion anyway. I was a kid when I heard of this and it scared me for weeks but not so much anymore.  It's called: "Kuchisake Onna". It's an urban legend about a woman who's husband became increasingly jealous of her infidelity, he thought she was cheating. So he decided to take her beauty away from her by slitting her mouth from ear to ear giving her a permanent "smile", much like the joker in batman. He then killed her and she became a ghost.  I read about it in detail when I was younger it's kind of interesting.  I won't write the whole story but if you think it sounds good you can read it [here](http://creepypasta.wikia.com/wiki/Kuchisake-Onna) but that version is pretty short.
Ha, ha apparently so. I'm from Scotland it's not nearly as common here.
Wow! That was beautiful. I never expected anything like that. I really have to applaud you. The ending was sad but with a re-read there were hints and the fact that it seemed so *real* is a great bonus. If I never  knew that you had just written that you could put it in a history book and throw a name or two on it and I'd certainly believe it was from the time.
I think a fuppa is a weird way of saying pubes? If it is I shave, best thing to do is shave with the hair, down, untill your skin gets used to it, then after a few weeks if you keep it up you can shave against it for a closer shave. You should buy nivea men 48 hour anti-perspirant. I no longer need it but when I started shaving it made it stay smooth and I never once itched, eventually you get used to it and it won't itch.
So I just relapsed... but that's ok   When I started nofap I made it to around two weeks (I'm a teenager and my hormones got crazy) now on my second try I made it to 3 days. I know it's not great but I've learned from it.   In the time I quit I've started going outside with my friends... a lot. I used to never go outside I would only talk to them at school and through the internet.   I'm a typical "nerd" so I don't have giant muscles etc but I started working out.  I've stopped procrastinating... as much and I only play my xbox for an hour or so a day now (I used to play for at least 7).   All of this is great and just because I relapsed isn't going to stop me from doing them. Even if I was fapping regularly I could do this but nofap helped me realise it.   All of this could just be a placebo effect because I read about other people's benefits from nofap. Even if it is I don't care. I don't because I feel more energetic and alive and I owe that to nofap.   I'm going to start again today and hopefully make it. But untill then I'll just go a day at a time, learn from my mistakes and keep the benefits.
Look I put it in there for those that are religious, don't like it then leave. You can't complain about someone else's beliefs. Ok not everyone is religious but like I said it's there for those that are!! This really isn't a big deal. You're making mountains out of mole holes. No one else here has complained, look at the other comments that have stemmed from yours. Two other people agree with me. It's not a big deal.
Ha, ha :)
I just relapsed today, don't worry about it. I'm just going to pick myself up an  learn from it. Here, good [luck](http://imgur.com/cU848GQ)
I'm at ten days too! :D great job and good luck. I'm having all these benefits too. I'm more of an indoor/gamer type person but I'm going out more, seeing friends that I normally only see at school and the dreams have been great, a lot more vivid but of course Istill play a ton of xbox :)
A slug! Or a snail!
Good luck to you! :D
I'm 15, porn got me when I was 11/12. I was never addicted but I have a few ways to stop fapping when I think about it.  1. Think that porn is just filmed prostitution and that it is wrong   2. Break questions down into yes or no. Should I fap, no. Should I do my homework now, yes. Should I...  3. Think about all the guys on here that say they can't cum when they have sex due to PMO. How horrible it would it be if you lose your virginity (if you haven't yet, I haven't and I don't want to for a few more years yet) and you can't "finish".   4. Think about the 10-10-10 rule (yes I got that from another post). How will you feel in 10 minutes if you fap now? How will you feel in 10 hours? And how will you feel in 10 years if you quit nofap now?  Good luck :) oh and try not to thibk about porn or sex so much, I never really have but who knows everyone is different. When porn/fapping/sex comes to mind acknowledge it and then send it away and think about something else. (Meditation helps too, I've been doing it for a bit now and it's really nice).
Aaw that's nice. I like that more than anything I've seen so far. Just the reassurance :)
