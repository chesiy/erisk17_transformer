Struggle to listen in noisy environments may indicate trouble with reading later in life
Memories influence choice of food
This study looked at serious infections requiring hospitalization, not something like cold virus that we get over 50 times during lifetime.

As I understand, Reddit takes away rights to post anything new or repost after a post was downvoted, so I can't repost it.   Also, if you read the comments to this article, some "real runners" did find it interesting - "My own experience of running competitively (25+ years) bears out the evidence in Hottenrott's study.  The walk breaks enable you to change your movement pattern, refuel/hydrate, and reset your thinking."
How do dogs "see" with their noses?
To know what you are about to put in your mouth, would you use gadgets like  SCiO (a tiny spectrometer and allows you to get instant relevant information about the chemical make-up of just about anything around you) or Peres enose (that sniffs out spoiled food)?
