The LP may not be from the 80s, but that mother fucker stepped straight out of a time vortex.  It explains why he's naked.   Looks like James Cameron got it wrong, you can transport live tissue AND phat kicks.

What would be awesome to us is at the least annoying to her.     *dammit, get around where I can photograph you.*
But the synopsis makes it sound awesome.   The equation has never been more accurate than in the brilliant Czech surrealist's newest film, "Little Otik," based upon a classic fairy tale of an infertile couple who adopt a tree stump as their baby. It quickly grows into an all-devouring monster that eats the cat and then the postman. Locked in the basement, Otik becomes a favorite of Alzbetka, a creepily precocious little girl, who is otherwise engaged in reading books on sexual dysfunction and warding off an octogenarian pedophile.
If you go back and add **DEAD INSIDE** to it, you could catch a Redditor.

Squirrel?
Dear God! Will someone turn on the fucking light so we can see it's just a pile of clothes!

At first I thought why didn't Vivid make a movie with him. But then it hit me, who'd dare take a load from him, let alone a facial.
Is that supposed to be Beast or did a furry wander into the photo?
*Oh my!*
I don't know, just seemed like the thing to do.
Second Guessing Leyland   Here is my 2 cents about last nights disappointment.    End of the 7th, Scherzer's pitch count was at 108 and he was looking mortal.      Start the 8th with Veras, the unofficial set-up man. Get one out, give up hit bringing up Ellsbury.   Ellsbury has a marked L/R split, so pull Veras for Smyly whom doesn't deliver.      Since Victorino is only batting righty and Smyly's L/R OPSa is .446/.648 pull him for AlAl.    With Alburquerque's tendencies I don't like bringing him in with runners on but he K's Victorino.   Now AlAl gives up a single to Pedroia loading the bases for Big Papi.   Leyland decides to go with his main reliever Benoit.  This is a bad situational match-up, while Benoit had not allowed Ortiz a xBH in 26 PA (.273 SLG), with the bases loaded you don't go with a guy allowing a .385 OBA to the hitter.   Especially when you have an Ortiz killer in the bullpen.       Phil Coke has faced Ortiz 20 times with a triple slash of .150/.167/.317        Why would you activate Coke and not use him in the very situation he was made for?    Edit: Thank you to /u/wjg10 for the link the breakdown over at [Fangraphs](http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/assigning-responsibility-for-david-ortiz/)      TL;DR It wasn't a fastball down the middle. They call it a splitter (I've seen slider elsewhere) on the outside edge just above the knees. If Benoit missed with the pitch it was not by much.
