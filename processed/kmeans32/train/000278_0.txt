How about a reddit gift exchange for reloading stuff? (details in post)   So, I thought it would be cool to do a reddit gift exchange about reloading stuff.. The idea is to exchange the un-"dangerous" stuff (No powder, primers, or loaded ammo)  but rather the various sundries reloaders use.. Got a die set for a caliber you haven't used in years? How about those cheap Remington .223 bullets you'll never use.. Lee case lube? Neck brushes?         Think about it.. We all have a lot of stuff that isn't doing us any good, that might just help someone else out..  Likewise, we may receive a product, or doodad that actually helps, and is not something we would have bought ourselves.         Anyway, just throwing the idea out there..

You crossed the *fe*line on that one..        I'll show myself out.  :-)
I'll just leave this (old) pic here..        http://meanspirited.net/people/2009/jan/freecat.jpg
Crap..  Just missed it..        I'm in Sheboygan, and only a 3 hr or so drive from there.. Got all wrapped up with the work stuff a full week early, but already have my ticket home tomorrow.           Should have told them I needed to stay out here another week, and driven out there to check out the B B, and shack.. :-) Maybe make some friends, and finally find myself an Elmer!! :-D
Funnily enough, I think the d'lings are getting pretty used to me working around in the backyard, so.. perhaps? Regardless, I think its cool for however long it lasts. Maybe, if they hang long enough, they might 'imprint' well enough so as I may get visitors to my backyard every year?  Mama, however greets me with fear, and suspect. Wonder if a human screwed with her at some point?         Fun to watch the littl'uns tho. They are *not* graceful on terra firma LOL.
Some ducks moved into my backyard last week.

I can see that side of the argument. (Yeah, I'm not a huge fan of uncle sam having yet more authority over private matters) However, being both a landlord, and a homeowner of a house in a HOA, I think (if nothing else) awareness needs to be brought to this. If it requires a law to be enacted to do so, then so be it. In my short tenure as an amateur radio operator, i've come to understand just how important of a civil service hams are in the event of a disaster. Living in the bay area CA, we all know all too well that we get shakers all the time, and every time I experience one, the cell towers are jammed, landlines typically wont work, and power can be out for up to a few days. In the case of an apartment, or condo complex, having an amateur radio operator with usable antennae would be of a *huge* benefit to the locals.        I think its a good thing for someone to point out these facts to the HOAs so they can make an *educated* decision on allowing (or not) an antenna to be erected. Hearing this argument from the guy who wants to set up the antenna will generally fall on deaf ears, no matter how well reasoned the argument. If the federal government can step in to raise this awareness, then all the better IMO.
My reddit-fu is not strong :-D        Thank you a ton!

This has been posted here before, but heres a (stunningly) visual example of RF "burning" stuff (in my opinion).. Its a vid of a couple Russian kids burning grass on the base of a local stations radio tower.        You'd think, "Its radio frequencies, how can it hurt me?" But, even whats going on inside your microwave is all RF "burning" asymmetric molecules.           Check the video out. (Yeah, RF, especially at any power, needs to be respected.. It will bite.. ) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Scm-tKTHls        ..Mendnwngs
This KX3 auction.        ..I has it.
I'm still new to the radios, so hopefully someone can chine in and correct me where I'm wrong, but the FT-8900 (as I understand) is essentially an 8800, but with more bands. I'm only working VHF/UHF currently, and learning more before I plonk down the cash to dive into HF. The 8800 has glowing reviews (so does the 8900) and the cross-band repeat was important to me (I believe the 8900 does that as well)
I actually did pass my General on the same day as my Tech, so I called the ARRL back today, and they see the mistake. He said they'd be submitting my general creds to the FCC today.  As far as radios, I have the ubiquitous chinese HT, but I also picked up a Yaesu FT-8800.   Going to be building a 2m cubic quad for the house this weekend! :)

Think of how obscured your vision gets when you cross your eyes. Thats only a few degrees "out of whack" if the orb of the eye was removed (but remain attached) your brain would have a very difficult time indeed, making sense of the information coming from both eyes.   Given enough time, (and keeping a constant angle between the eyes) your brain would eventually "figure out" how to put the disparate information together to re-form a whole binocular picture. People with extremely "Lazy" eyes typically have mostly normal vision, but need a couple weeks to "relearn" to see after corrective surgery.

I've been shooting, and reloading for many years now. Unfortunately, my parents are not gun people.. In fact, for quite a while, they were anti-gunners.  For whatever reason, I really hooked into shooting. I have hunted, but my primary pursuit is the elusive tight group on a paper target. Its like golf, or trap shooting to me.. No matter how good you get, you can always do better. My "break in" info comes from the 80 year old goofball that took me under his belt, and walked me through reloading, shooting, and my appreciation of hoarding brass. Yes, I can clean a gun, with emphasis on long guns.. This 80YO goofball is my mentor, and he firmly believes that breaking in a barrel is important. This is what I had to go off of. I now understand that its not important. This .17 shot badass groups at 100 yds out of the box (I did clean it before shooting it, just to get the packing grease out of the barrel)   .   I'm a noob.. even tho I've been doing this for 20+ years. I'm only as good as the info I can get, hence; asking /r/guns if I'm talking out my ass when I ask if barrel break-in is something I should do.   thank you all for your input..    And, FWIW, My .223 shoots less than .7" at 100 Yds everyday. (40Gr Horn. V-max, with 23gr reloader 15)... :-)
Cool.   Thanks all for the info... I'm off to go sight this puppy in!
Agreed.. This.. So much this! I learned about Gong fu style 'brewing' during my first business trip to China. Never would have otherwise found out that the second, and third infusions on most good teas are actually sweeter (and in my opinion superior) to the first infusion. If the idea of navigating around tea leaves while sipping doesnt appeal to you, a Gaiwan is a good choice as a brewing vessel for ease of use, and cleaning, and you can pour the tea off the leaves for each infusion. My favorite tea for Gong Fu service, is a good grade Long Jing tea (Dragonwell).. It really changes from infusion to infusion. Always enjoyable.
