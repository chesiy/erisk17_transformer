Crying for you ;-;
That's pretty cool! :D
Finally taking the plunge on a 3DS and a new Pokemon game   I'm leaning towards the new 3DS since it has better everything compared to the other models you can get new, although the colors don't excite me. :/  I think I am gonna go for Pokemon Y to start with although I eventually want Alpha Sapphire too.  Are there any bundles I should look for? Is it better to get the cartridge or download the game digitally? [I would cry if my pokes became corrupted]  Also, how easy is it for me to send mons from Diamond or HG or Black?  Thanks y'all!
Thanks! :)
I'm considering the same, so I'm just gonna lurk here lol.
So none of those look Paleo to me. They look Archaic/Woodland but it really depends on the part of the country they came from (context context context!) See if the historical society or one of your professors will help you get it recorded in the state site file. Or even better, perhaps there is a nearby professional firm that can help get it recorded.   The thing is, the actual stuff you found may be cool and all, but it's a lot more useful to the scientific community when we can study the relationships between the artifacts and any features that may have been present. Remember, you can't put it back once its excavated!

Coming from a chick here- She's overreacting and does not know how to communicate about what bothers her on an adult level.  Sure it hurts you now and don't let anyone tell you it shouldn't because that's an important part of the healing process. But you will be much happier being with someone who respects you more than that.
Trying to nail down my HS Day Schedule/FP+   Hello friends. I am trying to determine if I am making a HUGE mistake. I think I have decided to risk NOT FP+ing Toy Story Midway Mania. I know, I know! Let me explain.  We have an 8:25 AM Galactic Dine In Star Wars Breakfast Reservation at the Sci Fi Dine In Restaurant for May 6. The park opens at 9. Since I can either FP+ Toy Story or the Rockin Roller Coaster, I think I am going to chance it and take the Roller Coaster since we are so close to Toy Story in the park. I don't want to rush through the breakfast either though so I guess my question is, how soon after 9 AM does the line become unbearable for Toy Story? I have done it before, and it was WONDERFUL and my SO has never done it (and I know he would love it).   What do you think? Thanks in advance and may the force be with you!
Etsy is great too. I just got a set of Chewbacca ears there. Find a seller who makes ones you like, then ask if they will do a custom order.
It says 969.63. I'm beginning to suspect my W4 is not right, and I got lucky last year.
Awesome!! I didn't know you could try more than one thing. :D   It is a little pricey, but I keep telling myself how many awesome benefits there are to it. :3   How was the food?
LOL I never thought about it that way but you are right. :)
Georgia Southern was barred from postseason FCS games last year because of the transition, but that was a team wide application.   This page has some good info for individual athletes.  http://www.athleticscholarships.net/college-transfer-4-4.htm
Yeah, the stupid rule thing is my main argument. We have met (and exceeded) all the FBS qualifications. We wouldn't have made the transfer if we didn't. I'm bummed out that we are the only conference champs whose season is (probably) already over. I'm bummed out for the senior players who stuck it through the transition, beat Florida in the Swamp, earned an undefeated conference championship, and now have to watch teams they beat go play on the national stage instead. Give me a ONE MORE TIME!!  :)
