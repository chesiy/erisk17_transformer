Wurly. Definitely wurly.
Family reunions.
What's the meaning of life?
Yesterday, I believe.
The exact same thing happened to me yesterday, I did the side a little too short. I know pretty much how you feel. I'm sure you did your best, and had the best intentions. As did I. Feel free to PM me if you need to talk x
For what it's worth; happy birthday OP. Keep your head up, x
Meh.
I don't tend to venture into Sauchiehall street too much, been to firewater a few times but other than that I haven't been to the other clubs; I just know of them. The only thing that seems to be appealing to most people about campus is the prices.   Might check out Victorias and the other you mentioned. Thanks!
That's awesome! Much appreciated :)
Does anyone else still choose to hide scars, despite family/friends knowing and have already seen your scars? *possibly triggering*   I still cut, just not anywhere they would see. But I'm curious if anyone else is the same. I don't mind in public, but if I were to see anyone I know; I'd pull down my sleeves.

It's worthwhile telling your doctor, I'm prescribed 150mg and I've never been sick because of it. Feeling nauseous is normal at the beginning though.
Laughed far too much at this!
Awesome tattoos dude :)
You're welcome. Pm me if you ever need to talk :)
That's awesome! It may not feel like it, but it's the little things that count :)
