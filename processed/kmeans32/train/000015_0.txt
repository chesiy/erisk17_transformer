I don't know if I'd go so far as to say Ring is Carrick-esque but I like where your heads at in looking at him. Wasn't impressed with is vision or his ball winning ability--I see better technique in Pena and better awareness though I would give the workrate to Ring hands down.     And as far as the research goes, I watched the highlights and as many fullgame replay videos as I could find (think I just missed finding one full match). So though I crammed them all into one day of viewing and reviewing and reviewing, I will defer to supporters like yourself that see the guys play every week.    Thanks for talking! Hope to keep getting better over at MidfieldPress
that was my thought as well. I just want the team to stay around, moving to MLS ensures that whereas the needless competition with another soccer team in the cities would most likely dissolve the team. Already the Silverbacks are on borrowed time thanks to MLSAtlanta

Would My Books Pass the Bechdel Test?
To you your first point, I agree. Asking the questions was less about quality and more about just how am I (if I am) crafting an inclusive work.  To your second point, you're right. When I originally thought of the story I wanted to have my 'hero' be trans but then I realized I wasn't knowledgeable enough to write a convincing character. Still hoping to in the future.

Will do better in the future. A cleaner edition than the ARC given is what is available. Though the manuscript was a NaNoWriMo project   for a once through, I thought it rather good enough to share. And then there's this: http://www.wired.com/2014/08/wuwt-typos/

Part of the siege of one of the cities in [Adversaries Together](https://www.createspace.com/5113670) is based on anecdotes from the siege of Leningrad. Hoping to have the next novel in the series expand on it
I wrote [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4) to feature three strong woman leads--one an aggressive adventurer, one a scrappy daughter of a city's leader, and another a nun-like character that sheds her naivete but refuses to compromise her beliefs. All done without having to fall in love or be damsels in distress
[Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4) is about groups of elites in a fantasy world looking to conquer--one character is looking to take over the world's religion, another wants to become emperor, and a third wants to bring to the world to its knees by dominating it economically
[Promo] Adversaries Together, A New Fantasy Series   Adversaries Together is the first book in a planned seven book series I began last November as part of National Novel Writing Month. Check it out and look for book two to appear soon!  Check it out here: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_awdm_EUOxub05HQ5T3  "A city that's been under siege for a thousand days. A rising empire and a power hungry religion. A resource so precious that its production controls the world. In the world of Syr Nebra, there is no such thing as magic, yet every human clings to their faith and country. Avery Roth is a wanderer scratching out a living in the hinterlands trying to avoid the religious zealots of The Cathedral and the imperial ambitions of The Seven Spires. But when a young woman and her paladin guardian literally run into him in the wild as they are fleeing bandits, he is entangled in a political web that tightens the more he struggles to free himself and others."

if the Atlanta Silverbacks brand isn't bought by Blank   a wholly new team is plopped down in the city, then I'll see this as a American soccer failure. we need more teams but we need more teams where there aren't already teams. Anyway. I think buying the brand like the Sounders, Timbers, Whitecaps,   Impact all did would be the best route
