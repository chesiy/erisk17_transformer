Yeah you're right. That would be nice to see.
Focus on not dying
I quit rs3 to play osrs and I'm done with osrs. Runescape will never be what it was. It really is a shame, but I'm tired of dealing with the toxicity of the community, the meaninglessness of achieving once sought after goals such as a maxed account or a huge cash stack. No. I just can't continue dumping time and effort into this game.
I dream quite a bit actually. I have chronic night terrors, too.
Necessity.  I'm a college student and worked as an RA for a year (shh don't tell my supervisor) and had little money left over after purchasing my little supply. I also didn't want to be going around with a piece and obviously couldn't smoke indoors. I opted to going with the blunt/joint route. It's cheap, simple, and when you finish your sesh you don't have any incriminating paraphernalia on your person. Albeit rolling is much harder than packing a bowl, but I learned to roll well in only a little while. I suggest starting out with blunts or wraps as I feel they are easier to roll than papers - but it's certainly a personal preference.   Definitely a good stoner-skill to know!
I'm sorry I wish I could tell you haha. I have two coils and I think it's 26ga. I'm new to this and I still have a lot to learn!
The first couple times I smoked nothing happened; it became frustrating for me. I wanted to know what being high was like. I then started to get high and understood what it was like.   Just be careful when you first start out. You may see that people smoke more than you. Don't worry, that's okay; it isn't a contest. Being *too* high is a thing and it isn't good if you're first starting out. I also suggest doing it somewhere safe around good company (or alone. There's nothing wrong with smoking alone). Just enjoy yourself. Welcome to the community and happy toking!

I used to have an m80 with a plume veil RDA, but I sold it to a friend and now I have an ABS dual 18650 box mod with a Royal Hunter. I like it quite a bit, actually.
Was...was he okay?

My last year as undergrad ME
Handcheck on this rainy day!
The Martian - Andy Weir. It's one of the best books I've read in a long time.
I just finished the book. I loved every second of it. I'm embarrassed to admit, however, that I finished it in 1 day.
Thanks, Reagan
Would there have been an audible "thud" when the larger dinosaurs walked around?
I've heard of them encountering problems with the earlier firmware, but mine is up to date. So far I'm really liking it and haven't had any problems with it.
What's wrong with the m80?
My very first purchase!
And it still is?
So capitalist in your ways of thinking
Hey I feel your pain. I've noticed the same trends on 9gag. Scrolling through the posts and reading comments which were initially there for my entertainment, became something unseemingly sinister. The people are mean - not just a little mean, but the truest from of the word. They revel in their bad habits of being shut-ins, and unmotivated membera.of society who wish to do nothing more than play their games and bully those who think differently than themselves.  I've decided to kill my time through books and sketching, rather than giving my thumb a workout through the toxicity of that website.
215!
My nightlight tonight [7]
When there's a knock at the door
That made me so mad when I saw that. That guy was so sad when they shot his dog. I felt horrible.
I would pay to see Julian get his bird sucked by Lahey

Isn't this what you weird goth people wore along with ample amounts of chain?
Top left-hand corner anyone?
I'm sorry you had to depart with your chin - that's a shame. But yes, they are extremely sociable and smart little creatures. I let mine run around an hor or two a day and give him plenty of chew toys. He seems to be happy. I've only had him for a couple months.
