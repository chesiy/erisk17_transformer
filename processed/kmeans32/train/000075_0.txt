If you can't afford a walkin clinic You might try your local health department or if you continue with the high temp or it goes up go to the emergency room the worst that can happen is they'll give you aspirin and send you home. Good luck!
Thanks for reposting this as I would have missed it if you hadn't. Sometimes repost are a good thing.
You are most welcome, good luck!
The problem with that is we're not developing the next generation of intelligent people at nearly the rate the Chinese are. They will over take us in the next ten to twenty years if we don't do something about it.
My 14 year-old dog started to get grumpy and I took him to the vet and explained the problem but the vet found no problems with his health, I got him home and did a complete exam and found he had a molar going bad so I took him to another vet and had the tooth pulled, he's back to normal now behavior wise. Finding the bad tooth was not easy at all. I had to push on it just right to invoke a reaction from my mutt.

As Price was jumping back over the counter, he shot a sixty-seven year old customer who tried to stop him. After shooting the customer in the neck, Price left the bank, discharging two (2) rounds from his revolver as he fled. The shooting victim was transported by Deerfield Beach Fire Rescue to North Broward Medical Center. He remains in critical but stable condition  The bank is insured so this was a stupid move on the old guys part, foolish hero.
No, I can see and read your comment, wonders never cease!
Not at all, but if you go do this in front of your kid then yes you would be a terrible person but only as long as you're standing, as soon as you hit the ground you'd be a corpse...

Do you run a metal detector over the body to look for such items as a pace maker or metal pins or rods before the cremation. I would think it would be foolish to cremate the remains with any valuable recyclable items.

Careful about posting defamatory complaints directed at huge corporations. I'm still trying to find out what happened to the redditor who posted the $ears thread.
Since she's reaching out to you it's up to you how to handle the info, I'd tell my Dad and let him decide what to do about it.
I've never taken street manufactured drugs mainly due to the lack of oversight and quality control in the manufacturing, I get my drugs legally from my Dr just like Michael . My brother in-law died from a hot shot of street heroin.  If something doesn't feel right don't do it.
"But when he rides the Segwell, they shout abuse from their cars: "Too lazy to walk, ya fuckin homo? Someone riding a motorcycle isn't working any harder. But because he's sitting astride it, he seems to be making an effort. When you're riding a Segway you're just standing there."  Try yelling homo at someone riding a motorcycle you'll get a ass whooping. That is unless they're on a Honda.
