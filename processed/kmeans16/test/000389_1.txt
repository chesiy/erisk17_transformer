Air travel on thanksgiving...
Go Cyclones!!!
Don't forget the bacon!!
It is sturdy. Feels like something that would be used for a throw pillow. I liked it because it seemed thick enough that I wouldn't need to line the fabric so it wasn't see through.
Thanks!
Thanks! I got it from hobby lobby. Was just thinking I should have written down the brand. Good luck with yours! Mine was fun. PLENTY of inconsistencies because I'm a beginner, but with the help of the video, it was pretty easy.
This happened to me once. I was working with a piece that started with 150 ch, so it was pretty big. I didn't want to tear my work out, so I ended up single crocheting down the side that had the dropped stitch(es) and back. It looked like a repair, but I was glad to have a fix that didn't require undoing 8 hours of work.
This is amazing! Did you make it up or use a pattern?
All great suggestions! I am a white female getting an MA in Communication Studies. My assistantship includes TAing and teaching one of my own classes. It feels like an impossible task to find scholarships for a non-minority, non-STEM graduate student.
I am on the opposite side of the issue. In fact, one of the worst things about depression for me is that I don't know how to ask my boyfriend or close friends to help. Last night, I called the suicide hotline. I am not suicidal, but I wanted to talk to someone about this extra burden I feel. I don't think I got any straight-forward answers, because I got the feeling that they are just there to listen and guide your thoughts while giving you a chance to talk. However, I don't think I was looking for straight-forward answers. I just needed someone to talk to that I didn't have a committed friendship or with.   TLDR: Call the suicide hotline for depression counseling. They are also there to help people whose loved ones have depression.
