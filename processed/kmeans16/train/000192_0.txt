Hmmm...makes you wonder how insane this headline will seem in another 20 years or so
They also scolded prosecutors for investigating citizens who were wholly innocent of any wrongdoing, and boasted that the ruling will help protect every other Wisconsinite in the future from tyrannical retribution and capricious government prosecution.  But we want to drug test anyone receiving food stamps.
Buh-bye!

I am outraged. I'm outraged that people are insured who should be paying out of pocket or going without treatment. I'm outraged that, to pay for it, the government has to either tax (meaning I lose money), borrow (keeping the interest rate low which means since I'm an investor rather than a borrower I lose money), or inflate the currency (which, again, since I have investments makes them worth less and I lose money  You believe some people who can't afford to pay should go without treatment?  Not everyone can afford it, but everyone is somebody's   son, daughter, mother, father, brother, sister, or grandparent...if poor people get sick, do you believe that we should leave them to die? Is money more important that a persons life?
Very well said.  I don't agree with you  about the size of government or that it is evil, it is the politics you cannot trust, but your position on vaccines makes sense to me.  I think government should be bigger with lots more us citizens working in and for the government, so that more people benefit and are better represented.  I am pro choice, and completely agree that the government has no business telling you what to do with your body
awww...what kind of dog is he?
very cool!
very good!
