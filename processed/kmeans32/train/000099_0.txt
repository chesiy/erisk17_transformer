Law enforcement and private investigators will use the information to try to:  1. Identify individuals based on behavioral analysis of comments, etc.  2. De-anonymize individuals and leverage this information on other platforms, i.e. checking identical/similar usernames and using the behavioral analysis to predict other (online or offline) hangouts and activities in order to build a more complete picture.  Sociologists and psychologists will use it to build behavioral models for individuals acting as individuals and for ad-hoc groups of individuals without any external organization, goal, etc.  Members of the public and historians will use it to look at and for public figures and to better understand them. More importantly, the public should use this database as a wake-up call that the driving force behind Big Data isn't Big Brother - it's the masses. Between this and the Dark Net Market archives and some other releases in the last few weeks, it's becoming more apparent that the "right to be forgotten" may be recognized by some governments but private individuals and researchers, not just megacorps, remain major obstacles to it.  This is, simply put, the biggest example of open source SIGINT to date. The fact that it was done legally and openly, and not as the result of a hack or data leak, may make it seem less newsworthy - but if anything, it makes even more alarming to privacy advocates. It's not a one-off either, it's just one of the biggest signposts we've seen so far.  -------------
Last May, after an earthquake, the Water Level of Lake Mead went down by about 8 Feet in 24 hours. Authorities said it was a mistake and the next day 8+ Feet of water was added. Now the Water Level figures for Lake Mead have been Taken Down.
The documentary "Everything Is A Rich Man's Trick" wasn't just 3.5 hours of History--the website calls for REVOLUTION NOW..."We, the people, do hereby give notice of our intention to withdraw completely any mandate to rule from the British and American establishment."
I definitely feel your frustration, but The Cabal rules the media--they can sell any lie (or just force the media not to cover a story). Once in a while the media breaks a story--but ultimately there is no meaningful follow-up. Case in point: June 28th (a saturday) the Wash Post broke a story accusing the CIA of withholding 14,000 photos from evidence--no major network has followed up...  Even if there is an official congressional investigation--it ends up as controlled opposition (a Farce).

Wm. Casey was supposed to meet up with a commission looking into the records of JFK right before he died...the film states Casey spoke with Congress 32 times--way more than any previous director of CIA...  I linked an article which delves into Casey's death further--pretty good read...I stayed away from posting Casey's links to the Phoenix program in Vietnam (and other controversial aspects of his career).  It should also be noted who took Casey's place in the CIA: GHW Bush.
France Mulls Offering Asylum to Julian Assange and Edward Snowden
Is it possible to Prosecute those who ordered Torture of "enemy combatants" under U.S. Federal RICO Laws?   The CIA at this point has been proven to have:   + Tortured (some even died as a result)   + Obstructed investigations (the CIA destroyed about 90 videotapes while involved in a U.S. court case, the 9/11 Commission also wrote an editorial in the *New York Times* stating their investigation was obstructed by the White House and CIA) http://www.salon.com/2008/01/02/obstruction/  + Spied on U.S. citizens on U.S. soil--including U.S. senators (last year the CIA was caught lying about spying on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence during their investigation into CIA torture) http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2014/07/31/234997/cia-staffers-accessed-senate.html  + Imported drugs to the U.S. (Iran-Contra)  + Money Laundering (BCCI)  -------------  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racketeer_Influenced_and_Corrupt_Organizations_Act  The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, commonly referred to as the RICO Act or simply RICO, is a United States federal law that provides for extended criminal penalties and a civil cause of action for acts performed as part of an ongoing criminal organization. The RICO Act focuses specifically on racketeering, and it allows the leaders of a syndicate to be tried for the crimes which they ordered others to do or assisted them, closing a perceived loophole that allowed a person who instructed someone else to, for example, murder, to be exempt from the trial because he did not actually commit the crime personally.[1]  ---------------
Either over the winter or last fall, the U.S. media all started chirping the same story about Venezuela being a threat to the U.S.--which was laughable, so I posted the annual military budgets for each...but, YES, the U.S. thru the CIA and its Economic Hit Men have certainly manipulated and taken advantage of the countries in Central and South America.   Now imagine Venezuela's problem but 1,000 times bigger--that's what we have in the U.S.--our politicians are bought by corporations, our laws are made by corporations and our wars are planned by WAR, INC.

I checked...not sure why but I could only find short clips on youtube (except for 1 very bad version)...  I'm a truther , too...I think Bush/Cheney didn't want any suspects on U.S. soil because they knew they couldn't control the cover-up under normal U.S. court procedures. It's completely absurd that the 9/11 Commission was only initially given $3 million--yet the SSCI initially funded the Torture Report Re-write (in Dec. 2008) with $40 million off the bat. This was so CIA-approved attorneys could shred the Torture Report from 6,300 pages down to 400 pages.  And, Yes--it's definitely infuriating.
I was researching this a bit last year--  I think you'll find the 2nd part of [**this post**](http://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/2fnykt/q_its_1961_the_height_of_the_cold_war_the_us_has/) I assembled quite interesting...  Another author to check out would be Antony Sutton--there are a few of his pdf's at r/TSBD along with a video or two in the comments.
I definitely agree that Americans have undersold the contributions (and massive suffering) which the Soviet Union contributed to defeating the Nazis in WWII. The first book I read from the Russian side was Antony Beevor's collection of Vasily Grossman's writing titled [**A WRITER AT WAR**](http://www.antonybeevor.com/index.php/previous-books/a-writer-at-war-vasily-grossman-with-the-red-army-1941-1945/).  I've also been looking into the root causes of the Cold War--which was much more a manufactured product than many Americans can wrap their heads around. Antony Sutton dug a bit too deep into Stanford's research collection and revealed that 90% of Soviet technology was derived from the West--certainly made the Establishment (aka the profiteers) uncomfortable. [**HERE'S**](http://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/2fnykt/q_its_1961_the_height_of_the_cold_war_the_us_has/) a post I threw up about how the Cold War was largely manufactured by the CIA-Pentagon. Last Veteran's Day, I dared to ask [**DO AMERICAN'S UNDERVALUE RUSSIA'S HELP IN WINNING WWII**](http://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/35et05/do_americans_undervalue_russias_help_in_winning/)
At the time, Cheney-Bush claimed it was "because we were at war and couldn't afford to distract resources". But, I think it was far more devious than that:   1. [**Cheney-Bush asked Senator Tom Daschle NOT**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pTt2cQvUww) to have the Senate-House of Representatives Intelligence Committees Investigate (this was known as the "Joint Commission")  2. Cheney-Bush Stalled the formation of the 9/11 Commission and underfunded the Commission once it was finally formed--the 9/11 Commission was initially funded with only $3 million. For reference, the investigation of Bill Clinton-Monica Lewinski cost over $40 million...in 2008 the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence funded the Torture Report with $40 million--this was to EDIT a 6,300 page report using only CIA-approved attorneys (not to write the report!). The 9/11 Commission would eventually receive about $14 million in total--about one-third of the cost of the Torture Report (Re-Write).  3. Cheney-Bush attempted to place Henry Kissinger (CIA-insider) as Commissioner of the 9/11 Commission. [**HK met with some of the victims' families**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmHPfXemf10) in his office--they asked him if his law firm would disclose a list of clients (to make sure there were no potential conflicts of interest). HK wouldn't disclose and turned the position down.   4. The eventual Commissioner would be Lee Hamilton (and Thomas Kean)--who had served on the Iran-Contra hearings with (guess who?)...Dick Cheney...In 1989, after they successfully shut down the open Iran-Contra Hearings from revealing too much--Dick Cheney was awarded by the new president, GHW Bush (former CIA Director), with a nice step up: Secretary of Defense (even tho Cheney had taken 5 deferments during Vietnam)  5. The 9/11 Commission was given a tight timeframe: 16 months (compare that to the 4 years which the Torture Report rewrite was allowed). In addition, the 9/11 Commission office in DC was in a CIA managed building...(remember the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence scandal last year in which the CIA was SPYING on the SSCI)  5. The first thing Cheney did in office was to hold his secret Energy Task Force meetings--the ACLU and the press demanded to know info about the meetings but was denied. [**Eventually--2 years later**](http://www.foxnews.com/story/2003/07/18/cheney-energy-task-force-documents-detail-iraqi-oil-industry.html) the ACLU was able to get a few pages of their meeting released (one of the pages was a map of Iraqi oilfields along with what companies were under contract). Cheney and the CIA also planned for [**Regime Change in Iraq**](http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4499540/scott-ritter-claims-regime-change-us-policy-goal-towards-iraq-1990-2003) since the 90's...  6. During the 90's--after the fall of the USSR, the US defense and intelligence agencies were hurting from budget cuts and scandals--and, even  worse, could no longer yell "COMMIE!!!" and receive Billions. After GHW Bush left office, Cheney went to Halliburton--but one of Cheney's last acts as Sec. of Defense was to fund a study examining the potential for privatizing some functions of the DoD.  7. Ultimately, YES, 9/11 was a long-planned, super-compartmentalized DoD-CIA operation with a goal to give the US a new Super Villain and thereby revive the defense and intelligence sectors. For those who think hundreds or thousands had to know--that's BS--the CIA-DIA operates in extreme secrecy. In the mid-70's the Church Committee took a look at CIA operations: [**the CIA had run 9,000 small operations and 3,000 large operations**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3ioJGMCr-Y) between 1947-1972...every one of the operations was the definition of a conspiracy.  8. In addition, Cheney-Bush shut down the SEC investigation of the stock market profiteers who placed PUT options on United on 9/11. The Patriot Act was forced down the throats of Congress, [**the intelligence agencies**](http://projects.washingtonpost.com/top-secret-america/) and the defense contractors expanded exponentially. Booz Allen (which the Carlyle Group would buy) even began getting millions of dollars in  September, 2001.  9. After the victims' families and the press finally pressured President Bush to testify before the 9/11 Commission, the President of the United States finally agreed...but only if it was NOT under oath, NOT in public and NO notes were taken...The President also demanded he be allowed to have Dick Cheney hold his hand, too. Bush-Cheney had screamed "9-11" from the rooftops on a daily basis--but couldn't even officially testify in public and on the record to the 9/11 Commission. As a bonus insult, Bush held a [**5-minute "press conference"**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bnuvtRo8b0) afterwards in which only 6 questions were asked. Odd that C-Span has deleted the press conference--9/11 researcher Jon Gold posted it for us on youtube (otherwise we might not be able to see it). Please watch the "press conference" for yourself and note the words and body language--is this man telling us the full truth? Notice he can't even say he "testified" and has to say "I had a conversation" with...  --------------  EDIT:  what many of you are Failing to comprehend is that America is a CORPORATOCRACY--it is no longer a free republic and there is NO "democracy"...if you fill large office buildings with people and pay them six-figure salaries they will tell you what you want to hear...One example is the [**Cold War LIES**](http://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/2fnykt/q_its_1961_the_height_of_the_cold_war_the_us_has/) that the USSR was ahead in nuclear capability--the Pentagon and CIA and the RAND corporation advised the President the Soviets had more missiles--when, in fact, the US was well ahead of the USSR. The [**DoD can't account for $8.5 TRILLION**](http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/19/85-Trillion-Unaccounted-Should-Congress-Increase-Defense-Budget)--yet every business, every citizen and every government agency is by law required to submit to an audit every year (except for the DoD and the Three Letter Agencies)...the Military-Media-Industrial-Intelligence-Congressional Corporate Complex will sure as hell do what it has to do in order to ensure the Billions upon Billions of dollars keep flowing.
Below are two excerpts from [*INSIDE THE COMPANY: A CIA DIARY*](http://np.reddit.com/r/TSBD/comments/30oi1g/inside_the_company_cia_diary_by_philip_agee/) by Philip Agee (1975)...just THINK about how much the CIA and all the other agencies have grown since then--in 1990 there were 11 intelligence agencies, today there are (at least) 17.   ---------  When I joined the CIA I believed in the need for its existence. After twelve years with the agency I finally understood how much suffering it was causing, that millions of people all over the world had been killed or had had their lives destroyed by the CIA and the institutions it supports. I couldn't sit by and do nothing and so began work on this book.  --------------  Even after recent revelations about the CIA it is still difficult for people to understand what a huge and sinister organization the CIA is. It is the biggest and most powerful secret service that has ever existed. I don't know how big the KGB is inside the Soviet Union, but its international operation is small compared with the CIA's. The CIA has 16,500 employees and an annual budget of $750,000,000. That does not include its mercenary armies or its commercial subsidiaries. Add them all together, the agency employs or subsidizes hundreds of thousands of people and spends billions every year. Its official budget is secret; it's concealed in those of other Federal agencies. Nobody tells the Congress what the CIA spends. By Law, the CIA is not accountable to Congress.  -------------
I reposted it because the bankers have been "negotiating" their deals with the SEC.  I think it drives home the point: if you are a banker with millions to spend on fucking attorneys--HEY, no big deal...no one has to go to jail even though BILLIONS have been STOLEN from both the public and private traders which the companies handle deals for.  meanwhile, if you are poor and black or hispanic in the U.S.--you better watch the fuck out because you can be harassed/arrested/killed at any moment.
---------  also strange that the CIA spent untold amounts on operations as well as untold amounts of cash bribing everyone they could in Afghanistan and Pakistan to find out where UBL was...then they finally get lucky--after spending BILLIONS--and have an informer  WALK-IN who worked for the Pakistani ISI come in and cough up UBL's location.   also strange that the U.S. gave Military Aid to Pakistan from 2002-2011--up to $3 Billion per year ($30 Billion total).   also strange that Porter Goss, John Kerry and Bob Graham were with the head of the Pakistan's ISI on 9/11 in Washington DC  also strange that the head of Pakistan's ISI quit about a week after 9/11 because a newspaper from India published an article outing him as having sent the 9/11 hijackers money  but most folks don't remember all that.  ----------------
The $4 Trillion which the U.S. has spent in Afghanistan and Iraq since 9/11 could have provided 40 Million Americans with $100,000 condos (or the U.S. could have provided 200 Million Americans with a $20,000 down payment to purchase property)
there's also L. Fletcher Prouty's very convincing discussion of how Atsugi airbase in Japan was for the cream of the crop--it was Top Secret--located underground. The men who were stationed there worked on the CIA's U2 flights...  There were also 2 RIFLES found at the TSBD: a German Mauser and the Italian Carcano...You can watch Walter Cronkite informing the public about the Mauser--and see BOTH of the rifles in "Evidence of Revision"  EDIT: if you haven't seen it yet--you should watch "Everything Is A Rich Man's Trick" on youtube (it has a couple of curveballs, but, overall is a must-see)
the fucking criminals at the Pentagon and the CIA don't necessarily have to go to war to profit--all they need to do is scare the fuck out of stupid Americans--strike fear into them so they can spend whatever amount of money they want on their bullshit programs--  http://redd.it/21andu  FYI: the U.S. had about 300 nuclear weapons in 1950...by 1960 the U.S. had 18,000 nuclear weapons.

very well written article with some great quotes by former LEOs.  i see the cops literally preying upon the African-American population everyday where I live...they literally drive down a main street from a white part of town, pull into the walmart--so they can check all the license plates...then they wait for them to drive out, pull them over and, cha-ching--more money for the corporate prison complex.   some municipalities actually have parking enforcement drive around and ticket out of state vehicles once they are parked in an area over 30 days for not transferring plates (it might even be shorter than 30 days).  for those who haven't heard: the License Plate Readers the cops use while they are cruising mall parking lots (or pulling you over) will automatically pull up the registered river's info and make different audio sounds for offenses (a cash register opening for a late ticket payment, etc)....dana priest (Wash Post) reported on this in her 2006 book *Top Secret America* (which was mostly focused on the growth of the government/corporate intelligence agencies post 9/11).  ---------

So, in addition to NSA Insiders' claiming the NSA obstructed the 9/11 Commission--we also have the Co-Chairs of the 9/11 Commision who claimed their investigation was obstructed by the White House and the CIA...Glenn Greenwald wrote an article in 2008: http://www.salon.com/2008/01/02/obstruction/  In fact, when former 9/11 Commission member Max Cleland was asked if there should be another 9/11 Commission, he said: "There should be fifteen 9/11 Commissions!!!"  http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2014/07/911-commissions-forum-shows-dc-works-4.html
I think the U.S. should apoligize to Iraq and LEAVE...over a decade of useless war stirred up by the sloppy u.s. overthrow and invasion which has cost TRILLIONS...millions of Iraqi lives ruined because The neocons at the Pentagon wanted to take over the Middle East...  Michael Hastings also quoted a 2008 RAND study which was interesting: they studied over 600 terrorist organizations since 1968--only 7% of the organizations came to an end via military action...43% of the groups came to a political settlement...40% were ended via local law enforcement-intelligence actions...another item Hastings brought up was what Gen. McChrystal called "Afghan Math"...if there are ten insurgents and you kill two--you may end up with twenty insurgents...so, 10-2 does not equal 8...10-2 equals twenty...yet, the u.s. persists in dronings and air strikes...  http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2whkg9/well_hunt_you_down_and_kill_you_if_we_dont_like/
of course I wasn't implying the mayoral election isn't news--but I could literally scream from the number of times the front page has been infiltrated with Wrigley Field rehab updates instead of, say, how the Pentagon has Never submitted to an AUDIT...the Trib, the NYT, cnn, cbs, abc, nbc--they have all FAiLED to investigate and question--and given a Free Pass all too often...the "news" papers/media now resort to asking the DOJ before printing an article on Edward Snowden or the Patriot Act...the scariest thing is that Americans believe this vacuous reporting--at least in Russia the citizens know they are being lied to  and, YES, I would be happy to see the Chicago Tribune go OUT OF BUSINESS--the editors and publishers FAILED to protect the public interest long ago...

The U.S. has spent about [$10 TRILLION in total National Security Budget since 9/11](http://www.pogo.org/our-work/straus-military-reform-project/defense-budget/2014/americas-one-trillion-national-security-budget.html) including about $5 TRILLION on the useless wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.   The lies of the Bush-Cheney War Criminals have all been shredded--there were no WMDs in Iraq, there were no Iraqi-Al Qaeda connections. The Bush-Cheney administration claimed Usama bin Laden (et al.) planned and carried out the attacks of 9/11--yet the administration balked when Afghanistan offered to capture and turn over UBL if the U.S. could show proof that UBL committed the 9/11 attacks.   Instead, Bush-Cheney never provided any evidence--they sent in the CIA into Afghanistan with plenty of CASH on hand to pay off Afghan warlords to help hunt UBL in Tora Bora. Apparently throwing millions of dollars around in foreign countries doesnt always guarantee success--so the U.S. military went to war in Afghanistan.   Back in the U.S., the Bush-Cheney War Criminals began covering up 9/11 by asking the Joint Congressional Inquiry into 9/11 NOT to investigate--in fact [Dick Cheney asked Tom Daschle NOT to investigate several times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePOIhhd9Jr0). The CIA, the FBI, the NSA all stonewalled the 9/11 Commission at every turn as well. In the end, the 9/11 Commission co-chairmen wrote a letter in the *NYT* accusing the [White House and the CIA of OBSTRUCTING the 9/11 investigation](http://www.salon.com/2008/01/02/obstruction/).  General Wesley Clark is also on the record stating the [Bush-Cheney War Criminals intended to go to War with 7 countries in 5 years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RC1Mepk_Sw).   I dont know what exactly happened on 9/11--but I do know the U.S. government is LYING and the 9/11 Commission Report was a WHITEWASH. If you havent looked into any of these issues I would urge you do some research--because the USA seems to have become fixated on war.   The list of countries the US has bombed and/or attempted to overthrow the government of since the end of WWII is most likely much longer than you think. Lately, I definitely worry that eventually the world is going to get sick of the US bullying its way around the globe with boots on the ground in over 100 countries.

3 BEST documentaries on youtube for JFK info...   1. Attorney Mark Lane's 1966 book/film "Rush to Judgement" documents the accounts of about 20 witnesses in Dealey Plaza on 11-22-63. The witnesses all had excellent views of the tragic events, yet, had their testimony ignored by the Warren Commission. By the time the documentary came out many Americans had been effectively, and continuously, sold the OSWALD MYTH by the repetitious drones of the FBI and Warren Comm.  2. "The Men Who Killed Kennedy" Parts 1-9 (1988-2003)...While Ken Burns was taking documentary films to new heights by covering the Civil War, Baseball and Jazz, the English produced "TMWKK" series which covers many avenues--some being shocking for their plausibility and others covering aspects which stretch science and imaginations a bit too much. Very telling that this was made in England--and that the last 3 parts were BANNED from American TV. Also notable is the number of witnesses who only speak out as they retire from their jobs--including 16 doctors from Parkland Hospital who all make corroborating statements regarding JFK's wounds.  3. "Evidence of Revision" Parts 1-6 plus extras (2006)."Documents which define history should belong to the public, not private interests"...My favorite Epic Documentary Masterpiece which delves into the assassinations of JFK, MLK and RFK. The film has a wealth of rare, live footage from the days the events occurred as well as info from recently released intelligence files. "E of R" boldly steps into arenas that will challenge your thoughts on the history of American defense/intelligence agencies as they became involved with Vietnam.  These 3 films expose the shocking events in many ways the American public was unable to see at the time. The public was not allowed to see the Zapruder film until the mid-1970's (there were only still images released until then). Even 50 years later, there is a great deal of files the government still will NOT release--as if 50 YEARS LATER it is still a national security issue. The films often present evidence the JFK assassination was a COUP D'ETAT and an action which allowed the military, intelligence, financial, and energy sectors to expand their will upon the American people--and the world. You might totally disagree with this conclusion--but to NOT view these films (and do other research) would be a short-sighted failure to question the *official* government version. Authorities have only released info in a painstakingly slow drip-by-drip manner--and has treated Americans like SERFS who do not deserve to know the truth about their own history.  All 3 films dive fearlessly into territories that are difficult for many of us because they challenge our beliefs--which can be threatening. Certainly, to truly begin to understand the events it requires a great deal of thought and a vast storage of memory--but these documentaries take giant leaps into asking the right questions and should leave your brain cells rattling a bit as you realize some of the many theories which directly EXTINGUISH the OSWALD MYTH. (if you have not seen them all docs are FREE on youtube--just be advised to make sure you are watching the FULL version...example: the full version of MLK (part 6) in "E of R" is hard to find and also has rare, shocking photos of lynchings which are presented in a historical context to show the vicious racism which existed into the middle of the 20th century).
