They could've used the spell that either Crouch or Amos used in the beginning of the book as well. It would've shown them the last few spells Harry used, and then they would've seen that he didn't kill Cedric.   Honestly, I think that even the Ministry couldn't find a way to justify Harry being the killer. They knew that if they did that, the rest of the Wizarding World would've known Harry was telling the truth, because he's the Boy Who Lived.
She's my girlfriend and she's a small part of the problem. I need to talk to her about it, and I will. I just don't want to .  As to why I don't want to exist, I couldn't tell you. Again, I'm not suicidal, I just don't want to be anymore. Like I just want to be empty. I already feel like a living shell of who I once was, and I wish I could say it was the first time.   I laid in bed last night, and all I could think about was how I wanted to be anywhere but there. But then I thought about staying at my girlfriends place, and that thought was also unappealing (that one being a first, I've never not wanted to stay with her). So I started thinking about other places I could go to crash, and nothing sounded good. So I opted to stay in my own bed, but it just felt wrong. It didn't feel like the bed I've slept in for the past few years.
Guys, all I have to say right now is be careful. I know the new moon is coming on soon, and I don't want you guys to end up hurt or dead.   Also, Holly, be careful the next time you meet up with Lucifer. He seems somewhat trustworthy from what I've read so far, and all the lore I've ever read about him seems to state that he doesn't lie all that much. He does on occasion, and I do know that most true Demons don't lie. They may leave some stuff out of their deals with humans, but they don't lie. Angels lie. A lot. Just tread with caution.
Everyone knows that reddit reaches across the veil to the other world just as easily as I'm typing this out. We've all seen the ghost stories :)
What the fuck is in your car with you?! Update us quickly, OP!!
.....and now my eyes are dry....
.....isn't it the three eyed crow?
A) I'm pretty sure it's a continuation, and B) why was it removed? It was a good story.
If there's a chance the treatment won't work, I think you should try the surgery. No one likes to be in pain all the time, and I for one would do anything I could to help the recovery process. I'm willing to put down good money that your insurance would cover this kind of surgery. I say go for it, OP!!
THE BUTTON!!!!!   Yeah, I pressed it. Couldn't stop myself. AMA!!
Simmons. The chick that plays her is fine, and the accent, oh god the accent......

Why is r/Hogwarts private?
I actually started at 24mgs because that's the amount a real cigarette has. It's actually better than the patch in my opinion because you still have the hand to mouth, which is what did me in so many times. The hand to mouth habit is the true killer in smoking, and vaping really helps with that. The patch won't satisfy that feeling, so you're more likely to go back to smoking.
