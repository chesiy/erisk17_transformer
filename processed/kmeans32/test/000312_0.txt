These guys look like human pennies:
"Some shit I'm into: food..."
A terrible font choice turned this photography business into a porn studio.
He's not that much of a failure. I mean he defied the laws of nature when he united the hair on the left and right side of his head. Who's to say he couldn't do the same for the American political system?

I was Theodore from the movie "Her" for Halloween I think I did okay.

This urinal looks like Optimus prime.
