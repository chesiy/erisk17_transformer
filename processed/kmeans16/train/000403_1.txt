One of the best current(ish) runs. I want them to bring Constantine into the mix.
The conclusion released today was excellent. Can't wait to see me.
Well the Mark got zapped up into the sky after leaving Dean. When then see the same zaps hitting the earth where the Darkness escapes from.  Not to mention the Mark was said to be both a lock and a key, so I figure it is gone until being recast.   Rowenna probably just used her time to read other parts of the book to power up.
[Album](http://imgur.com/a/fynBk)  My local shops all seemed to run out of Divinty #1 so had that ordered. Same with The Valiant #2. I really need to remember to add items to my pull list.  Didn't realize the Ant-Man movie Prelude part 1 was already out so got me a copy.  Ordered the Auxiliary Cover for Lady Death Apocalypse #1. Always wanted to check out the series, but never felt like playing catch up. This issue really summed it up well.  Ordered Sandman Vol. 6-9, finally completeing my collection (I already had vol. 10 when a shop had a closing sale). Have five trades to binge read now.  Swamp Thing N52 Vol. 5 came in same order (which I placed 1 week before IST had a massive DC sale T.T) It is an excellent story and can't wait for vol. 6.  Last is Sandman #19. Found at a local shop when I was searching for my favorite issue (#18). It is the corrected version, but is still a very fine issue.
If you can find the album at walmart it will be the clean version. Thats wherr I bought it back in Jr. high amd was promptly disappointed. However going back the the Speakerboxx edited version, it is pretty funny. My copy of Lovr Below was stolen for some reason. . .
On 5, my friend wanted to get high for the first time. So we made a night out of it. He wasn't sure if he was feeling it so I put on Justice Cross over a decent pair of gaming headphones. The moment Genesis started he knew he was high and loved the album even more than before.  On 9, sometimes you might not know you are susceptible to Cannabis-induced Psychosis until it is too late. Know your family's medical history, folks. I used to be a heavy smoker and now I can barely be in the same room as someone smoking.
Dragon Quest 3 has a quick save slot so you can do spurts of grinding when you have the time during the day. This is the only Dragon Quest game where you can decide the class od your party members, so the options of how you want to play is excellent.
I stopped at a gas station in the middle ofTexas off the Pickle Parkway toll road during a 9 hour road trip in middle of night. I bought a monster energy drink. The gas station clerk said don't open that in our parking lot and grow horns now. . .
My main LCS had a closing clearance where they had their entire stock at 50% for cash. I got from them Gaiman's Black Orchid, New 52 Flash vol. 1, HC Batman: Earth One (can't wait for next May to continue it), a Venom Might Paper Wallet, New 52 Redhood and the Outlaws vol. 4, and Larfleeze Vol. 1. I would have got some various Green Latern trades but I was between paydays and short on cash.  At my new main LCS I found a Mint New 52 Static Shock for retail price, which is a steal compared to Amazon and considering getting their other copy as an investment.
I think I busted in her during round one a little bit, before pull out. But during round two and three I pulled out fast enough....I think. Don't judge me it was my first time and no babies 16 months later.  I saved a near-nude pic my college roommate's girlfriend had on Facebook for no longer than a minute at like 5 in the morning. No I wasnt just going through her page. It just showed up on the frontpage, of course I saved it, but then a minute later, as I was contemplating hitting Like, it was gone. Right place at the right time I guess.
I prefer the N52 Red Robin costume to the old one, but of course I first saw him in N52 before I read anything older so I kight just be biased.
I didnt have the first two issues for the longest time, but still had it on my pull list, so about a month ago got them and binged read 1-7, a most excellent story and I like how they short of give a shout out to the Future's End weekly when they mention the island that had over 90% of superhuman DNA
Heads up, get ready for some pretty big feels with this title. I actually cried a little in volume 3, and got kinda sad in some of the others. Still need to read the last  5 trades and the select single arcs trades.  The Deluxe Death Trade that collects all her stories in one is a decent related title at a good price. And After volume 4, it would be a good time to start the Lucifer trades if you are interested in how his story continues.
Put it in his face get that shit understood!  I was thinking something by TumTum, but this one reigns supreme.
On the flipside generic canned ravioli is just as good as the name brand and you can get a bigger can for the same price as a regular one.
