That is pretty cool
Hey I know this is an old thread but would that be a decent place to discuss getting into that sort of thing. I want to do some game dev, even as a fun hobby but it's very overwhelming when you look up how to start this. Some first hand experience would be cool to talk to
Buying a Magnet in Newy   Hey bit of a random request but does anyone know where I could buy a magnet from in Newcastle.
Damn. It's a frustrating problem hey because you can't just get in and defrag it or something.   If I find a solution I'll post back with the details.
Give Adamstown and Kotara a look as well. Decent affordability and they are smack bang in the middle the 2 main shopping centres. Plus only 15 Min drive from the beach.
This is how I feel after recently graduating
That's awesome. Thanks for the help guys,  appreciate it.
I would watch the hell out of that team

It depends on your mood. I saw Fury  last night and it was epic. The action scenes in it are unreal. It's a good emotional movie that make you feel for the main characters.   However if you want to laugh then 22 is a pretty funny movie that I reckon is up there with the first one.

This is an interesting invention
Yeah its a really great place. They don't have the range that Kings have but whatever they don't have they happily order for you and it gets here pretty quickly.  And the Owner is a bloke named James and he is super talkative but a really nice guy.
Comatose Cleanliness
Is that a chunk error or did you hollow that out?
UoN game of Humans vs Zombies   I remember a couple of years ago that there was the possibility of a game of Humans vs Zombies to be played at Newcastle Uni.  I seriously want this to be a thing and would love to get it running.  Anyone keen?

It stands for Red Vs Blue. It is a Web series made entirely using Halo by a company called Rooster teeth. Really funny show, they have 11 seasons out with a 12th on the way.

Seems Tasty
Go to the post office to get money out, you can get absolutely any amount out and they don't charge you a withdrawal fee like the ATM's there if you're not with that bank.
The pizzas are pretty decent as well.
You can always check out the brewery.  Plenty of stuff going on there.
