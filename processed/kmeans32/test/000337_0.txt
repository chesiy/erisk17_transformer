That's funny.
Thanks.
Cheers.
I'm going on four years, and I think I've finally got the hang of it. I only have less than half of the heroes, but they are all leveled up.
Oh, my bad.
It wasn't placed under the trapdoor until it was needed, when the other professors set up the other tasks to get to it. That was one of Dumbledore's more genius ideas if he did say so himself.  It's my idea that he knew it was bad for both himself and Harry.
Don't forget the summer between 5 and 6 when he was fool enough to put the ring on to see his family again. I believe he was very weak when it came to the mirror.
By the time I made it to jr high, they had the stirrups that were sewn into the sock, and were just lines up your leg.
All good.
It's in the hospital wing after the tri wizard tourney. When Molly was at Harry's bedside and Albus knew that Voldemort had returned. He sent Snape to Voldemort, sent Lupin to the werewolves, Hagrid to the giants, Sirius was revealed as innocent, he regrouped the order and he did all of this within hours of Riddle's return.  Not to mention, Harry got the first hug that actually felt like it was from a mother.
Or people who adorn themselves with leaves and shit. I've been smoking almost 23 years, and I keep it to myself. You might describe my appearance as "stoner-like", long hair, goatee, comfortable clothes, but no one that doesn't know me would think I'm a smoker, because I am well spoken and if I do say so my myself, fairly intelligent.
Yea, but not this one.
Always scope, never hope.
Meh...
Harry wasn't a true horcrux, this is BS.  EDIT: Horcruxes require a spell beforehand, and they are heavily protected by dark magic, none of this happened when the part of Tom Riddle's soul attached itself to the only other living thing in the house. The damn cat must have been out hunting.  EDIT2: You can downvote all you like, but She has stated this herself. Harry was not a *true* horcrux.
No. I don't even remember the time I was out.  I was dead for about 45 seconds due to an allergic reaction to the MRI dye.
I love to tongue punch a fart box, especially my wife's.
Everything was cool, liquor, bud, cheeseburgers, then these two bitches started texting the same guy. He showed up at the party, then he was coaching one of the crazy whores on how to beat the other one's ass.  It's a shame, but it's survival of the fitness boys.
How about you just don't drink yourself into a stupor? That sounds like a plan to me.
I have been called that, but what's it to you man?
I was in second grade, 1983, and we were lining up to wash our hands before lunch which was back by the place we hung our coats and bags. This girl who was not there that day had left her umbrella there the day before.   Long story short, I picked it up, opened it in the queue, as a result I got two firm swats by the blackboard in front of the class.  The kicker was, the teacher's name was Mrs. Slaughter.
What's your favorite running gag?   Mine is the clearing stick. Bring that back because it's fucking funny every single time.
I am a Scooby-Doo fan, and that animated show has been hashed and re-hashed into many different series. There was even an episode in What's New that the animators made fun of themselves in 03 with a "jumping the shark" joke, but has since come back with Mystery Inc. which was a very cool and funny modern take on the gang.  Addendum, I love the Firefly reference. I have not seen one episode of that show, and just recently realized it was a thing.
The bar.
Maggie Smith- given, Richard Harris- RIP, and I'm going on a limb here and say Emma Thompson. I've always loved her as an actress, and she was the perfect Trelawney.  Evanna Lynch for honorable mention.
Indeed.
I'll probably get down voted to Kronos for this, but as all of the best have been cited, I'll offer this bit:   "What I am about to do, it doesn't make any sense, it is a gut feeling. I have no idea what I'm supposed to do. I only know what I can do."
Listen to me, Potter. Your pal Diggory? By your age he could turn a whistle into a watch and have it sing you the time. Miss Delacour is as much a fairy princess as I am. As for Krum, his head may be filled with sawdust, but Karkaroff's is not. They'll have a strategy. And you can bet that it will play to Krum's strengths. Come on, Potter, what are you strengths?   In short, they were all exceptionally powerful.
Okay, I'm going to type slowly..  Kreacher belonged to the *Noble House of Black* and when Sirius told him to "Get out!" Kreacher took that as a command because Sirius was his master and he disappeared over the winter months, remember? Sirius was not very kind to Kreacher and the poor guy was locked up at 'Grim old place' with no one to talk to but Walburga's portrait. Padfoot even said he was crazy in the book.  When Harry inherited 12GP from Sirius he also inherited Kreacher, and that is why Kreacher was silenced when Harry told him to shut up in the chapter you spoke of, *Will and Won't?* One of my favorites.
HOLY SHIT!
Anyone seen Gummo?
