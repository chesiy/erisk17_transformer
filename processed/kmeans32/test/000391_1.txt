But what happened to the noodles?
Witch! Burn Him!
The only thing you can do is be there for him when he asks, and maintain cautious distance when he doesn't.  The loss of someone that close that suddenly can awaken some dormant things inside of a person. I used to be suicidal so if you ever need advice, message me and I can let you know some signs to watch out for. Stay strong, for you and for him.
I mean I get it. I have friends who are crazy about it and that's cool, just not my thing personally.
Bitches love pregnant
Thanks, I appreciate that.
Yeah, wasnt crazy about it. Thanks for your thoughts!
Lol. Much appreciated. Thanks!
Haven't ever heard of that. Will look it up. Thanks.
Oh it has been mentioned. One of the things I was looking forward to when I decided to do this.
I have tried healthier living before, though not to that extent and it didn't help as much. I think if I go back to it with a combination of what I'm doing now, it'll work a lot better.
... no
Ahh, gotcha. My bad.
A double horseshoe?
It will. It can always get better. God I hate saying something this cliche, but it always gets darkest before dawn, (I know, I hate me too) but the fact that you can see yourself happy is a good thing. If you can see it, it's possible. For a long time I couldn't even see myself happy.
Yeah, it's mostly about getting better for me. Honestly just the name made me laugh when I heard it and has been an interesting conversation piece, which is why I did this.
No worries, at my worst I wouldn't wish what I was going through on anyone. Reddit actually helped me a lot in showing me that I'm not alone. If you ever need an ear, we're always around.
That's what I was initially diagnosed with a year ago. At the time it was atypical because I could sleep and find some joy in day to day life. Less so now.
A couple people have said they don't think they'd pull through, but I still say you'd be shocked.   Honestly the stereotypical emo description really works best. It's like you're walking down a long dark tunnel with water up to about mid-shin. It's cold, clammy, uncomfortable at all times and all you want to do is just lay down and not feel that anymore. After a while, that becomes your reality and the cold clamminess almost supplants the concept of the warm blanket. It's almost comfortable.
I read this after another d-bag had called me a faker and didn't read the don't. Then I was confused by the rest of your post. You're the politest troll I've ever met.   Kidding aside, thanks a lot, I appreciate that.
INCEPTION
You're absolutely right now that I'm rereading it. Either the psychologist told me the wrong thing or, more probably, I mixed up some of what he was telling me. Thank you for pointing that out, I'll get clarification on my next visit so I don't sound like an ass.
BEES?
If you'll allow me (x-post)   You have no reason to care about me or my life and if you aren't in the mood for a long read, by all means skip this one because there won't be a tldr. Reddit, I don't get it. I suffer from depression, and have for a long long time, though it was only diagnosed a few months ago. But even with that knowledge, there's still so much I don't understand. A lot of my issues stem from lonlines, which I'm sure is shocking coming from a guy on the internet at 3am. However, I can't figure out what I'm missing. I'm relatively smart, have the ability to make people laugh, I'm overweight but haven't quite passed into ugly. What's the secret ingrediant to finding people that I missed? Did they teach it in school one day that I was sick. I'm not talking about a wife or my soul mate, that will come when it comes, I'm talking about a woman who can spend time with me and say you are worth spending more time with/on. Again I'm not asking for the rest of my life, but I see women all the time in these long term relationships with absolutely retched people, it makes me insane. It's a running joke with my friends that my life is a sitcom but it really is full of stereotypical bullshit that I just don't know how to get past or get around. Which leads to my other point. The loneliness is saddening and crushing and I don't know why. The fact of the matter is things happen at different times for different people and I know I'll find someone eventually, but it's been twenty two years and while I know that mentally, emotionally it's just like this gorge of sadness and desperation that I can't seem to cross. 22 years and not one girl has ever thought to say yes or ask me out on a date. I can't figure out how to get past this or why I need to. My time is coming, I know this. I'm smart, funny, cuteish, and can write fairly well, I know it will get there. But till then there's nights like tonight. Stumbling across pictures of the "almost had it" and just sliding down the walls, and I just don't know why. If you read this, thank you for your time, it means the world.
I was just screwed by my colleges financial aid tacking on an extra semester to school, meaning that I'm going to have to pay an extra 7000 dollars to graduate which may mean more loans as most of my scholarships expire after year four. I desperately need a job, even more so now that I zerod out my bank account to get my car towed and looked at to determine that the timing belt I had replaced six months ago snapped again, and I don't have money to fix it. But if you don't have reliable transportation, most companies are turning you down out of hand. My mentor through college is getting laid off because the head of our department is a jelous territorial cunt who can't stand that my mentor is more talented and well liked than her. This is causing major stress in terms of finding work and is severely damaging her marriage to a guy who has become one of my closest friends. I also recently found out that my grandfather is dying of colon cancer and while he still should have a few good months, probably won't live to see me graduate college, which he would have if this snafu hadn't happened and I was walking in two weeks. No entertaining stories but I could use a pick me up.

I want to start a conversation about the Penny Arcade controversy from the last month.   Please please please please keep this reasoned and cool headed. I just want an actual discussion and finding out what other people think about the dickwolves controversy from the last few months.  How I view things right now.  It was a joke. An off color joke that wasn't meant to offend but was inevitably going to. If you go back and read the original script, it was a commentary on "heroic" gaming culture and there is no conceivable way that it can be read as supporting rape.   That being said, they could have handled the fallout better. They shouldn't have apologize, nor should they have been asked to, and the follow up comic about the matter was perfect. However, pressing the issue just to press it with the t shirt and all of that was not necessary and shouldn't have been done.   When it comes down to it it was a joke, a joke I personally laughed at, and I have had rape touch my life in multiple incidents. If you were offended by it, then I'm sorry but sometimes people are going to make jokes that are going to offend you and that doesn't mean that they are advocating the position that did the offending.   For those saying this issue is done with, what spawned me writing this was going through the back catalog and researching their development for inspiration and I came across timelines and opinion pieces, it's very much not dead.  Just wanted some other people's thoughts and opinions on the issue.
