I'm so over this game, but I've come this far. I have to see the end.
A-Rod hits career homerun 659 in the first inning.   He's now 1 HR shy of tying Willie Mays for 4th all-time.   Edit: The game is nationally televised on ESPN. He should get a few more ABs.
Stoked for tonight. I got a great deal on some great seats through stubhub. Going to get down there early and have some beers at The Yard. I haven't been to a game at AT T in probably 6 years.
As others have pointed out, we probably wouldn't have won the WS in 2012 without him. Given that that was what he was brought here to do, I think most fans don't regret signing him, and that's just from a baseball perspective. He was one of the best people on the team while he was here.
This isn't a genre or artist I'm familiar with but I've heard so many good things about it, so I gave it a spin today. Can't say I was too impressed. There's a lot going on, but nothing stood out as exceptionally catchy. I might have to listen to it again to make a better judgement.
Michael Brown was an asshole. The looters are assholes.  The arsonists are also assholes. OP never mentioned protesters.    There are legit cases of systematic racism everyday in America, but this is not one of them. This is a case in which a man assaulted a police officer, tried to grab his gun, and was killed as a consequence of his actions.
I put chicken breasts, a can of beer and some spices in my crock pot on low for 7-8 hours. That way I can shred it and save some for future meals. I made burritos with chicken, beans and cheese. Just wrap them in foil and put them in the fridge or freeze them.     Give /r/gainitmeals or even /r/gainit a look. They're going to be high calorie meals because they're designed for people trying to gain weight, but people in those subreddits love meals that can be cooked in bulk and eaten later.
Don't let that scare you away.    I'm assuming you know what a parlay bet is, but if you don't, it's a single bet on multiple events. In this case, if the Packers win by 3.5 or more points and the Patriots win by more than three, you win. If either outcome does not occur, you lose. It seems like a reasonable bet to me.    The -105 is referring to the odds that the Packers will win by 3.5 points or more. It's just a way for you to be able to quickly calculate about how much your return on the bet would be. The minus sign means the outcome is favored to happen. The higher the number is above 100, the more heavily favored it is. When dealing with points spreads, the odds are usually right around 100, meaning your profit will be slightly less than your original bet. If the odds say "Even", you will win exactly what you bet. If there is a plus sign in font of the odds, the event is not expected to happen. If something has odds of +115, it means you would win $115 on a $100 bet.
As far as I'm concerned, Vogey cemented himself as a Giants legend last night. Couldn't be happier for the guy either.
Somewhere in the middle of game six in the 2002 WS, I commented about how sad the fans looked. That game and series turned around right there. I'm not doing that again.

Can we get a gif of Amy G getting sprayed in the face? I, uh, need it...for stuff.
I'm betting on a lot of baseball games on Thursday, it's hard to pick just one potd. I'll go with the **Giants/Padres under 6.5**. The Giants have not been hitting the ball well lately and the Padres haven't hit the ball well all year. On top of that, Andrew Cashner is pitching for San Diego. He shut down SF last week. Yusmeiro Petit has been one of the most consistent pitchers for the Giants over the last month and a half.    My other picks for the day are **DET ML**, **MIL ML**, **WAS ML** and, **TB/BOS over 8.5**.
If he had held Belt there, we would have been freaking out on him too. Literally the only way Belt is out at home is if Puig's throw is perfect, and it was.
Depends on what you want to do. For night life, the Gas Lamp, Pacific Beach and North Park are the main spots. The Gas Lamp is even cool during the day and it's within walking distance of PetCo. At night, it's a little showy, but a lot of fun. The trolley runs there, but it stops around 11:30. Pacific Beach is great at night too. It attracts a younger crowd, a lot of bros and hoes. Cabo Cantina will have more 21 year old girls than you'll ever see again in your life. You have to drive there though. North Park is the most laid back spot. It has a super hipster vibe. If you go here, be sure to check out Seven Grand and True North Tavern.    During the day, I recommend visiting a brewery. San Diego has Stone, Green Flash, Mission, Ballast Point and a few others that I can't think of. I recommend Mission. Their Shipwreck IIPA is one of my favorite beers ever. Plus, you can take the trolley to 12th   Imperial, walk there and then either walk or trolley to the game.
Unclinch your bums, guys and gals!
