Incest.
Nice! Too bad it didn't feature the two "controversial" verses of the song.   Was a high wall there that tried to stop me  A sign was painted said: Private Property,  But on the back side it didn't say nothing   This land was made for you and me  . In the shadow of the steeple I saw my people,   By the relief office I seen my people;   As they stood there hungry, I stood there asking   Is this land made for you and me?  Woody Guthrie wrote this song as an answer to "God Bless America", a song he deemed mindlessly ideological. The irony of course is that when "This Land Is Your Land" became a famous and beloved folk anthem, it was without the two controversial verses, so it lost its overt communist message.
I wonder...
Holy. Shit.   ...  Anderson wins the 2nd set as well.
Cheers!
Loved the grin on Federer's face after the play.
Gotta say, your response made me chuckle a bit. I sort of imagine you as Ignatius J. Reilly from 'A Confederacy of Dunces'.   and will change the laws  Well, I'm sure our neighbouring galaxy will do away with those pesky laws of physics for you, no problem. If that does not work, you can always ask the Greek pantheon, or maybe Nicolas Flamel.
The Van is labelled in German though.
Following the woman up to her room after you've already said your goodbyes at the bar doesn't strike me as a particularly good thing. It's misguided at best, creepy at worst.  If by the "good thing" he did you mean that that he didn't try to force her into anything after being rejected, then your bar for goodness is pretty darn low. I'd call that the basest of human decencies.   Regarding "OP is a scumbag wife": OP made it obvious that they're both married. So him trying to get some strange isn't scummy?  As for a partner having drinks with a stranger of the opposite sex, I guess that comes down to what you and your partner have agreed to. I've never found it troubling in my relationships, but I can understand why some couples put it on the "No-No" list.
The point wasn't that he got her drunk, but *that he followed her up to her room* when she left, which, understandably, made her uncomfortable.  Naturally this doesn't make him a rapist, it seems from OP's story that he took the rejection and went away. But she felt creeped out by the episode and she has a right to be. What's awesome about this story is that the hotel employees picked up on him following her and that they then made sure she was okay.
Thought experiment:  Your brother kills himself. You're grieving for him. A few weeks after his death, out of nowhere, he is being accused of being a terrorist by thousands of self-styled internet detectives. They find his social media and just lambaste it with nasty stuff. They also find your twitter and your mom's facebook and write nasty/threatening messages until the internet detectives realize "whoops, we fucked up, nevermind".   No harm done?
You can resign from the council. Voila!
Yeah, I gotta agree.   Hey i made as many as of you hosts so please invite loads of BME women and non-binary people!!  Also if you've been invited and you're a man and/or white PLEASE DON'T COME just cos I invited a bunch of people and hope you will be responsible enough to respect this is a BME Women and non-binary event only... Don't worry lads we will give you and allies things to do ;-)  I think that post is silly but I also think the word "ban" is hyperbole. Safe spaces can be useful tools - just think of women's or men's shelters, support groups for addictions or illnesses(Damn you Marla Singer)).
Twenty bucks says she's Mossad.
I do understand the sentiment even though I suspect it's a bit hypocritical. I doubt that out of all of the mods over at /r/gameofthrones, none has watched the leaked episodes... Well, it's a moot point.  I guess there's just one thing to do: **Whenever you see anyone over in /r/gameofthrones (or any other sub) ask about a place to discuss the leaked episodes, send them a PM to inform them of this subreddit.**   That way only people overtly looking for a discussion are told of this place and the mods over at /r/gameofthrones can rest assured that this sub is only "advertised" to people who want to take part in the discussion.
I agree - sex is an important aspect of a romantic relationship and you're not helping anyone by staying in a relationship with someone who won't/can't fulfill you sexually.
