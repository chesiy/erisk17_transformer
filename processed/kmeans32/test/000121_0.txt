Step Brothers.  I don't think it's *that* funny yet people in my city quote it like it's the comedy movie of the century.  "IT'S THE FUCKING CATALINA WINE MIXER"  Okay...
Hi-Five! did the same thing here ;)
Did "./relaymyhome full" from there and got this http://i.imgur.com/p2h7oP4.png  I'm assuming everything went well and all I need to do is to connect my Macbook Pro w/Retina Display to a LAN Cable which is also connected to my Router while my N3DS is in sleep-mode and I will receive Eon Ticket via Street Pass? :D   ALSO btw, why does Homepass keep turning my Wi-Fi on and off?  EDIT: Going to sleep now. Will reply when I wake up. very tired. I appreciate your help so much. You didn't have to do this. Thank you for everything /u/sirence9
What's with Japan and Upskirts? No one wears skirts where I'm from unless they're doing a play or some kind of western event.
Wait, I forgot. What happened in Supercop? Unless you were referring to the old man with the fake boobs...  I know he grabbed a girls' tits while fighting her in one movie. Wasn't Supercop though.  EDIT: Not talking about Rush Hour either. He was fighting a group of tall black girls.
What do you mean by that?
Happy Cake Day.
Dude, I was referring to Future Barry in comparison to the main Barry. It's obvious the suit has remained the same shade of red, however there's no dying how bright red Future Barry's suit was in the finale compared to main Barry. Don't downvote me for that.
you should of made one of the going home rides into a mini date maybe like lets stop for a drink, food something.   I did, but she said she doesn't eat past 7 because of cutting weight. Went through a drive-thru to get us some drinks though. At several points I did want to kiss her and I felt like it would've been perfect but I didn't want it to be so soon since I've literally started talking to her for like two days.  Didn't feel like I was overtexting her, but the conversation definitely ended short.  I'm seeing her again tonight when I pick up her up for class, should I mention/bring up that text convo from last night? Also, how would you suggest I "fix" this?
So... real?
What I usually do is throw a couple of Roundhouse Kicks to the body have them thinking about that motion. Then, I'd do an Out-To-In Axe Kick which initially follows the same motion as the back leg Roundhouse Kick and then dropping it over my opponent. If it misses the head, it will hit the body. The Axe Kick, in my opinion, is a kick that covers one of the greatest amounts of range amongst all kicks.  I can't tell if Hug is hitting with heel or the ball of the foot, either or - the most important thing, it seems, is after getting the technique down - the timing.  I'm going to be honest and say I spam a lot of Axe Kicks. I'm going to stop using them so excessively in order to heighten my chances of nailing a really good one and dropping my opponent.   Just throwing an axe kick without any strategy isn't going to end well.  Right on. It seems to work well as a jam/cancel/trap attack so I'll try working my Axe Kicks on the motion.
What the fuck.
Yes.
What does OC mean?
Thank you.
Go to a doctor and get scheduled for a circumcision, immediately. I had pinhole phimosis when I was 11 and I know exactly what you're going through. That ballooning of the foreskin and the pain you get when urinating because the urine flows back in since it can't all escape due to the small opening. That can cause bladder infection over time if not treated.  I had pinhole phimosis for two years and it was hell. The firs time I urinated after I got my circumcision was the best feeling in the world, I was so surprised and happy. Urine flowed out so fast and easy like it normally should as opposed to how it goes out slow and restricted with pinhole phimosis.  No, there is no other treatment for pinhole phimosis that does not result in removal or partial removal of the foreskin. You can ask but your doctor will tell you the same thing. Even minor surgery to open up the opening of the foreskin wider could end up resulting in you developing pinhole phimosis once again so circumcision is the absolute solution for your problem, for our problem.  I know life is hard but you have so much to look up to. Please stay optimistic, I know it's difficult but please, take care of yourself.  Go to a doctor and get checked up for your pinhole phimosis as soon as possible.  Best of luck.
Thank you for the clarification, that makes much more sense.

I'm currently starting Stronglifts 5x5. I'm kind of frustrated at my body because I wouldn't say I'm "skinny fat" yet I'm skinny and I have no cuts, no definition whatsoever. My stomach is flat without abs and my arms aren't lean. Not quite sure what I should do because I don't want to bulk because I do Martial Arts and I don't want excess weight to hinder my speed and I don't want to get smaller in order to get cut. Hopefully that makes sense.

I think that the only reason I will watch this show is because Kara is really cute.  [NSFW] [She looks cuter when she's about to get fucked.](http://thefappening.so/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Melissa-Benoist-Naked-02.jpg)
[No Spoilers] Does an alternate costume exist on set?   In the finale and at a few points throughout the season since the pilot, we see the Future Scarlet Speedster in all his scarlet red and white emblem glory.  Do you guys think that costume was CGI rendered or does an actual physical Future Flash costume exist on set?
Cung Le v. Bisping  Le still pushed forward and unleashed a flurry of attacks before he succumbed to his eye injuries and blindness.
Yeah, you're right. I guess I just felt rushed at the moment and didn't want him to get in trouble at work. I'm not saying it's not my fault, though.
The dumb character design for the Robin girl killed it for me along with the whole generic Mutant Gang.  But yeah, I agree the story is good but the actual details were lacking imo.  Hopefully Dawn of Justice is a lot more entertaining and draws me into the story.  Haven't had a DC Movie glue my eyes to the screen since The Dark Knight.
Will he be wearing the mech suit throughout the movie? I prefer the classic Batman costume.   I'm guessing the mech suit is just to fight Superman?
[Spoilers] Why wasn't "All Star Team-Up" what it was previewed to be in the Trailers?   With the Arrow and Firestorm showing up and all that.  The trailer under the title "All Star Team-Up" showed all that.  I was really looking forward to seeing a battle against the Reverse Flash this episode - I even skipped out on a couple other things tonight just so I wouldn't miss it because I couldn't wait.  Not complaining, tonight's episode was cool but definitely not what I was hyped up for.
Would you consider this body type - skinny fat?  EDIT: http://tinymuscles.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/skinny.png
Jon Foo (Asian/White Mix) is playing Jackie Chan's role in the upcoming Rush Hour TV Series Reboot.   Thoughts, opinions?   Imo, once again, Hollywood has changed the lead Asian character to "half-white" in order to appeal to major audiences.    Same reason why David Carradine replaced Bruce Lee as the lead role in *Kung Fu* and the original Chinese character was changed to half-white - because Hollywood cannot have an oriental face playing the lead role.  My only problem with him is he doesn't look Asian at all: https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/rush-hour-pilot-cast.jpg?w=300 h=208 crop=1
Fellow martial artist   redditor /u/itsenzothebaker 's Taekwondo Highlights from Tournaments around the World. (2011-2014)
Does "Sport" Martial Arts training translate to Self-Defense training, naturally?   For example, does the average Judo Dojo address how to defend against a striker or does it just solely teach sport Judo with throws?  I've tried out a Judo/Jiu-Jitsu school once that claimed to teach "Self-Defense" (as many martial arts schools do nowadays) but only taught throws while completely neglecting how to get in position for a throw in no-gi and how to set-up a throw when an opponent is coming in with kicks and punches. Basically, they just slapped on the "Self-Defense" logo on their Sport Judo training.  I've had the same scenario with Taekwondo. The dojang I go to claims to teach "Self-Defense" but all I learned was how to spar under "Olympic Taekwondo rules" which is does not accurately simulate real fighting scenarios.  Do the training in schools that primarily focus on training for tournaments (like Taekwondo, Judo, maybe even BJJ) naturally translate into real life self-defense even if you aren't given instruction on how to do so?  For example, I don't think someone who solely practices Olympic Taekwondo sparring would be very adept in defending themselves against punches or chokeholds.  Another example would be Kyokushin. Kyokushin Karate is a great martial art, but it does not cover Face Punches at all in it's sparring, so how can Kyokushin practitioners be conditioned/expected to take/defend against punches if all they train in is Kyokushin sparring? Unless they're naturally gifted, talented, or have training in doing so, they can't be expected to do so.   Would someone that only trains under "sport/tournament" rulesets be able to effectively defend themselves in a hostile situation?  EDIT: I'm actually considering taking Kung-Fu San Soo which primarily focuses on "No Rules, Street Self-Defense" on the side to supplement my Martial Arts training as all the training I've ever had has only been practiced under rulesets. On the street, there are no rules.
[LoK B4] Has anyone else wondered why Korra's disappearance hasn't been as shocking to the other characters as the audience may have anticipated?   I know Tenzin sent his three children on a mission to find her, but I really thought they were going to have a full-scale investigation ASAP. I realize they were busy with the bullshit Coronation and etc. but still.   In their minds, Korra's still somewhat fragile/in-recovery. So...
