You've probably heard of Inception You might have heard of Super 8 You probably haven't heard of The war game You've never heard of The Face of Another
This is probably going to be the best movie of the year.
Amazing.
Heaven knows what he is gonna do..
Hell yeah!!
Pixar is at it again....
The scene were Matthew Mcconaughey finds out solution and gives clue to Jessica is just too good.
What? Shrek 2 was great. Really funny movie.
I think Pierce Brosnan is the best bond ever.
I wouldn't say its great.But its not that bad.
I agree with you on that.Though it is not number 1 on the box office.But still it has a gross.And its going to increase as the both the number 1 and number 2 films are a bit old now.
Totally agree with you on that.

Mirror, Mirror and Snow White and the Huntsman
It is a bit underrated movie although i think it deserves much more than that.I liked the movie very much.Brad Pitt,Casey Affleck did a great job.The directing was very good too.The concept of narrating the story was great.
Nah.Diesel is not a sword guy.He's all muscle.Looking forward to it.
