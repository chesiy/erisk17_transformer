At some point those conditions could kill in 24 hours.   So if it's going to kill in 48, just wait another 24

EMT here. Cops don't need medical training beyond first aid/CPR. They already fuck up the little medical training they have. Their job isn't to make medical judgement, that's our job. Just like why firefighters cut people out of cars, not cops, there's a places for everyone in the system. Mess with who does what and it's a disaster.  There's literally nothing the cops could do for a seizure. Seizures require drugs that paramedics attend years of schooling in order to gain a license to give the drugs. Best case scenario for a seizure in a crowd- move patient out from the crowd if it is safe to do so, have Medics show up, Medics treat/transport On a side note, if you witness seizure, time how long it is and move things out of the way so the person doesn't get hurt.
It's interesting everyone's picking those pac games. We should've have beat UCLA last season if sefo spiked the ball, OT against Cal, I think 500 yards against ASU which was more than them. I would say we win 1 of the WSU OSU games and one other  You're also missing a game, we play 13

Completely unbiased here.  The Nebraska common opponent doesn't work here. CU played in Lincoln, GT played neutral field.  I'll keep my overall argument simple, all voters knew about the 5th down and clipping call. That is the biggest arguments against Colorado but don't hold much ground when voters knew about it. Colorado only lost the coaches poll by 1 vote. They won the AP by very many votes. Colorado had a harder SOS as many other people here will discuss. If we emphasize conference play then Colorado wins at a perfect record where as GT tied North Carolina.   Edit- for SOS Colorado played 7 rated opponents to GT's 3.
Good for you. It's about more than the bucks. It opens the door for NHL to add a Milwaukee team, concert events, and overall entertainment. Milwaukee has nothing in the winter months and even summerfest is losing appeal. Milwaukee needs to modernize
Must be an old review for Colorado, they brought back beer gardens last year. This year we have a brand new rooftop terrace on top of the new addition.  [Tickets to the rooftop sold out in hours] (http://bsndenver.com/around-the-herd-7715-shouting-from-the-rooftop/)   I was hoping the review would be something more along the lines of it being hard to breathe, and not because of excitement   Edit- not a one star review but I enjoyed this one  "If you judge a stadium by how good the football team is, then Folsom Field will not be the place for you."
I have a hard time believing that will come up with the [$400 billion] (http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-total-amount-spent-per-year-on-university-tuition-in-the-United-States) needed. Plus, people will find a way around it. People will follow the path of least resistance. I won't even get into the other consequences of free college because that's not what this posts is about
Colorado won nationals in 2014. They had two plays on ESPN top 10 but I can't find the video now
Fellow tall, I've put on 30lbs in 6 months. A good amount is fat but I was so skinny I didn't care. I'm not even skinny fat so the weight looks good. Just lift a lot and eat a lot, worry about muscle tone later unless you get a huge gut
How convenient it happened the year we don't go to the desert. Conspiracy theory- XJ didn't want to leave CU without a win at Arizona   Plus Colorado died with Dinwiddie ACL
