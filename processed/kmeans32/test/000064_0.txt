**GIVE THAT MONEY TO DIRK!!!**
damn
Those seem kind of like filler words that don't really mean anything.  Maybe in his era, doing what you love could keep you happy and fed, but rarely is that the case today.
oh
Ahh thanks for being a decent person.
As a former muslim, I can confidently say that Islam is exactly like that.  There is a very popular hadith that pretty much itemizes how one gets into heaven.    First, you have to physically and outwardly be religious. If you can't accomplish that, you must at least be inwardly religious and god fearing. If you can't do that or are another religion, there's still hope!!  All you have to do is believe in the one-ness of god, regardless of what name you call him by. If you can't accomplish this, perhaps missionaries were unable to reach you with the holy message in time, then you can still get into heaven.  All you have to do is have an ounce of goodness in you. (pretty vague, right?)  So, not so unique, eh?
This is fucking solid.  Now, to get more attention to it, put it in an imgur link and post it to /r/funny, because that's where non funny stuff goes for attention.
Every decent dynasty league will have him on someone's roster.  Unless your league is shallow.  Hell, in one of my leagues, if a veteran is on the last year of a contract, his secondary receivers get picked up.
You have no idea what he's talking about because he's trying to use big words and getting them wrong.  Apprehending =/= comprehending.
Here is a breakdown from urser /u/twewy  [Dude, that opener + combo was a work of art. Right feint, left ready, sees the guard go up, shoves the left in there, follows it up a combo to make sure he can't afford to put his guard down, right hook, left hook, right uppercut, left -- just kidding! Right hook. Change it up, make your opponent frustrated and impatient. Tattoo man wants to look, he wants to peek, you don't take six hits blind with nothing to show for it. Ben waits for the peek, and shoves another left in there, this time an uppercut, following with an opportune right hook to take advantage of the weakened guard as it moves inward, over compensating for the uppercut that was just received. Tattoo man realizes his mistake, and solidifies his guard again -- but wait, we've seen this pattern before! You don't win fights in a ball guarding all day! Ben's been building this guy up. Tattoo man hasn't gotten a single SWING out, let alone a solid hit. Ben knows he'll want to make a move soon, so he pauses, just for half a second. Where previously he had driven half a dozen punches in to make sure no room was given, he waits this time. Ben knows the timing perfectly. Tattoo man takes the bait, there, the guard is dropping, right arm is swinging back, this is going to be big, but fatally slow to start! Ben's faster, he already sees how this will play out. Duck and weave, quick left disrupts the knock out haymaker, veers it off course, and the motion he's practiced thousands of times puts him under now-wild right. Tattoo man hits air, can't adjust his momentum, he's vulnerable, he's open! Bam, right hook straight into the jaw, lights out. Insurance left misses, target's already down. TL;DR Ben's a cold-hearted, calculating bastard.](http://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/2xzs0z/how_acting_tough_can_get_you_knocked_out_in_20/cp50xkj)

Chris Weidman's freakish reach   78"  I think this might be the factor that gives him his greatest advantage over his opponents in the middleweight division.  His reach measures a ridiculous 78", which a lot of heavyweights don't even have.  Similar to Jon Jones, he is extremely successful at using his freakish body to keep people away.  No one in the MW even comes close.  Hell, even Cain Velasquez only measures 77".  People clamoring on about how Machida, Mousassi, and Belfort will destroy this guy seem to forget what JJ did to two of those guys (And I'm a diehard Machida fanboy).  Will Weidman have the same success as JJ?  Who knows.  Jones' greatest asset is his intelligence in the cage and his ability to adapt to opponents mid fight.  Weidman seems to be able to do that so far.  His striking still looks weird and sloppy to me, but he's got a fantastic coach that is continuously refining that aspect of his game.  His wrestling prowess is already known.  The only unknown seems to be his submission game, and like Jones, we haven't seen him in a position to be submitted yet.  Am I talking out of my ass?  Who knows?  Probably.  But does anyone else think that his incredible genetics will keep him at the top for a while?  Why or why not?  If I'm making a stupid argument, please break it down and call me a noob or whatever.  But until someone convinces me otherwise, I'm hellbent on believing that his 78" arms are gonna hold on to that belt for a little bit.   I'm not saying that reach is everything, but Jones' dominance stems from his ability to use it effectively, and so far, Weidman seems to be learning from JJ's sucsess.  Anderson Silva's reach was also a ridiculous 77.6".   Cain Velasquez: 77"  Cigano: 77"  Travis Browne:  80"  Bigfoot:  82"  **Jon Jones: 84"**  Rashad:  75"  Phil Davis:  79"  Gus:  79"  Glover:  76"  **Weidman:  78"**  Machida:  74"  Belfort:  74"  Mousassi:  76"  Jacare:  74"

Question about USA's "Graceland"   Is this the USA network's attempt at a gritty corrupt cop drama like FK's "The Sheild?"  Because if it is, I don't think they will succeed.  If they want to stick to their USA formula for dramas like Burn Notice, and Cover Affairs, they'll be alright.  But trying to go gritty when you have no clue is just unwatchable television.  A lot like TNT's failed cop drama two years ago with Dylan McDermott called "Dark Blue" or "Deep Blue" or something like that.

I've been told that posting articles about Islamic related violence against women is offensive.   I haven't been contacted by mods or anything like that.  Just some political correct and oversensitive "just a few bad apples" religion defending types.  I do this to highlight the backwards culture that I was raised in.  As an exmuslim who's lived in Muslim countries, I have more experience with Islamic brutality and injustice towards women than most.  If political correctness demands that we never say anything negative about Islam, then I will stop posting here.

This subreddit is starting to suck....   It used to be that in order to be best-of'd, someone would be providing some great insight into an unknown subject matter for a curious redditor, or some great act of kindness that went unnoticed.   Now, it just seems like every pun thread, or even slightly funny joke gets posted here, as if the OPs want credit for finding some hidden secret of reddit that no one else on the entire internet has seen.  But I guess such is the say of reddit.  After seeing the downfall of Insanity Wolf, r/WTF, and r/trees, we shouldn't expect anything less.
With all the shifting in the LHW division, where do the top Strikeforce guys fit in?   Gegard Mousasi and King Mo come to mind.  I remember a few years ago people were talking about a Mousasi-Machida superfight.  Would that kind of fight be beneficial to both guys?  What about King Mo?  Being a former Strikeforce champion has to earn some cred in the UFC, right?
