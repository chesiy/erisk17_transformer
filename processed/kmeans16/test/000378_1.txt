Philadelphia Warhammer enthusiasts?
Dude I don't even know, it was two tabs of the strongest doses I've ever taken. None of my dealers have known about the doses so it's always been hard to say. I remember just looking around me and since I couldn't see anything it actually helped me to just focus on what I was thinking and I was kinda just like "I can't see anything... Well fuck." Haha
[ID Request] Found near tree root in Eastern PA, light rain. Looked at list of local mushrooms but doesn't fit any description to me.
Want to try the "Helium Hood" method
Good old role playing
Dammit, we need lamps
Does the rice really work that well?
I am so sorry.
Lots of people will tell you "Just go outside, it's way better". While being outside is incredibly enjoyable, sometimes people's interests lie elsewhere (Like myself) and that's okay. Do what you wanna do.  I'd definitely recommend Enter The Void: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKRxDP--e-Y  It's completely first person, which makes it very cool to watch when tripping. You notice his eyes blink, you hear his thoughts, his voice is even muffled as it would be when you hear your own voice. It's cool. He's a trip junkie and he takes DMT, then he dies and you journey through the after life and observe the past and future of the lives you left behind. I think everyone should see this at least once during a trip.  A chiller movie I'd recommend would be Disney's Fantasia. Definitely a beautiful thing to see during a peak.  As far as games, I find that roaming around in GTA can be funny and just odd at times. Hotline Miami is a very colorful game, really tailored for tripping. Another favorite would be Destiny. Also very colorful aha I'd suggest more based on your tastes if you'd like, I'm just into anything pretty much.
Yeah, I imagine it'll be hard with 2-3 tabs. But I also love puzzles and when I trip I can just figure them out a lot easier. Hotline Miami is really like a puzzle game, in a sense, so that would be cool. The fast paced aspect could go either way, sometimes I can focus really well but if I'm tripping hard it'll all be really blurry. I'd still like to try just for the story aspect alone.
Yes! I'm a heavy gamer too and I have very different tastes when it comes to me and my friends. Gaming and tripping go together like PB   J for me and when nobody else is enjoying it it's like "Ugghhh really?". I completely agree with the 60's culture thing. I think I've gotten a much better understanding of the whole mindset of that culture and it's really great. I might even go as far as saying I'm turning into a little bit of a hippie myself haha Also taking into account that Death Metal is scary for me to listen to when I'm tripping and that's a lot of what I enjoy sober D:
Yeah that's another reason why I'm really liking this subreddit. Lots of like minded people here, I've seen plenty of titles that look like they've just been extracted from my mind written by trippers. In regard to babysitting them, yeah, old real quick. It's a waste of a trip sometimes and I value that time since I never know when I can experience it again. Solo tripping is fantastic but at the same time I want to tell people my thoughts haha It's a cruel irony, it's the one time I like telling people what I think.
Ahh the first time. Everything is a wonderful surprise.

DUDE, I was heading into the theater with my ex when this came out. I had four tabs in my pocket... This chick... said "No, not in public."  As soon as the opening credits rolled, I was like "Yup, I should be tripping."  That's what you get for being whipped I guess...
