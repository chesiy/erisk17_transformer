Just saw a Facebook group: "Hi, I'm a bra. I touch your girlfriend's boobs every day... Jealous yet? ;D"  Joke's on them, my girlfriend doesn't need a bra yet.

She just sent me this in reply to you - " I don't know how to cut the hair of a fidgety pig. We have two restless piggies, but they both have short hair so I haven't needed to cut theirs. Blob (the longer haired one) just sits still. Could try putting the piggy on a table and distracting it with a pile of grass while you trim the hair. Just be really careful of nipping the feet, ears and their bits and pieces below.   I just used a pair of sharp scissors, but apparently proper hair cutting scissors are better. You can get these 'scaredy cut' scissors for easy (and non-dangerous!) grooming....  http://www.scaredycut.com/"

Arcam Alpha 7, Award winning CD Player. Needs a good home!   I'm moving house soon and have to shift some of my audio equipment, this CD player is in Mint condition and comes with all the original packaging and the remote control. The only reason I am posting it here is because I would rather it went to a home where it was appreciated and set up with the right kit to get the best out of it.  So if anyone is interested make me a reasonable offer. Thanks guys.  http://imgur.com/a/B6xtJ

Thanks for all the great responses guys. I think setting up my own business would be a bit too extreme for me. I think the non-immigrant "b" approach with the visa runs sounds like the best idea. Maybe getting a TEFL before I go out is an idea. Or I could work illegally??
