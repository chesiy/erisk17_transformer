Darlene doesn't look at Mr. Robot. She rolls her eyes in that direction while still looking at Elliot. And remember that when Mr. Robot cuts off one of the guys, if the theory is true, then it's actually Elliot cutting off the guy. The lady you are talking about is just looking towards the right. She is not looking at Mr. Robot.   But putting all that aside, after the comments made by u/Bear__Jew, it might be true that the writers are just trying to fuck with out brains. Mr. Robot might after all be real.
Is this him in these scene's ?  http://i.imgur.com/zCjLDHW.png  http://i.imgur.com/fdRtaI2.png
Look at Darlene's eyes when she is talking. She is looking at Elliot, and not Mr. Robot. Here's another one, when she is asking, "What's the plan?" : http://i.imgur.com/UlcnkHI.png You can watch the scene again to make sure. It's kinda obvious now.
Reddit Is Revolting
I also have that doubt. Tyrell has a good understanding of Tech. He is smart. He already knew Elliot's name. He doesn't say anything about Elliot's switch of files. And he invites him to the board meeting. Even if he is not an imagination of Elliot, he probably does have some significance in his life.

I'm willing to bet that if Psy makes a new catchy enough song, it would get into the top 20 most viewed videos.  Also, Taylor Swift. 2 videos in top 30 within 9 months. She's doing something right.
How is the world going to end?
Lets just make different version of the original video and post it to r/videos. We can make this a thing #ShiaLaBeoufSpeech
Dude, that was amazing. I subscribed in hope of seeing more from you.
I must be bored too to keep this going, but.. 1. I mentioned milk from cows. Would have been better if you world have read my original comment in the first place. You are taking one single example and expanding it into a debate.  2. We humans still do not contribute to spreading their seeds when we have their fruits.  3. I'm not trying to contradict you. I agree with what you said about hurting and killing animals being unnecessary. The point I'm trying to make is there is more to it than you think. And that, in the grand scheme of things, none of it really matters.
ITT: skeptic people drawing unnecessary conclusions without doing any research. FreeCodeCamp is not a spam, it's legit. There are no bots in this trend, just people who are not so regular on Reddit. Go ahead and [read this article by the founder of FCC from a few months ago](http://blog.freecodecamp.com/2014/11/a-cautionary-tale-of-learning-to-code.html).  This was the article that got me and many others started with FreeCodeCamp. And I found this article on Reddit ([r/programming](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/2msdo1/a_cautionary_tale_of_learning_to_code/), [r/learnprogramming](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2muc12/cautionary_tale_about_learning_to_code/), [r/learnjavascript](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/2mknfp/a_cautionary_tale_of_learning_to_code_my_own/)).   And, yes, the curriculum links to other free learning resources on the web like CodeCademy, but we also have the Ziplines and Basejumps and Bonfires for practice, which we entirely built on our own. And we also have plans to build our own learning tools in the future.   I agree the title could have been a little less click-bait-ish, but trust me, FreeCodeCamp is legit and we would be glad to have you as part of the community. :)
