What restaurant? I live in phoenix.
What is my ship doing on trees oh
That makes perfect sense, and I hope it turns out that way. The thing is, I told my psych that I've been depressed multiple times in my life and he drew the conclusion that it was likely hereditary and therefore an issue I was always going to have. (chemical and not environmental) So if I weened off, chances are I'd have to get back on at some point. So, I suppose this is something I need to come to better terms with. Again, I'm not ashamed, just afraid of dependency.
That feels like such a revelation, all the comments here are so completely inspiring and all I can think is- wow, this never occurred to me but you all are right. Thank you seriously this improved my outlook a lot. I'm still getting used to the shiny new issues that have been assigned to me, and every bit of support helps me get a little farther along in the journey (cliche party \m/ ) I'm sure this is how everyone in this subreddit feels and I hope I can help people too
Thank you, my mother is an extremely negative person and although she doesn't mean to, she makes me feel very hopeless. I was nervous to post about this because I didn't know if anyone would care but the response (and the responses I see here every day) give me so much hope.
I cried when reading this but I think it was happy tears. Thank you, this was an immense help
Thank you so much, I'll remember that.

[6]   I have been thinking about communicating thoughts and emotions through feeling with other people, and I realized something. We may never truly communicate and empathize, so long as we depend on 26 letters to hurl our thoughts into open space.
but what was on the back?
what the ever loving fuck
in light of recent events, thank you for this. i had almost given up on the human spirit
