Why not, post.
It does not mean that the the colors and saturation are how you would "truly" see them with your eye.  You sure? It's how wikipedia defines it:  "This means that the colors of an object in an image appear to a human observer the same way as if this observer were to directly view the object"  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_color#True_color
These are basically the main characters for most of the book, but yes, I guess they are difficult names. What I mean is that it's a pretty superficial question covered in the first few pages, which was probably all he read to come up with it.
These were previously at a zoo in Europe, but they weren't breeding so it was decided to move them back to their natural habitat to see if that would get the breeding going.  There's an episode of a show called Last Chance to See (also a great book by Douglas Adams) with Stephen Fry that explains and shows the move.
The Harry Potter movies made almost 8bi, so any of the recurring actors would beat the 4bi.
dialed it out  What does this mean?
Yep, [the guy whom the TC didn't even credit.](http://capybarasthatlooklikerafaelnadal.tumblr.com/)
The user you just linked to is a different one, the one in this thread has an uppercase i as his L, which makes it less impressive.
Euros *per kilogram*. So you can safely be damn sure.
Weirdest thing, after making that post I went in search of it like I've done countless times and actually found it on ebay!  I didn't have an issue number, just [this image](http://i.imgur.com/ZyPecue.png) from the Stephen Fry documentary.   Can't wait for it to arrive, today was a good day.
That's the [National Congress of Brazil](http://i.imgur.com/AfX7k.jpg).
[Here's my Saturn V-inspired build](http://imgur.com/a/VFFax). As you can see, it was pretty tried and true on the Mun, always had enough fuel to make it back. Got me to Eve just by adding a bunch of boosters and one or two small modifications (though that lander was a one-way trip).
I honestly don't think it will be that much more noticeable just because it's green, it's already very noticeable when it passes and very few people have ever seen it.  If you use mirrors, it will only be visible right after dusk and before dawn, just as it is now, hardly a constant reminder.  In the case of a light beam, very few people would see it as it points at them in the night,  you'll still need to know exactly when it's going overhead.  Just my 2 cents...
I don't see how nuclear power can be "statistically safer" than solar power.
You can find them [here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/lastchancetosee/sites/radio/). I listened to them a long time ago, but when I try now I get the message "not available in your area". Hopefully it works for you. I try to get my hands on everything related to Last Chance to See, there's also a cd-rom with all the pictures they took that I managed to get my hands on recently.
