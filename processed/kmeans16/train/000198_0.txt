you find out that 80 degree water (26.6 C) did not show up in lower NC until June.  June is when these attacks started, right about the time the heat anomaly began:   http://www.ospo.noaa.gov/data/sst/anomaly/2015/anomw.6.22.2015.gif   See the dark red spot off the east coast? That heat anomaly has been there for a month now. Bull sharks (and their prey) typically love warmer water and normally hang around the edges of the warm Gulf Stream. The Gulf Stream is closer to the coastline around Florida   farther off the coast on the eastern seaboard. Hence more shark attacks (normally) in Florida than NC.   Fishermen on the original post I made on this sub (at attack 7) are in agreement.
7th Shark Attack off North Carolina, 2 more over the weekend.   And now we [are up to 7 attacks](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/06/29/three-new-shark-attacks-in-carolinas-puzzle-experts-and-scare-beachgoers/). And I see a lot of floundering out there as to 'why'. Pier fishing (been going on for decades) more people (Carolinas has had a drop off in tourism, though) blah blah blah.   I'll show you what is most likely the issue right here:   http://www.ospo.noaa.gov/data/sst/anomaly/2015/anomw.6.22.2015.gif  See the dark red spot off the east coast?  That heat anomaly has been there for a month now. Bull sharks (and their prey) typically love warmer water and normally hang around the edges of the Gulf Stream. The Gulf Stream is closer to the coastline around Florida   farther off the coast on the eastern seaboard. Hence more attacks (normally) in Florida.  Right now I am sure they are coming up to that area of heat and feeding / massing around the southern edge of it, which would be the N Carolina coastline. Y'all are collateral damage.  I posted this to /r/StormComing earlier and thought it would be helpful here.
Not sure if it was the bitching (although I am sure that was a big part of it) so much as the leaving. I'll be interested in the numbers when they come out.
Something like this happened in the early 60's to someones daughter that I knew. But the 2 cops took her around the corner and felt her up.  So the dad, grandpa and a few cousins and brothers went to the station and waited out back for the weasels to get off work. When they came out in their civvies they drug them into an alley and 'gave them the beat-down of their lives'. Along with a threat to do it again and worse.   People are too complacent these days.
Of course you know that a tornado can double back when its bottom is hit by outflow winds from a thunderstorm's core. In this case I believe it had to do with the massive gravity wave to the south east -that generated a strong pocket of localized shear as well.   If I seem wrong on any of this, please correct me. I am always learning.
The ones on high horses were the ones attacking this woman and casting unfounded and unreasonable accusations at her, when she was obviously wronged.  Coincidence? Did you even bother to go read the news articles or [look at the image](http://www.opposingviews.com/i/social/oregon-woman-finds-her-t-shirt-design-sold-target-without-her-permission)? It's exact.   I isolated the design and did a google image compare: there are no designs out there exactly like this besides the one at Target.   And 'it happens' is no excuse when fucking with someones livelihood. Kicking someone when they are already down, from the safety of your keyboard anonymity, is cowardly and horrendous.  It's' also clear to me that the design is copyrighted to her under the electronic copyright act.  Source: I am an Executive Creative Director.
You reminded me of [this.](http://i.imgur.com/WkD6yNt.jpg).  My second toon I made a few months after beta -she ended up being a 19 twink and had her little rogue partner (usually my daughter or hubby at the helm of that one.)  Best story I have is;  "Back in the day, mages had unlimited sheeps on the battleground. You also had set battlegroups and would regularly play against the same players.  One day this Troll was speed hacking (a method where they would dc quickly/repeatedly and lag the game for other players) and we caught him alone in a hut on WSG. So I repeat sheeped his ass in the hut while my rogue partner stunlocked and killed everything that tried to come rescue him.   We laughed ourselves into hysterics.   Next time we encountered him we did the same thing. From then on out - until they changed the battlegroup system, it was game-on between me and him in every bg we ended up in together.
I am not referring to the 'floating dead' aspect. I am referring to the lack of education, regulation and poverty that let's this continue.  Corporate/Banking groups (mostly multinationals now) are spending millions lobbying for low wages, ending the EPA, ending pollution regulations, ending work safety regulations, destroying what is left of labor power, ending supplemental health care, etc.  This is all part of the "Make gub'ment smaller!" movement.  The result of this, if they are successful, is exactly what you see in India and Bangladesh. Very few ultra rich at the top, wholly unregulated (who never see these streets) and masses of people in poverty.  EDIT: If you have an alternate point to make, man up and debate this instead of dv it.

We have been saying: Watch the Ring of Fire. Now Five Active Volcanos in Alaska   http://www.alaskadispatch.com/article/20140613/five-active-volcanoes-keeping-alaska-scientists-busy  "An advisory alert has been issued for a remote  volcano in the western Aleutian Islands after dozens of earthquakes were reported in the area, an early sign of volcanic unrest.   The change means that five volcanoes being monitored in Alaska are now simultaneously active, the most in recent memory, said Matt Haney, a research geophysicist at the Alaska Volcano Observatory. "  Too many quakes from Indonesia to the southern Islands, Chile, Acapulco and volcano related swarms in the Aleutians.   West Coast, US   Japan needs to be on their toes.
