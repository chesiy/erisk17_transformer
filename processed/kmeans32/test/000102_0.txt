The UK's 'Data Rentention and Investigatory Powers Act' ruled illegal by High Court
Reminds me of [Ed Snowden's response](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2wwdep/we_are_edward_snowden_laura_poitras_and_glenn/courx1i) in his AMA.
Not tech related sorry.  If I were to answer though:  * Many rumors, none substantiated.  * Vic was well loved by redditors. Also, [see this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3c5jec/mod_post_the_timer/).  * See previous.  * It's poorly handled, sure, not sure there is a great way to approach it that would make things better.  * No, of course not. They don't have the staff to replace the volunteers. I hadn't heard that one before, but this one is certainly false.
Sorry, been a long day/night. Didn't think it deserved more. But I'll bite..seeing as you insist. Even though it plays off as full retard, but ehh..gimme a sec..
No I didn't..

Our Rules were adopted in consultation with our subscribers, we don't change them lightly. Paywalls aren't an issue that comes up much, but I've initiated a mod thread to discuss. Agreed, they're a pain. There are other non-paywalled sites running the story, or you can google the title and get unpaywalled WSJ article from search links, but I'm leaving this post as it's not against current rules, and at the least will make people look it up if they want to read more. But yes, annoying.
Well I guess it comes down to where we define boundaries in a world of spectrums. Which seems somewhat arbitrary. Lions and tigers can produce viable offspring, and you know the others. There seems to be similar issues between the categorisation and cllassification of anmals and planets. We grow up with a black and white understanding, but it's all really rather grey. Maybe it's a a peculiarity of human nature to prefer things to sit in separate buckets when generally the lines are much more blurred than we're comfortable with. I want Brontosauruses and Pluto! Maybe I'm human..
Mahvellous man that..

This! [Here's a write-up of it.](http://www.containsmoderateperil.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-bbc-radio-adaptation-1981/) I still have original recordings from off the radio when I was a kid, plus the box set I later received as a gift. Fell asleep to it much of my childhood. Best version.   Incidentally, Ian Holm who plays Bilbo in the movies plays Frodo in the BBC radio dramatisation! Hellz, I even learnt to play the [theme tune](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPadfvz05s) on piano..still have the sheet music in a box somewhere. Can't advocate this enough.. ^^^^search ^^^^'bbc ^^^^lord ^^^^of ^^^^the ^^^^rings ^^^^mp3'
