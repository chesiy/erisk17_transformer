'EC' - The faceless silent character from Australian Childrens TV
Plane crash
I'm fascinated by the fact that is has an elevator in one of its legs down to the sea floor, how is this possible? And what purpose does it serve?

Also, what was the purpose of the friggin minigun they had with them in space?
That was a lot more interesting than I expected! Thank you
I guess it was when I was 19, I dropped out of school and decided the thing for me to do was to move, far away, Australia. I was going through a lot of emotional issues at the time and I hoped that moving to another place would help me 'discover' myself in some way. I flew out there on a shoestring budget so I had loads of connections, it was a long trip! I eventually made it to my hostel in Sydney, I remember being completely shellshocked as I lay on my bed, I wasn't the best at speaking to people back then so it took me days before I met anyone, that's the loneliest moment if my life so far.

Fuck it
Just google searched NK subs and it all makes sense now!
This source says NK has 70 submarines, second to US, that can't possibly be right, can it?
pls respond
I'll say, 60,000 deposits! gulp. Thanks again!
Great, advice thanks! The SIPPS combined with ISA sounds about what I'm looking for, unfortunately I'm currently in central London so it will be a long time until the house deposit is sorted!

I still haven't seen anything on the London Riots, I would love to see a film from both the viewpoint of a Rioter   A Policeman.
Thats fantastic
Not to mention how dangerous that can be, literally a hotbox for diseases
