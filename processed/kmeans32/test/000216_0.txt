I am a rider.   But for my car I have a custom bumper sticker I had printed that says, "If I have to look twice, you have to ride nice."   You can go to /r/gore and see all gear all the time and the rider still ends up a slushy.  So... maybe that's why I'm not a dick when I ride.  Dicks die a bloody ripped apart death.     If I have to spend a long time next to another vehicle, I don't hang out in its blindspot... I either drop back or pull ahead and give them a "hello i'm here polite salute".   Many drivers appreciate it and will help keep clearance around me.
Awwww dude!  I fucking LOVED these magazines when I was a kid.  And little science books.  One came with a packet of agar mix.  And it taught how to collect samples and identify what grew in it.     Sometimes they'd have optical illusions and then explain how they worked.     And it'd have a section about rockets.... I mean these things were so fucking cool.   Nothing really like that exists anymore.      Sure I see the ones that are available now, but they aren't the same.. not nearly as awesome.  I wish I still had them... or even knew the publisher or titles.
Many 3rd party dealers offer financing for a fully unlocked device.    Then there is buy now pay later on paypal.     I pay with a credit card and pay off the device over about 4 months and pay less than if I add up   1. never owning the device and changing the software as I see fit.  Samsung galaxy owners just found out about a HUGE hole in the security of the device that samsung had a fix for for half a year.  But they can't get updates past the dumbass carriers.   Security holes are a HUGE cost when that bill comes due.    2. being locked into 24 months of contracts where i cannot switch carriers and bargain for a better deal elsewhere.     The unlocked devices generally support more bands and allow me to switch carriers and still enjoy the full benefits of the network.     And the carrier is not fronting any cost.  That cost is paid by the bloatware companies LONG before you purchase  the privilege to use the device that they maintain control over.  The thing is, you save 200 bucks total cost but you spend that on the contract.   And if the device is 700 new I view this as a 500 dollar loss as I spent 500 dollars to USE a phone...   Where as if I paid 700 I paid to keep the phone and actually have an owners rights to the car.    And not one single auto financing company ever tells you that you cannot service the vehicle or make changes to it yourself, or move to a different state, or refinance the car under a new lender....
My exynos lag never returned.  I use the app switcher pretty heavily.    Chrome slows it DOWN Down down though.     My snapdragon, nothing helped it.  Not turning off talkback... setting animations to 0... nothing.   The difference between my snapdragon and exynos is night and day.    Sure the snapdragon gives me an extra hour and half battery life each day, but it runs like garbage.   I gave up after I exchanged it a second time and still got a laggy piece of shit in return.    This is my last samsung phone.  I love the note 4 exynos... but damn samsung.  WTF!    I would switch to LG but I heard they lock their bootloaders down pretty tight.   Maybe Motorola?  Motorola is like paying a premium price for an upper midrange device.   I don't know anything about how they do their bootloaders now.      HTC got dumb after they released the Rezound.    Nexus devices... ok.. but ZZzzzzzz.  They always seem cheap to me.      Sony is abandoning mobile.   Damn android sucks right now.   Hopefully Ubuntu phone will make gains.  They had a good first attempt.... its not there yet.
Yup.  But, when the dispute is between a woman and a man, the ignorant public will typically judge on the side of the woman.     I don't doubt that more often than not, it was the man that was being overly aggressive... so people just assume that this is the case EVERY-TIME.   I got caught in the trap of that.     As a male I say it's bullshit.   But as a person I just say suck it up and move on because it's a fact of life.  And to remember that an open mind is useless without open eyes.
Me either.  And if I do click I read the headline, photos and captions... then I scroll to the bottom and watch the astroturfers and trolls duke it out on Disqus.  The more extreme or radical the comments in Disqus, the more likely the REAL story is something I should be concerned about. So I then look deeper for information on websites that don't try and sell me one crazy tricks...  Unless multiple reviews of the articles claim it's legit on reddit... I don't bother.  I'm so tired of being disappointed is all.   And the comments on reddit that say it's a good article can't be stupid.  Like "DIS ARTICLE PREACH! CAUSE IT RIGHT!!!"  I coulda stayed on disqus if it's gonna be like that.
So beautiful....   It's also overdue for eruption.  Seattle, Tacoma, and Olympia are dead.   All our crop growing states will be covered in a blanket of ash.   And temperatures will plunge.      It's also [more prominent from it's base to its peak than the 2nd highest mountain in the world.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Rainier#Geographical_setting)  It just starts out at a lower altitude. So it is correct when you hear people say that Mt. Rainier is taller than the second highest mountain in the world.     It really is absolutely massive and you can see it from great distances away.     It will also be the death of us all.
What the fuck are you talking about.  We aren't talking deductibles.  And shit plans have shitty deductibles, and stupid low caps.     So honestly, I don't even have a fucking clue why you're entering the conversation, at this point, with this nonsense.
Well I know of three people that did it from my time working in a shady lending center. I worked there for 1 month and saw 3 people that did this.    It's not a matter of securing the loan, but what interest rate you are willing to pay.   And if you're gonna do bankruptcy then the interest rate doesn't matter.     This is especially useful to people that are fully employed in the career field they were educated in.  So the income they receive is often more in line with the tuition they paid and therefore easier to lend on.     Even if your credit is shitty, you can get a loan.   While I worked there we routinely took 525 credit score.  And one guy, with a 495 score, received 25 thousand at 23% interest rate.     So, you can always find some shitty dirtback lender that loans out.  These lenders are counting on bankruptcy claims happening, because it allows them to do some tax jiggery applesauce where they still turned a profit.     Our company was a child company of Citi.

Doesn't help to have a small fragment lodged in my nerve.   Removing it could mean paralyzing the rest of my hand.... so I just have to deal.     Wanna catch me in a very bad mood?  Add lightning to the mix.    Its like a little electric shock, inside my hand, with each flash.     No doubt atmospheric pressure alters the compression of my tissues, if however slight, and moves that fragment.   My fuck....     And no medicine helps.   Weed can put me to sleep... but I have  to get really fucking high to get any benefit.   So the only time I can use that as a treatment, is when I am not going out in public.     The low THC weed doesn't do shit.
Lol   Ur so angry   calm down.    Edit: you also said not to take things literally whilst taking what I said literally.    That's twice you're contradicting yourself.   .

Yeah, but they don't just shoot once and then leave if there is still killing to be done.
We let the chinese build one tiny island, in waters that belong to them, and look what happens.    Dead turtles.   Hope you're happy.    Edit: /s    for the idiots.
I feed my children to child eating bowls.
LOL "No dude.. I don't want them to tell me what she did... I just want them to tell me what she did."    its a dumbass a minute here in /r/news....
The question is based off false premise.  I will not be suckered into a dogma trap.   *The debate was about the misrepresentation of the Cuban program and the difference between what Americans think "quarantine" is vs. what it ACTUALLY is.*   That's it.  Your further echoing of the misconceptions is proof that people don't have a fucking clue about what the program actually was or is.  Instead, you try and sucker the debate into, "should we or shouldn't we do this in the USA".... when ironically, we do a LOT WORSE in the USA where we criminalize and punish medical problems.  When on the contrary, this internationally participated cuban program did nothing oppressive and instead lifted people up.     So you can try to obfuscate with hypotheticals all you want but THE REALITY of the situation is that no one was oppressed or punished or abused, harmed, or had a gun pointed in their face.   They didn't round up masses of people who had or were accused of having AIDS.  They simply said, "Come to our clinics, get tested, and if positive we will enroll you into this medical program.   No one marched anyone into those government offices with a goddamn gun. And the public saw how well it was working out for people with a disease that kills millions, that people who got AIDS happily walked into the office and got the care they needed.     I deal in facts... not made up situations and dishonest ignorance.     "What if the cuban government used guns?"    "They didn't"   "no dude but what if.... you know it's CUBA"   "Ok but they didn't need to use guns because the patients came to them on their own free will"    "Yeah but if they didn't want to... cuba guns!"    They don't use guns because the people who don't want to participate simply don't get tested in the government clinic.    But who'd not want all that sweet medical care to make sure this death sentence doesn't kill them?   No one.   Which is why it worked and why they don't needs guns, didn't use guns, and had no plans on ever using guns to enforce the law.      *Laws don't need guns if they actually help people.  Because there is already huge incentive to follow the law if it benefits you in some way.*     But who could blame you, you're so used to living under "You can't you can't you can't" USA laws.
I'm not talking about white guys who claim to be rasta.  I'm talking about the core of the religion in Jamaica... it isn't welcoming to whites.  It doesn't regard whites as evil.  [It regards blacks as superior and they will eventually rule the world.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/rastafari/beliefs/black.shtml)    These ideas were developed in part by [Marcus Garvey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Garvey), who is considered a prophet by many rastafarians.     These white dudes in the USA just claim to be rasta because some marijuana is used in some rituals and they think it gives them the freedom to get stoned.    We will see fewer and fewer white dudes resorting to these measures as marijuana becomes legal.  There's no reason for the act anymore.... as if a judge would actually buy the "religious freedom" shit about white rastafarians smoking dope at a Big Day Out concert.
Fucking awesome this second link.   I can just make my own and not even have to purchase the erasers.  I'm sure I can tweak the recipe for better performance.  I'm very picky about my erasers.  can't be too hard or too soft.    This means I can buy my daughter a snack to go along with her trips to the Hand On museum.  And I can keep doing as much art as I want.    I... I didn't get YOU anything.
Hopefully they don't do something stupid like make her VP.  Retaining her voting power in the Senate is much more important.    Bernie is gonna get stonewalled by congress worse than Obama ever did.   Especially if we don't turn out every member of congress that doesn't have a voting record that supports people instead of corporations.
Look pal, its hot in here... I don't wanna talk. I wanna stand awkwardly or pretend to clean whilst waiting for you to squirt your magic freon juice into those tubes and make this work.    If the silence gets weird, I'll just bother you with more crazy stories; about how it used to could and now it can't.
It would hurt... at first.  But all growth comes with pains and investment.   But you're a fool if you don't invest for the long term.  It's the END GAME that counts.   And in the end, a better educated society that leads the world will be better for the stock market.    And it really would not hurt that bad.  Do you know how much fucking microtransactions take place in a single second?  This tax would suck for all of 3 months and then it'd just be part of the game.
Oh phew.   I'm good then. That's what I do.    I thought I had Monsters Inside Me.   Fuck that show really hard.
Dude... Fucking cool it.
China.   Or is it Japan?
If you actually read about him it turns out he did ask for help.  But 50 years ago was the dark ages for mental health care.   Seriously consisting of techniques like blood letting, electric shocks, and shoving spikes into the patients brain....  I'm done here.
From Washington here....   I really appreciate you saying this and hope more people read it.   We've got people (mostly young men) showing up to live in washington.   They don't get that it's supposed to be laid back and chill.     Great... you wanna partake in the legal weed I'm fine with that... but you don't need to stand out on the fucking sidewalk with a 6 foot triple matrix bong and blasting bob marley at 9 am.     I get it...you're stoked to be here.  But can't you just like roll a spliff and chill on your porch or whatever?     Edit:  On a side note, if you do this the cops WILL bust you.  You don't have to worry about getting beat down for a roach is all.  Doesn't mean its a hot box all of seattle time.
Why?  Each amendment stands alone.   The wording of any other amendment has no bearing on the 2nd amendment.      It clearly says "well regulated militia"     That does [not] mean to our forefathers that people need assault rifles with shitloads of rounds in them.   There was no such thing as a machine gun when it was originally written.   To them. a firearm was slow... heavy... and not very deadly in a singular form.  It wasn't until entire miitary units, firing muskets together as one, that they became effective in bringing death.    So you have to think... they didn't write the amendment with the idea in mind that one weapon in the future could kill far more people than 50 men firing muskets could.  They wrote it with the idea that communities could defend themselves without waiting for a military unit that could be weeks away (or never coming).  The idea was that public communities would own and regulate the weapons use... rather than allowing single individuals to build stockpiles of powerful weapons that were in no way managed by anyone other than that individual.   The forefathers were VERY MUCH about preventing any ONE MAN from holding too much power, but that MANY MEN TOGETHER (the people or the public) would hold the power.
Well it's too late for that now.  For all we know the manager could have been in on it... no matter what their gender is.     Regardless, the store is in control of content which could be a legal liability for them.   So why not just delete it?  No proof anymore.  You can't sue when the police arrive and find zero evidence to your claims.     Don't be a weak little shit.  When somone does this shit.  You go outside call the police and wait for them to arrive.  Don't challenge the violator because they'll just delete the pics.   YOu want evidence.
It would be nice if some people from /r/dataisbeautiful could get in on these numbers and make us some visuals.     PRETTY PLEASE!    /me taps gently on his gilding trophy.
