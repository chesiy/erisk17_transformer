wireless headphones i think would be the best option
The title makes it seem like your the victim when it's really your boyfriend or shall I saw should be your ex. You are young 17 years old. But, you made the choice to cheat and you should have to pay with the consequences.

Thank you!
Your not alone and sadly its more common than you think. I know two people that had their fathers die suddenly. It's really hard for them to cope. I may not know what its like, but I'm facing a similar situation. My father has cancer- the one Steve Jobs has. He's at the hospital and theres no cure. Find something to  help you through this difficult time- I bake, watch movies and I cook. I also like to humour people so all those help me through it. You are not alone. I'm so sorry.
Agreed!
Struggles of being hearing impaired   I've been hearing impaired for all my life and I wear two hearing aids. Yes, I'm very lucky to be able to get the care I need, but there are several struggles that I face everyday that many do not. Having a sense of humour helps me through this. I joke when my friends didn't hear me (shocking right) I say that my hearing loss is spreading onto them lol. I also joke that I'm the extra in pitch perfect in the deaf jew scene. I no longer have to worry about what to dress up as for halloween. I just need to be myself!  1- I had a professor refuse to repeat what he said in the lecture (no power points) even though the week before I told him I was hearing impaired. He said if I didnt keep on raising my hand I would of heard it.   2- People tell me that I talk to loud and a recent incident happened when I was sitting outside with friends at Starbucks and someone told me to lower my voice. I can't hear how loud I am and people do not understand that it's not my fault.  3- People think I'm deaf and it's sad that people do not know the difference between hearing impaired and deaf.  4- In loud places, I have a hard time hearing conversations   5- People ask the same questions- can you sleep with them, can you shower/swim with them, if you take them off can you hear, can you read lips/can you read mine, can you get electrocuted? (yes someone asked that)   6- A few years ago, I worked at a day camp. A kid wanted my attention and I talked to her then I went back to listening to the others when I heard people laughing. My co-workers were laughing at me because the kid wanted my attention again and I didn't hear. I hated working there.  I made this post because I believe people need to be more aware of hearing impairement and deaf. So the next time you hear someone talk loud think before you speak. They may wear hearing aids.
Glad to hear!! :) keep skating!

To be honest- its just a theory I'm not sure but from what I got from the ep is The DA or whoever Jeannies friend was saying something like are you sure you want to do this, it will cause trouble etc. Then Lucas got shot? HMMM I think Jeannie might of said something that should of been kept a secret and it end up lucas being killed

Thoughts on Endless Love (2014) remake? (SPOILERS)   So again another friend took me go to see Endless Love. I saw the trailer and I didn't really want to see it as well it didn't do so well on Rotten Tomatoes. The only movie I really want to go see is Veronica Mars, but any how it is not a bad movie. Obviously, it is no where as good as the Notebook or Walk To Remember. It was a cute, romantic movie and the scene where the main female character gets in a car accident scared the living crap out of me. Has anyone seen the 1981 one with Brooke Shields?
50/50
So I just got into House of Lies. Honest truth, there is so much better TV material out there. This is not the best or the worst. It's the entertaining, it takes a while to get into the series. I would watch a few more to decide  if you want to continue on or not because it does get more interesting as eps goes on. Kristen Bell INMO kills it by far then the rest of the cast. There so many great lines in the show worth watching. I say give it one more try
ew
Dont give up, lol i hope
Make sure that she did not sleep with anyone else because there is a slim chance it could not be your baby. You should be supportive and ask what she wants. I think abortion would be the best route to go because its unplanned, you guys are both young, it was a one night stand but its all up to you two.
Thank you, hearing someone else who have been through it helps me a lot. :)
I know how you feel, but the only thing changed about your dad is that he has cancer. I know it's hard and trust me I'm 20 years old and my dad has been having it for the past 3 years trying to find a cure. Last month, we found out that it spread. The only thing you can do is remain strong, find people that you can talk to, I go speak to a lady because at 20 years old my friends some of them don't know how to respond to the shit im going through. Find an outlet to distract you, such as movies, writing etc. It's going to be hard, but it will make you stronger and you're family as well!
Everyone is good at something, you just need to have the courage and go ahead and find it. Maybe you like to write, sing, draw? Find something that you like and you can use that as an outlet. I have been feeling really shitty lately and I love to write movie scripts. If you are barely noticed in the group, you need to tell your friends how you truly feel because if they are you're friends, they should care about you. You need to be honest with them, and if they don't care than I say they aren't your real friends. Quality trumps quanity. You have a girlfriend who cares about you, so I think there must be a few good things about you. I think you should join a club or join something where you can meet new people. It's always nice to interact with new people and possible make new friends. If you're friends make you feel like shit, they are terrible friends. You need to tell them how you feel.
Walk To Remember
I'm not really familiar with Sam's work and this is the first movie I've seen him in lol. I don't think he should win an Oscar, but I thought he had a good performance in the Way Way Back and not many people know about this movie
I saw the movie today with my family including my parents. And maybe this was not the right movie choice to go see it with because there wasn't just one or two there was like 60% sex/naked woman which made it a little awkward plus I was beside my dad watching it which didn't make it any better. It was 3 hours long which was a little too long to sit in a movie theatre for, but Leonardo DiCaprio did a great performance as Jordan Belfort who gets a little too caught up with himself when he becomes richie rich. Jonah Hill was in it, he was alright but I think Leonardo stole the show.
