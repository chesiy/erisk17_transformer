I agree he's probably not serious.  He loves center stage and like he says, he's got all the time and money in the world to be there for a while...he gets to talk about things he wants, and people have to take him seriously...whether or not he's a false flag for Billary, I can't say.  I do think he's trolling the GOP, however
Benjamin Fulford talked a lot about this on his blog 5 or 10 years ago.    Just do a Startpage search for "benjamin fulford new world order putin china brics" and you'll see the articles I'm talking about.  This was planned all along.    But what does it matter?  Unless you're the CEO of a major corporation, or a the head of a Union or something, there's not much you can do and it won't affect you all that much.  I'm assuming most of you guys are young, probably in your 20s, maybe 30s, correct?  I'll be 65 in 2 years and then I'll retire and be on my merry way.  I guess if you're under 30, you'll be living in an interesting time.  You'll be seeing some strange things happening in the market.  Me on the other hand, I'll be dead.
I wonder to what extent was Ellen aware that they were using her as a scapegoat?  She seemed genuinely distraught about the result of all of this.  She replied to my first message, but not my second, which means she's probably quit Reddit altogether, and who can blame her?  I doubt she'll be back.  I didn't read all of the vitriol posted about her, but I guarantee you, even an old fart like me would be devastated if even a percentage of that were directed at me!  As to your comment about her being an Asian and Female, I remember early articles where details about her relationship with a married "black" male were cooked up.  This is meant to light a fire in certain circles where Asians and Blacks should never mix.  To a skeptic like me, this kind of negative press early on set the stage for people's dislike for her, that somehow she was not to be trusted.  Of course they presented no evidence in these articles.  And I prefer to give people the benefit of the doubt.

A couple of them look slightly different, but I was inclined to think that also (hence my title)
Obviously I believe you're incorrect, otherwise I wouldn't have posted it.  I'm hardly a troll.  I think it's a genuine question that a lot of people think.  For those of you who are not aware, 84% of American citizens are religious, something like 79% of them are Christians.  That's 286 million Christians in the US alone.  I guarantee you, ever single one of them is asking this question.  Now you may think they are nuts, silly, or just plain wrong, and I would agree with you generally.  But how are you going to change their minds?    It's a topic worth discussing in greater detail and just removing my post because you think it's "trolling" or "disrespectful" just buries a potentially worth-while discussion in my personal and professional opinion!

Where's your evidence of this?  This ruling has been coming for a few years.
I came to Reddit about 8 years ago from Fark.com  There were only a few hundred people using it at the time.  It was a great community.  I remember when people started comparing it to Digg...that was a huge kerfuffle when that all happened...and a bunch of top Digg submitters created subreddits here and became bigwigs again and the controversy and the naysayers and the whiners... this is just another "thing" and those people who are upset most by it will leave as they did during the last two or three "things" that have blown up on Reddit in recent years.  Meanwhile, I'll stay here, enjoying the site as I did 8 years ago.
aww...that's really nice of you :)  See?  This is the kind of comment that makes friends, not like your bullshit, icecreammachine
eat me you piece of shit.  I've reported you (not that it matters at this point with all the bullshit going on around here).  But you're now on my shit list
My wife is Korean.  We've been married 29 years.  She still can't say "I love you".  She can say "love you", or "i love", but not all 3 words.  She said it's a Korean thing.  I had to teach her how to hug and kiss the children when they were young.  She said her father never hugged her growing up.
a colleague's ex wife lived there after the divorce (for about a year).  She said it's infested with druggies, drunks and old people.  avoid it if you can  If you're looking for affordable, yet not too bad, check out:  1.  Belchertown - yeah it's more pricey now than it was 10 years ago, but just a step down from Amherst.  2.  South Hadley - you can find something foreclosed look on Zillow for the latest.  It's a typical new england town full of rednecks and nimby's, but a nice place to live.  3.  Turner's Falls/Montague - yeah there's drugs up there, also poverty, but it's turning around.  Has a nice artist community and is relatively safe.  4.  Shelburne/Buckland - pretty far from everything, but if you don't care about that it's a great place to live  5.  Leeds/Williamsburg/Goshen - see what you can find for housing.  Sometimes you luck out.  Pricier than Belchertown, but close to Northampton.  Places to stay away from:  1.  Ware/Three Rivers/Palmer/Ludlow   2.  Springfield/West Springfield  3.  Agawam/Westfield  Good luck!

We all were issued a release from the CDC when the outbreak was first announced.  I don't have a pdf of it as it was printed and handed out as part of a packet of UP documents at the hospital.  Also, in answer to your other question: I'm not in Korea, so no.  But it is on the news here in western Mass, which if you think about it, is pretty incredible.  I mean, we're a tiny fraction of the state...yet we get coverage about the MERS situation in Korea.    ------- if the mods are watching this thread, can you find out why I keep getting an 8 minute block on my comments in /r/korea?  I've been a member for a long time.  It's frustrating.
I'm an ER doctor in western Massachusetts (USA).  This outbreak was caused by someone with an attitude like yours.  This man, an elderly doctor, didn't follow universal protocols when he returned from a trip overseas, ignored his own symptoms when they began to present themselves, and was part of a system that preferred to ignore/hide a potential threat rather than treat it seriously.  Is it warranted to say that the Korean culture is largely responsible for this outbreak?  Probably not, but it certainly is a contributing factor.

Gosh...don't know what to say.  I suppose it depends on where and how you use it.  I've found it very useful for conversations with my darling wife and her family.  I don't use it often in public, except when dealing with service (restaurants, taxis, stewards, shop keepers).  Mostly when we're in Korea my wife does the shopping though.
I'm too old.  I really don't care.  I've got 2 more years till retirement, then I don't plan on living much past my 80th birthday, which is in about 17 years or so...  Regardless of what has been said here, and elsewhere, I live in one of the richest parts of the country (Massachusetts) and I don't see any of this "element" discussed here near where I live.  We are quite prosperous, thank you.  And I have the grandchildren to prove it!
Fuck you you prick.  It's douchebags like you that should go down.  You sold a shitbag product and now you come on reddit to threaten you will "escalate"?  Fuck off and die you piece of shit.
creepy dog
I'll be 64 in July.  I've traveled all over the world as a doc with Mdecins Sans Frontires, the last 7 years working as an ER doc in my home town.  I'm married to a very beautiful Korean lady (this is our 30th year!), we have 4 children and 9 grandchildren.  For fun I play music with friends, go hiking and spend time with our family.  Life is good.
Hardly crazy.  Chinese people have a different idea of what's important in life than Americans.  That's really all there is to it.

HADLEY  The state attorney general claims owners and managers of the Route 9 Diner in Hadley knew about but failed to protect female employees from at least a decade of regular and repeated sexual harassment in violation of federal law.
it's an aggragator, no more no less.  You have to be able to read between the lines.  There are very few journalists/researchers I trust.  James Corbett is one of them.  His agenda seems to be fairly open, although I did wonder at the fact that he took a very long time to open up about his personal history/timeline.
OP do you know how government agencies get money for their budgets?  By spending every penny they have!  I worked for the city of Boston in the 1970s.  You could tell a government worker because they would push all of the paper, delay as long as it was legally possible and "hide" whenever they could.  Government workers take the maximum # of breaks that exist, take all of their vacation, and sick time, and know every loophole that exists to keep from helping you or doing their job!  So I'm not surprised to read your story, and I'm positive there's no conspiracy here
Q: What are you waiting for? A: The Collapse   There will be no collapse.  AT least not in the way you imagine it.  It's not going to be like "Dawn of the Dead" where suddenly chaos erupts everywhere, and the preppers grab their bugout bags and go in the woods.  The ongoing zeitgeist that one day lightning will strike and the proles will rise up is another method of control.  It's far more insidious than that.  Read "The Hollow Men" by TS Eliot and you'll understand.  You'll just notice that every day things will become a little more expensive.  Prices will go up and down, but this constant will always remain: you will need to work longer for less and less.  Young people finishing college will be told at their graduation that "The only way to the top is to start at the bottom," only to see the bottom get lower and lower every year.  Job security will cease to exist as a concept.  YOu'll notice the size of houses and apartments will begin to shrink whilst the price of housing rises.  More and more it will become challenging to find food that doesn't taste rather bland.  You'll see your friends and family less, and one day find that doesn't bother you much.  Marriage will become rare, as will children.  People will begin to indulge themselves in digital fantasies, never actually experiencing the real world.  The modern human will have no religion.  No dreams.  No desires or wants beyond the immediate sating of his bodily desires.  No beliefs beyond the arithmetic (and even that will become a grey area).  One day, still many generations from now, your descendant will walk into a voting booth, and there will be a single choice for him to checK: "Yes."  And every day he will be told from the moment he wakes up to the moment he sleeps, "You are stupid, you are ugly, you are weak.  But together we are free, prosperous, and strong."  That is the true nature of the collapse: the reduction of the modern American man to a feudal serf, incapable of feeling love or hate, and unable to recognize his own self-worth.

Incoming coup d'tat in the United States?   Has this been in planning since Obama was elected?  Just recently there has been a huge political push to overthrow the United States government by its own members, and high ranking members of other nations. Obama has "failed" the military industrial complex by recalling troops from the Middle East and by not sending in troops during the "Syria chemical weapons" debacle, and Obama has "failed" Israel by not being more firm with Iran. Saudi Arabia is at risk of being exposed as a direct financial supporter of the 9/11 attacks, and Rand Paul had a speech about how Saudi Arabia is no longer an ally of the United States.  Netanyahu has been working directly with members of the US congress in an effort to overthrow Obama.  http://nypost.com/2015/02/18/bibi-why-im-speaking-to-congress/  "Why am I going to Washington? Because, as prime minister of Israel, its my obligation to do everything in my power to prevent the conclusion of a bad deal that could threaten the survival of the State of Israel. "  This means that Netanyahu doesn't believe Obama is working in the best interest of Israel, so he's working directly with members of congress to ensure that something happens to change that fact.  Rudy Giuliani, who was in on the 9/11 attacks, has directly attacked Obama http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/19/politics/rudy-giuliani-obama-america-love/  Rudy Giuliani: Obama doesn't love America  Giuliani, a lapdog, has been making a big scene about Obama. Conservatives love Giuliani and believe everything he says.   Giuliani states that Obama was influenced by Communists http://nypost.com/2015/02/21/giuliani-obama-influenced-by-communists-since-youth/  Rudy Giuliani doubled down on his claims that President Obama doesnt love America in an interview with The Post Friday  claiming the commander-in-chief has been influenced by communists since his youth.  DHS intelligence report warns of domestic right-wing terror threat  http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/19/politics/terror-threat-homeland-security/  They're carrying out sporadic terror attacks on police, have threatened attacks on government buildings and reject government authority.  The DHS was given unlimited power after the events of 9/11. Saudi Arabia has been linked with al-Qaida and the American public wants the "missing" 28 pages of the 9/11 commission reports to be declassified. Netanyahu has stated that 9/11 was very beneficial to Israel. These entities are trying to overthrow Obama and take control of America. Expect a false flag attack in the coming weeks, if not sooner. Afterwards the DHS will launch their plan to incarcerate any that oppose the coup.
