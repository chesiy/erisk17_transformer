I've stayed at the Munich Novotel. Great place.
It's timely because the current web trend is "thin is in." I'm doing a fair amount of that but I am careful with the contrast. A lot of websites are using 70%-ish gray thin sans fonts for body copy and I struggle to read it.
I disagree. Scott Ritter, who was an UNSCOM weapons inspector in Iraq, was travelling throughout the country and all over the news prior to the Iraq invasion telling people that Iraq had no WMDs and no capability to make them. Congress knew (or should have known) that none of the 9/11 hijackers had any relationship to Iraq. The yellowcake story and subsequent attempts to link Iraq to 9/11 by the administration had already been discredited (look up Joseph Wilson and Valerie Plame).  If somebody voted in favor of authorizing military force against Iraq in spite of all of this, then it's clear evidence of a failure of leadership.
I'm sure there are things about him that you wish were better. Maybe better abs, pecs, ass, hair, a bigger dick.  A relationship goes through these stages. At first, you are completely blind and see nothing but perfection. Then you see an imperfection, then a few more. Couples that make it through this stage find ways to accept their partner's imperfections and that is exactly what defines a successful LTR. It's not easy to do but that's also why most relationships fall apart.   I think it's healthy to get these things in the open but talk about the fact that nobody will be a perfect fit to their partner's ideal but as adults, can you find acceptance with each other's perceived shortcomings.
No, it just means American voters are dumbasses, but we already knew that.
Others have given great advice and recipes. I'll just tell you my story. The first dish I attempted for my wife as a noob cook was blackened salmon out of a recipe book given to us as a wedding present. Disastrous, as in smoke-alarms-going-off disastrous. She still loved me and appreciated it. Fortunately, I got better.
$1.4M is not really that much gold at todays prices. This guy was probably a courier for one or two high ranking government leaders and was just going to trade it for cash. Because of economic sanctions, North Korea has very little foreign cash. You need cash--like U.S. Dollars--to buy/import foreign goods. There are people who will sell you anything--Mercedes, Fendi purses (popular with the first lady), Armani suits--but they won't take the North Korean Won.  The reason why he got caught is because he didn't make any bribes or didn't bribe the right people at the airport. Arguing diplomatic immunity won't get you anywhere but if you slip enough money into your passport you could get almost anything through customs in a 3rd world country.
All celestial bodies except black holes emit radiation. That radiation is comprised of many frequencies depending on the matter that it's made of and it's not hard to figure out what those frequency components are. When bodies are moving relative to each other, those frequencies get shifted slightly due to what's called the Doppler Effect (think of a train passing you and the noise it makes as it's approaching vs. traveling away). The faster they move the more the shift is. By looking at a spectral graph of a celestial body we can calculate the speed at which it's moving away or towards us from that shift.  There is no true speed, only speed in relation to a point or another celestial body (such as our Earth).
Thinking about it more, I think the answer is this:  You are right, but the only place where the forces count is right at the mouth opening, not at the tip of the noodle. Where I got stuck is thinking that because the noodle is a cylinder, the pressure can only act on the end of the noodle. But in actuality, the pressure is acting on the cross section of the noodle right at the lips and it doesn't matter how long the noodle is.  I'm not 100% on this explanation but it's better than anything else I can think of.
I surely hope you don't think hypothetical questions are irrelevant. Political philosophers throughout the written history of mankind have been discussing hypothetical and unreal forms of government. I'm sorry if you don't see the value in doing so.  Regardless, I was addressing "freedom therefore capitalism." My point is that you don't want the kind of pure capitalism that would appear in a completely free state. There are problems in pure capitalism that must be redressed through creating a regulated competitive market and governed by an authority to which we give power to punish. No regulatory body will be perfect because there will never be a set of regulations that are perfect. Regulations, by their nature, are restrictions of freedom which we grudgingly accept to varying degrees. They will hurt some and help others.  jefferey1313 accepts both premises--pure capitalism has problems, government regulations have problems--but could not accept the conclusion that the system isn't perfect. The only way he can do that is by believing that there is a set of perfect regulations that can be administered by a perfectly functional governing body.  TL;DR: Is capitalism problem-free? On one extreme, pure capitalism  isn't desired by most people. So we agree there are problems. Now it's just a matter of drawing the line to balance regulation and liberty.
I am really not a defender of cops. I just wanted to bring up the fact that we all suffer from cognitive biases. I actually think that the profession attracts a certain kind type of bullying personality. I certainly agree that police should and must be prosecuted and punished when there is evidence that the activity was illegal and premeditated. I think police departments should fire these kinds of cops when they find disturbing patterns of behavior, before it becomes a PR nightmare.  Police also just screw up. I'm glad I don't have a reporter calling me every time I write a bad bug into my code. This is something we also should be aware of. Then there's all the hazy area. Police are asked to make very tough decisions that could be life/death and make them very quickly. When I see one of those, I'm just thankful I don't have to be the one evaluating it.
When the only thing you hear are stories of people goofing up, you're going to think that it happens a lot more than it actually does. It's a proven cognitive bias and it's something that you should be aware of because you (yes, even you) are susceptible to it. In order to make rational evaluations of the community in which you live, you should be aware of the ways perception can let you down. I encourage you to listen to a few of David McRaney's podcasts of "[You Are Not So Smart](http://youarenotsosmart.com/podcast)."   Hopefully this will lead you to explore the topic in greater depth, looking at actual data sets.
The Palestinians did not the start the 6 day war or the 1948 war. They are caught in the middle. First, the country of Israel was just *declared* by David Ben Gurion. There wasn't any treaty between any parties. Western powers in the U.N. voted to recognize it so that it would be a place for Jews to go rather than have to accept post-WWII Jewish immigrants into their own countries. Prior to Ben Gurion, in the area that is now Israel only about 15% of the population were Jews.  The 1948 war and later the 6 day war were ostensibly over Palestinian rights but truthfully were political wars. Islamic Palestinians were the vast majority of the population but they were told by the Arab armed forces to flee the area, which they did. 700,000 of them. Israel won the '48 war and took the opportunity to basically lock the gate. The refugees were not allowed back into Israel (where they and their families had lived for millenia) nor into the neighboring countries and basically were stuck in the west bank, which was taken over by Jordan. Later, after the 6 day war, Israel took hold of that territory as well.  The Palestinians have been fucked by both sides throughout the history of this conflict.
You know, I've asked this question of my friends and I gotta say, this is the best answer I've heard yet!
CharlieKillsRats has the only correct answer so far.  Look at this way:  Imagine you're a widget craftsman making widgets in your garage. You're not in any debt and you make a decent living producing 1 widget a day. Now imagine that you're also a cool dude that has always paid his bills on time so tons of people want to give you money so you can build a factory and hire workers, and they only want a couple points interest because you're so trustworthy. You will increase your earnings 10X, maybe 100X, and you're going to employ a whole bunch of people. You'd be stupid not to take the money.  That's the U.S. economy to the outside world. Except they are willing to accept as little as 0.22% interest (that's actually the 1 year t-bill rate right now).  The difference between countries like the U.S. and Germany as opposed to many other "first world" countries is that the U.S. actually does a great job converting debt into production. This encourages more people to invest, which accelerates the productivity, keeps standard of living high and interest rates low.
You will get your wish. And you will regret it. There is no school in the SEC that is prepared for the Oregon offense. It's one thing to watch film and come up with a game plan. It's a completely different thing to be on the field.
