In WA, it says I either have to have a windshield, or wear goggles.  (understandable).  Legally, there's nothing stopping me from chopping off the entire top of my truck off, and driving it down the road with a pair of ski goggles on.  (no, I'm not doing that, I've already drove with a failed heating fan, and that was cold enough to freeze up the inside of the windshield so I had to put on my shades and hang out the window at 60 to see where the hell I was going).  Good point about the noise ordinances. :)  I completly forgot about that. :)  I rebuilt my father's 93 Geo Metro back in 2001, and decided "fuck the exhaust, and just ran a straight pipe.  He got a warning about 121 dB :D  I put on a muffler. :D I didn't bother with the cat since no emissions control around here.  (why I put on a glass pack on a Metro?  because I had an extra one, so why not?)  It met noise ordinances. :)
They've had that page up for 3 years now.  It's just flat out wrong.  When I called the cable company earlier this year, I had a question about why in the 90's that I was able to pick up cable TV with my antenna if I pointed it SSE, and had a complete channel line up, and would it work now?"  (yes, it really did happen, I was able to pick up a cable system over 30 miles away if the conditions were right).  They said likely a signal leak from a neighbor, but "it won't work now because every device connected to the network must be authorized."  I know that statement is false, because my analog TV just works like it always has, and my HDTV works perfectly fine to pick up both analog and ClearQAM service.  I never registered my serials with them, and just plugged them into the wall.  Cable here works just as it always has.  I still haven't gotten a satisfactory answer to how come I was able to pick up a city over 30 miles away cable TV system on my antenna back in the 90's.
I already created a shortcut to it on my desktop.  You can also get to it by Winkey + X, and selecting "Control Panel" on the popup menu.    However, the only way to get to Windows Update is through the new action center.  It's been removed from the legacy control panel.
Windows 10, the pre-review: Six things build 10240 reveals about the new OS
I wasn't trying to kill myself, and I don't think I'm fat and ugly because I'm fat, and if I only weigh less I'll be better looking.  I was just feeling like shit, so I didn't eat for a while, and then once a week passed and I was feeling OK again, I was waiting for the "I'm hungry" signal again to eat, but it never came.  Hence 19 days with no food, and ending up in the hospital for seizures.    All my step mom, (that is basically my mother since she and my father raised me since I was 2), was "Why do you always have to learn things the the hardest way possible, I have tried to tell you numerous times about the importance of eating, but no, you had to go get yourself hospitalized for starvation."  That didn't make me feel very good.  Another friend besides the one who threatened to tell her mom told me that she has a room that I can move into and if she needs to treat me like one of her kids, she will. :(  I never realized how many people cared what I do, even if I did it completely unintentionally, and didn't intend on killing myself through starvation.  It's not like I intended on passing out in the middle of WM and being hauled off to the hospital.  My truck was still in the WM parking lot when I was discharged, and I left the windows down and the keys in the ignition.  Yes, my truck was still there, (but the interior was wet because it rained).  Thank dog my seats are leather, I was just able to wipe it off and sit down to drive it away.    I don't think I have anorexia, but yes, I have 2 appointments with mental health professionals, an appointment with my physician, and now I have to take Keppra, and make an appointment with a neurologist because I had a seizure. :(  One good thing about Keppra, my hand tremors have stopped, and now I don't have dry heaves in the morning when I wake up, so it is doing some good. :)
DO NOT JUMP THE TRACK! Train accidents, crashes, collisions, near misses and rail idiots! Part 1.
Nah, I just thougt y'all would get a laugh.  While I hate to quote a blowhard, "Illustrate absurdity by being absurd".  There's a difference between not believing that U93 was taken down by civillians, (doesn't add up, and I'd shoot it down); v. Lizard men living at the center of the earth and Obama is a shape shifter and also the queen of england because you never see them at the same place at the same time)
What would walmart do if I kiped a buggy, and towed it home in my truck? (If I had a reason to kipe one)?
Either VGH or R-Tech systems.  Both places know what the hell they are doing.  They have parts.  I went to R-tech back in 2005 because I didn't have a spare MB and processor, so I took it to them.  6 hour turn around time.  I was impressed, so I let them fix it.  Oh, if you tell them not to touch a HDD, they'll physically disconnect it so you don't have to worry about being spotted for being a movie pirate with over 500G of film. :)
No kid should ever have to utter the words that "daddy is too busy, he flew off to Detroit, and I'm living at home alone now for the next 3 weeks" when asked by the teacher  at 8 "Why didn't your dad come to the parent-teacher meeting?  Is something going on?"  I got a lot of free food those 3 weeks, and had a lot of chores to do but "I kept the hosue running", so I did a good job.
[It's a chameleon.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmcA9LIIXWw) You get it by coming and going, and stringing people along like in your golden dreams. :D
Can you imagine that?  "The Last Perfect Day", and then it gets hotter, the sun gets brighter, and then it becomes insufferably hot, and then all of the organic matter around you starts wilting and dying off, then spontaneous combustion becomes a very real thing, then the world literally catches fire., then the atmosphere is blown off into space, and all of the water on the planet.  Plate techtonics break down because the surface is molten, and the planet it turned into a ball of molten rock, and then completly engulfed by the Sun, and vaporised.    The only trace of the Earth left would be a slightly higher iron and sulphur and sodium content in the sun.  Then the sun collapses, and earth is gone forever, (and venus and mercury).  Mars would likely survive as a burnt out husk like mercury is today, and the rest of the planets would be unaffected.  I think I would rather just shoot myself.
I was listening to the scanner, and I heard, "We found 191 shells, but no clue where they came from"  I heard radio chat about trying to find the guy, (me), but "we can't pin it down, there's no other reports of FA fire countywide".  Me and my dad kept quiet.   We saw the SWAT van come and leave, and stayed up just watching them roll on by.  All because somebody in a 98 Camaro called the cops om me. (according to the scanner).  Needless to say, I got the fuck out of dodge.
Alcoholics under going DT's experience tactile hallucinations, (and meth heads)  "ants crawling under my skin".  That would be a tactile hallucination.
ELI5: Why do some humans curl up in a ball when getting pummeled, (like a beaten dog), and others act like a cat and try to surrender by telling the agitator to "just do what you go to do" and remain limp, (like a cat exposing it's underbelly in a fight)? And what leads to these behaviors?   There is danger in either circumstance.  It's either "Hit me as much as you want, just please don't kill me" or "fine, kill me.  Just end it".
I don't think they do think it out, just pulling something out of my ass, but if I wanted to kill EMS workers, I'd report a false fire, (or start one in a skip), report it, and have trip wires on pipe bombs, and shoot mortars (the fireworks ones) at them.  That would actually cause a fire, and severely maim (or kill) whoever tripped the wire.  No, I have no intention of doing that.  I don't have a beef with anybody.  So burning your own house down and sitting there with an AK makes no sense at all.
Most shootings occur with gang-on-gang violence, and they're not supposed to have them in the first place.  It's already illegal to either supply felons with weapons, be a felon in a possession of a weapon, or do straw man purchases, or modify firearms to be automatic, or to alter the serial number, or import without a VERY thorough investigation, or a whole lot of other shit. (See 18 USC Section 922 for further details.  Yes, subsection (r), is pumb fucking stupid, but the law is the law.)
A) Money is money.  "equal distribution" makes no sense.  Why should a walmart greeter make as much as a doctor?  Are you that daft?  Fuck.  Cripples and idiots can be a walmart greeter.  B)  Yes, American politics are fucking dumb.  No argument there.  We have a 2 party system.  Like it or not, reality is what it is.  No amount of dreaming, or jerking off in your bed at night to fantasize about the Constitution or Green party will make any difference.
Can you imagine it launched today?  What would Sam Beckett do on 9/11, or 7/7?  How would he have handled the massive power out in NE during 2003?  How about the killing of Princess Diana in 97?  The fall of the Berlin Wall, and the collapse of the Soviet Union?  The OKC bombing?  The Y2K transition, when that was the last time humans weren't in space at all?  Don't forget about Iran Contra, and the Panamanian conflict.  Iraq because of oil, 10 years later, back to Iraq.  Color TV, and NTSC transition.  Antennas die, and resurrected again.  People getting off of cable, and putting up aerials and watching videos online.  14.4Kbps, 33.6Kbps, 56K, BROADBAND!  C-band satellite, Ku-satellite, Wild feeds, DBS, Cable, back to antenna again!  Planes wrecked, monuments destroyed, war again. "Depends on that the meaning of "is" is".  Entitlists, unemployment, economy died, economy "revived".  Housing collapse, market rebuilding, economy is still stagnant.  We didn't start the fire! It was always burning, Since the world's been turning. We didn't start the fire. No we didn't light it, But we tried to fight it!  OK, before I become Billy Joel and start writing Lyrics for "We Didn't Start the Fire, (2015)", I'll stop now. :D
"Worst performing"  Yeah, right.  DPRK and Cuba beg to differ.  Where do all the world leaders come to get advanced medical care?  Oh, that's right.  The USA.  They don't go to France or Indonesia.  Also, I did it exactly once because I needed food.  I hardly made a living at it.  And one hour for $50 of food is almost like I got paid to sit through the rambling nonsense of the preacher.  "food from god"  Yeah, right.  it's food from people who saw fit to donate to a cause that they supported, (feeding the needy).  "God" had nothing to do with it, any more than he does with the turds coming out of a cow's asshole while it eats on the range.  And if you were traveling the world, you weren't exactly "available for work each and every day", were you?  That is a requirement to collect unemployment.  You also have to make a minimum of 3 contacts per week, and actively look for work.  I'm fully aware of WA State requirements for collecting unemployment insurance.  Once again, I spent one hour there, and got "paid" for my time by food.  Pretty good deal.  Considering I can live easily on less than $100/mo by myself, and with my wife and daughter, I can keep it under $150/mo.  It's not exactly hard to eat on a tight budget, but eating out is a luxury that only happens about once a season.  (just like it used to be when I grew up).  Define "learn something useful".  If you mean Medieval History of Europe, or XXX studies, or philosophy, I consider those useless pursuits.  If it's not a tangible skill, I have no interest in learning it.  If it can't generate income, there is no purpose to learning it.  I do not care about "being well rounded".  I care about putting money in my pocket, and nothing else.  Also, the last I checked, school doesn't pay you to be there.  Internships are full of shit, and an excuse for free labor.
A person is born (in most circumstances), as either XX, (female); or XY, (male).  No matter how much you mutilate yourself to suit your "self-image", you are what you are.  Getting your dick split in half and shoved inside of you, or constructing a penis out of I don't know what makes you no more male/female than me if I walked outside right now dressed in drag saying "I'm a chick now" with a full moustache.  It's not a biological problem; it is a mental problem, and they need heavy drugs and counseling.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity_disorder
I was a teen when it first came out.  I stopped watching it after a dude was forced to give a BJ, and chomped the dudes dick off, then spit it in his face.  I decided I didn't want to see that, so I changed the channel, (Sat G5, T15, C-Band).    It's worth watching as an adult, but not for kids.  The pacific is gory, but it's good. :)  I have all 3 series on my computer.  Hell, I have enough video on my computer I could run a TV station.

EARTH DAY: 13 Failed Predictions of Environmental Catastrophe
Atheism as presented on the Internet is a secular religion. Let me present my case:   If you aren't liberal, you're "not a true atheist". The only thing missing is worship of a deity. Oh wait, most "practicing" atheists these days do worship something. Government has taken the place of a god. So it's a secular religion for most "practitioners" of atheism. If you don't comply to the "doctrine", you will be rooted out, and banned on FB. Small minds think alike, eh? Yeah, they're "tolerant", so long as you agree with them.
FWI: During Obama's last State of the Union address, he meets his Constitutional duty by doing it, but instead of appearing before the cameras, and all the pomp and circumstance, he sends it to the President of the Senate by US Certified and Insured mail, and calls it a day.   He refuses to make any more televised appearances, and does not give a farewell address on his last day.  He simply leaves when the new president arrives at the office.  No fanfare, nothing.  His term is done.  He gets on Executive 1, and departs without a word to the media.

FWI: The next president, with a super majority of congress decide to erect fortifications similar to the FDR/DDR border along the southern border of the USA.   Not to keep people in, but to keep people out.  There is a 1KM wide "No Man's Land", and there are landmines, attack dogs, automatically firing machine guns hooked up to motion sensors, armed drones, and border guards are told to "take no prisoners, but shoot on site any intruders".  We use the technology developed by the DDR and current DMZ in Korea to make an impenetrable border.
