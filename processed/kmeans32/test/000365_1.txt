Beautiful! Do you have any good projects in mind? Im trying to find a simple but elegant sock. Maybe a few cables or something. Time to search the depths of ravelry :)
I LOVE that idea but i only have 200 yds and want to work with what i have - thats a great suggestion for the future, and tarn is a great choice because of its durability...
Help!! I'm new to gussets and trying to decipher a pattern for the fingerless mittens I'm currently knitting   I need some fellow knitters' awesome advice and help please - I started knitting the Sweet Life mittens I found on Ravelry a little while ago. Having never done a gusset in my life before (I've only been knitting scarves and hats), I'm having trouble trying to decode this pattern. Here is the original pattern for the left hand gusset that the author wrote (keep in mind the patterned part is only on the top, there is ribbing underneath, and I'm knitting in the round):  Left Mitt Gusset Knit in pattern to last 2 K sts, move marker to this spot. Increase two sts between the final 2 sts by picking up the stitch below and knitting into the front and back of that stitch. Knit in pattern for two rounds. At the third round continue pattern, Slip marker. Kfb the next stitch, knit across gusset and kfb the last stitch in the round. You will continue in this manner, increasing 2 sts every third round, until you have 12sts in your gusset. Knit one round in pattern. At the end of the round remove the gusset sts to waste yarn. In the space left by the gusset sts, CO 6 sts. Knit 2 rounds in pattern. On the third round K2tog after Marker and again for the last two sts in round. Continue in this manner decreasing 2 stitches every third row until you are back to the original (36, 48) stitch count. Knit in pattern until 7.5 inches long.  So I have attempted to write this in an easier form for myself, row by row. Here is the majority of my attempt:  left gusset pattern written out: 1: repeat #2, last two knit stitches in pattern, move marker HERE. increase between next two stitches 2 stitches by m1 and kfb that stitch 2: repeat #3 3: repeat #4, after marker slip kfb next stitch, knit across gusset, kfb last stitch in round 4: repeat #5 5: repeat #6 6: repeat #7, after marker slip kfb next stitch, knit across gusset, kfb last stitch in round 7: repeat #8 8: repeat #9 9: repeat #10, after marker slip kfb next stitch, knit across gusset, kfb last stitch in round 10: repeat #11 11: repeat #12 12: repeat #1 after marker slip kfb next stitch, knit across gusset, kfb last stitch in round 13: repeat #2  14: repeat #3 15: repeat #4 after marker slip kfb next stitch, knit across gusset, kfb last stitch in round 16: repeat #5 17: repeat #6 18: repeat #7 after marker slip kfb next stitch, knit across gusset, kfb last stitch in round 19: repeat #8  20: repeat #9 21: repeat #10 after marker slip kfb next stitch, knit across gusset, kfb last stitch in round 22: repeat #11 24: repeat #12 25: repeat #1 after marker slip kfb next stitch, knit across gusset, kfb last stitch in round 26: repeat #2 27: repeat #3 28: repeat #4 after marker slip kfb next stitch, knit across gusset, kfb last stitch in round 29: repeat #5 30: repeat #6 31: repeat #7 after marker slip kfb next stitch, knit across gusset, kfb last stitch in round 32: repeat #8, slip gusset sts on waste yarn and cast on 6 sts in empty space 33: repeat #9 34: repeat #10 35: repeat #11, after marker slip, k2tog, k2tog last 2 stitches in round 36: repeat #12 37: repeat #1 38: repeat #2, after marker slip, k2tog, k2tog last 2 stitches in round 39: repeat #3 40: repeat #4 41: repeat #5, after marker slip, k2tog, k2tog last 2 stitches in round 42: repeat #6 43: repeat #7 44: repeat #8, after marker slip, k2tog, k2tog last 2 stitches in round 45: repeat #9 46: repeat #10 47: repeat #11, after marker slip, k2tog, k2tog last 2 stitches in round 48: repeat #12 49: repeat #1 50: repeat #2, after marker slip, k2tog, k2tog last 2 stitches in round  I have no idea if I'm doing this right. If any of you more experienced knitters could help me out on this, I would greatly appreciate your expertise! Also if you spot anything else in my "redone" pattern that looks a little wrong, feel free to let me know. It just seems like the whole gusset and actual body of the mitten would be so unproportional (lol is that a word even?)
