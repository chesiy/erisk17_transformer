I know there is a lot of tax-dodging, and many workers, especially migrant workers from the countryside, are employed in the black market. Where do the foreigners come into this ? Obviously there is something that I am in ignorance of. What countries do these people come from ? What sort of industries do they work in ? How do they pull it off. It seems the government would be hot on the trail of the lost tax money.

In Britain there have been programs that force people to work for various institutions, often NGOs *for no salary whatsoever*. There has been a lot of protest against this 'workfare'. If you were forced into that I don't think you'd be too happy. Similarly the way that 'job centres' work in most countries is that you God-damn better take what is offered/demanded. No begging off. Think about that for awhile.  As to the other unemployed workers who don't carry the label you may consider them 'privileged', and that, of course is your privilege to think as you wish. They, however, don't think it would be a 'privilege' to be so labeled. They, by the way, may be just as "hungry".  Sending the mentally ill to a 'job centre' is **not** so that they can be reassured that employers discriminate against them. It's so they can be forced to accept whatever a 'caring' bureaucracy feels or is told to feel is appropriate.
Yes, it can be interesting up to the point of fascinating. Trying to figure out who might have written such a thing and why can be a real head-scratcher. I don't think it's a google translate, at least from any language I am familiar with. I'd go with a stream of consciousness free association, penned for a reason I can't comprehend.
Thanks for the link.
Yep. You are the second person who noticed this. Of the 4 'rocky planets' only Earth is *known* to harbor life. Mercury and Venus definitely do not. Mars is still an open question, and only time will tell. I can remember two times of 'great excitement' about that. One was a report of 'organic structures' in a Martian meteorite found in Antarctica. The second was the first chemistry reports from one of the landers finding supposed metabolism from a Martian soil sample. Both failed to hold up on further scrutiny. The question is however still open as you note.
Double thanks here. One is that you jolted my conscience awake, and reminded me that I should really get around to finishing part 4 of the translation. Another thanks for jolting my memory about your Bakunin library project. Very interesting.  Interesting article by the way. The old 'name dilemma' happens to almost every anarchist who has been active for long periods of time. At some point the disgust with some of the anti-social trends the movement attracts begins to gnaw. Trying to correct public misconceptions about the meaning of the word becomes even more difficult when there are 'comrades' who are overjoyed at promoting the worst labels imaginable and all the labels imply.  'Libertarian socialism' is the most common euphemism, and one I have often used. 'Libertarian communism' in its Spanish or French renderings is probably the most common. Prefixes such as "social" are probably the most popular in English. Implying, of course, that there is such a thing as "anti-social" anarchism which is unfortunately true.
There is a more detailed [article](http://www.alasbarricadas.org/noticias/node/3435) in Spanish at the site of the Spanish anarchist magazine A Las Barricadas.
The journal 'Trends in Ecology and Evolution' is published by Cell Press, a branch of Elsevier. Yes, it is a reputable journal. I don't know if I understand your first point correctly, but it seems you are criticizing what is actually the common usage in these sort of papers. People routinely say that a certain trait is selected "for" or "against", and their statements contain the *implied* name of a trait that is the *opposite* of the trait they are speaking of. I know you are probably implying that a 'selectionist' argument for the origin of post-reproduction longevity doesn't necessarily follow from its contradiction of the expectation quoted above.  Now that's true, and the article in fact discusses this along with a number of other open questions surrounding the phenomena of this longevity. It's a *review* article not a report of results from original investigation, and as such it is open ended. It doesn't advance any firm answers. The point you raise is discussed in the context of comparisons of humans to other animals that show post-reproductive longevity *in captivity* but not *in the wild*. It's an interesting point to ponder.
Yep, it has been looked at. Over at the [California Department of Water Resources](http://www.water.ca.gov/desalination) (a busy place these days no doubt) they discuss a project initiated in 2002 that was to fund a mix of feasibility studies, pilot plants and actual operating facilities. They set up the 'California Desalination Task Force' which produced a seemingly detailed report, available on the site, in 2008. Yeah, I know, not lightening speed. I don't know the details about how all this turned out or what the situation is more recently, but I imagine there is more current material available from both this Department and other groups.
This post seems to have generated a bit of discussion, and I have expressed my opinion about its value below. All that I can add is that despite all the deficiencies pointed out, basically because of the purposes of the business unions and the fact it doesn't result in some huge and immediate eruption of working class self-organization, it is still something very valuable, praiseworthy and worth participating in. Massive changes in consciousness and organization don't happen suddenly. They are *always* prepared by a slow gradual back and forth of working for changes that may seem miniscule from a purist perspective. There is no other way. Yes, it is something to cheer. I'll give an analogy.  It's a football game, and you team has just made a 30 yard punt return. Do you grumble that it should have been 50, 60 yards or a TD ? Do you loudly complain about the intelligence of the quarterback or the running speed of the punt returner. Yes, the coach may be an asshole and incompetent to boot. The team manager may be dipping into the treasury, and the QB may be taking bribes to throw games. All of these problems *can't* be solved immediately with any amount of denunciation. Remember, it's still *your* team, and 30 yards is still worth cheering about.
Yes, that's my opinion as well. It leads to a great 'what to do'.
