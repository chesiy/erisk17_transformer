Do you laugh at him?
way too early
Good ridance! I abhor people like you doing what you want without thinking of the consequences. ,No, no no. this isn't a community, we're not a family and I wouldn't care otherwise. We're just greedy people, fuck the poor.

Here is the things OP should have known, no wall of text: - No porn, only right hand to wipe ass, and get da money.
RIP. You're next.
Yeah.  it looks  horrific.

What does the contract say?
I want that calander wedigt, please give.
For me I use my ears to learn and eyes. If I can see it and hear it, I repeated it two things and see it again and hear it. I remember it. Now my fetish is Japanese women, and I'm saving money or coaxing a good friend of mine to make a recording of all the vocabulary, short diagrams, or just formulas  And beat off to it while listening to it. Ever since I done this my GPA increased dramatically. also ask me about American History from 100BC to Rosevelt, I know pretty much everything.
Do you sell your kidneys?  I'm looking to buy one
You might start memories a menu and get into a habit of, :would you like a coke with that?:
You may see college as a financial hole and time but it's worth it. You learn so much. You become more prone to stupid shit non educated people would fall into. Unless you're already have an alternative to enrich your life, then by all means work from online. But it's best to have a back up plan? ex. I'm going for therapist (Love this job) but I'm always taking the TESLO/CBEST so I can teach if needed. But if your plans don't require pursuing education then it's not for everyone.
Depends what you like. If you suffer like me financially I'd go with the Note 4. Make scarifies in life for the things in it. E.x I don't eat at all outside, and mostly hang out with friends doing free shit, allowing me to Study Abroad in Japan for a few weeks. On the phones, usually the newer one is nicer, and better.
1) is definitely a nice one. But these are mostly written for stupid people, ergo, "self-help" As they cannot help themselves. But in an other life, You should take time to read A Prayer For Owen Meany, that book will Fuck You Up. Cheers! .
I'm buying one today, I'll add everyone? :)   edit: Oh, this is a female subbreddit, I just searched, "misfit shine" NEVERMIND
Yep. after I saw an AMA here I knew it was all over.  You only need 5 posts though.  Read the Top Posts of all time . "cheers"
I totally agree with you, OP. That's why I'm flying to Japan in 3 weeks. Fuck bills, fuck you. Let's fuck some kawaii japanese girls, desune.
this is why you should bleed red.
Such a good read. Haven't read this good  since it was only 1k.
spoliers!
Get zerolemon battery case. 80$ on amazon. 10,000mAH. I don't charge my phone every day, but every 2 days. Good if you're in college or use your phone for work. ( I use GPA a lot)
When I come home from work and see the kids waiting for me from the windows.
loved the kid's  apathetic reactions. "I like hockey, and I don't know why", "I'm so happy right now I don't know why". Poor kids, growing with the social outcasts with the beta dad.
Makes way more sense if you watch from the beginning. I feel like that part was left out on purpose to not make him look like a huge dick. Clearly he knew exactly where he was going.
Vist /r/SuicideWatch if anything goes atrwy. I can answer your question, OP. I live life for romance. Everything I do in life is for the sake of love. To me happiness is being healthy and seeing a beautiful asain girl, I approach her flirt with her, let her know I want to bang the shit out of her and hopefully  not get rejected. I will always do things for love. e.x Work - love - better production   School - love - great time, fun memories. Home - love - cook, Clean house  I'm just in love with life. Oh as an aspiring psychologost, I highly  recommend you find love- whether platonic or promiscuous, you need love as an individual  in order to feel like living. If you're really desperate try an escort services and after the first experience  you'll fathom. Best of luck! (also worst come to shove, please be an organ donor)
19 [M4R] CA- Need something fresh   I'm a heterosexual male attending a Cal State. I just realized yesterday that my friends were losers. And am looking for other friendships as of now.   My interests: Learning Japanese (Going to Japan this summer) I know  a little french and fluent in Spanish and English. I love to read, travel and buy stuff online. I'm an audiophile; plan to practice therapy in 2017.     **tl;dr** **Looking for people who are great socializers.**
I went through something similar to what you went through OP, not as drastic but just as traumatic. When I was 17 I got hit by a car. I broke my neck-C-7- If it was one bone down-C-6- I would have been a quadriplegic. My mom wanted to go to court to sue the driver. But I couldn't. I told her if she did I wanted nothing to do with it. It was a moment of time where I didn't want to relive. I had my neck broken for fucks sake. I had to wear a neck brace for 3 months. Can you imagine being in high school for that duration? My friends were awesome about it, making fun of me- I liked it, it made it less threatening- but I still got looks and empathy from people. I just wanted it all to go away. I still keep the torn helmet from the crash to remind myself that life goes on. I'm not sure how old you are, but no one can force you to do anything, in the US-long as you're not incriminated. You can tell your therapist to eat shit, you're not talking. Sure, maybe the cops will be involved but so what? Plea the 5th. You don't have to say shit, if you don't want to. But don't repress that memory or else it will manifest from within. I was at peace with the accident, and so should you. Let it go, there is nothing you can do about it now. Just accept it happened and move on with your life. You're not going in that direction why look there? Keep moving forward. Good luck.
