Also this:  NewsBreaker @NewsBreaker 2m2 minutes ago  Unconfirmed reports say the shooting occurred at a U.S. Naval Reserve on Amnicola Highway in Chattanooga, Tenn. - @wdefnews12  So, still breaking, no firm details I have found yet.
GA Gov Press release: Deal to pursue redesign of Sons of Confederate Veterans tag
The dog was a mutt, ran up towards the officer when the door opened. Shot missed (obviously) and the family quickly got the dog under control (this according to local news anchor at 10tv).
Should have pepper sprayed the food, might give it some flavor.  Last time I was in CA and had del taco I couldn't finish eating it, made Taco Bell seem like gourmet food.
Here is their basic ideal (and why it is a sham):  We can all own our own businesses and with hard work can be rich.  If everyone owned a business, who would work for them?? We need workers.  The people in this country who get the most work the least. If we all worked 60 hours a week we all still wouldn't be making the same amount of money. So it isn't about "Hard Work". It never has been.  Those who do the actual work, the workers, at times ask for the same things investors do - a return on their 'investment'. But the right calls workers greedy when they do and whine about how prices could go up.  Investors want the same thing and prices go up? The right cheers that on as capitalism.
High court throws out conviction for Facebook threats
Honestly, I don't care either way. I just come here to post and comment on some news/politics/and a few other things. The bot picked me up. I get all replies to my mail, and it sent like 5/7 messages. Never heard of it, you, etc, and honestly don't give a shit either way.  But looking at reddit rules and such I would speculate that the 'joke' isn't seen as a joke and more as an attempt at harassment of others. Which no one really wants. If you are looking for a reason why one bot is allowed and one is not that seems like the most likely reason.  Just putting my 2 cents in. I do find it funny though that is labeled me/inferred I am some sort of SJW. Now that is a hoot. Damn, people on liberal boards tell me I am libertarian/a little right, conservatives think I am a flaming liberal (not fond of modern day cons myself, more old school and perhaps closer to some UK style cons on some issues).  I really don't care enough about people on reddit and their opinions to bother with bots. But to each their own. Just wish they would leave me out of it.
Depends. I spoke up several times on issues, which gets IA(internal affairs) involved. It made my life hell there.   Imagine a police force like being a very very partisan website when it comes to politics. Sometimes, people don't listen to reason and see anyone who doesn't agree as a threat - ala the old "you are with us or against us".  There has to be a will, not just by a few officers, but by the public and those in power, to take it serious. I was harassed by senior deputies (sgt/lt). It didn't help that I personally knew the sheriff and he had hired me in. Keep in mind, the sheriff is elected and comes and goes, and he/she has to play politics with those who have been there awhile.   Police forces are, for a big part, political entities. They won't reform themselves from within.
*He was a victim of a system that is just waiting for an excuse to attack, and he gave the system that reason. If you poke a bear you should not be surprised if you are bitten*  And if you're caught speeding don't be surprised if a government employee beats you. I mean, after all, you gave them a reason to interact with you. Heck, the person pulled over has probably sped many times so they obviously have total disregard for the law.  By the way, what crime was he guilty of that they chased him down?
Nice use of 'strawman' - people seem to pull out that word a lot....  Conservatives here in the US are, by and large, loony religious zealots. Against gays in military, gay marriage, etc because they fear god will send hurricanes/judge America.   They insist Obama is a muslim - again, bringing religion into politics. They create policies based on bible verses they take out of context "If a man does not work he does not eat" kind of crap.  Their whole philosophy they back up with god. And yes, they are wanting to punish America. Look at what was being said when Obama was elected; they wouldn't cooperate with him, rush/et al said they hope he (thus we) fail.   Try listening to rw radio for a week or reading what the loonies are claiming (obama and ebola and how we were all gonna die cause he hates america, the whole stolen libyan jet BS which turned out to be false, Obama will take all the guns with no discussion of how he was going to, etc and so on).
I ain't no big fan of Obama either and not a huge fan of the aca (better than nothing to get the ball rolling). Some of his policies and decisions I can certainly complain about. But, yeah, these people are just plain nuts. If he looks the wrong way while at the podium they run off screaming he is a commie mooslim who took all the border patrol away and threw open the border for ebola laden kids trained by isis.  I don't take the right serious anymore and will never, ever, in my whole life vote for a republican (which I did up until 2004, including raising some funds for ole bush).   It's like some virus from space landed on earth and took over their minds and erased critical thinking skills, courage, honesty, etc. It makes me regret saying I ever voted for them in the past. Was i that dumb or was the party a little different last century?
Some laws remove restrictions, some fix problems (VA/etc). Not all laws are made to restrict freedoms but help the government we pay for to run better and change as needed.
Yeah...no. You're failing in that. But it's ok.   "When I see" is a rather broad definition. I saw it in a news story, posted it. And all you are able to contribute to this thread is whining about me?  Heh. I'll give you a 8/10 on the trolling front - because I am enjoying it.  Keep trying, I think we can bump you up to a 9/10 if you play it right.
Teacher who died in a crash. He crashed into a phone poll which allowed his spirit to tap into the internet/wi-fi - and he used the GPS to kill the guy in the car (but let his wife out first).
And he still was convicted of nothing until now. So yeah, I tend to stick to my principles even when they end up maybe not having the best result. Something it seems other are willing to ditch because they never honestly held them in the first place.
I think I confuse her in my old age with Loretta Lynn a lot.  Overall: Obama nominated her, she won't serve very long, and I don't see that her impact will be all that much given the scope of the job and the short term she will be serving. If congress approves her and Obama is for her than what I think of her isn't relevant at all to anyone.   I am pro MJ but short of some national legislation making it legal I don't see her views on it impacting much. It's not like cheech or chong were nominated. If her job is to uphold the law as it is written her views on it all won't matter a lot anyway - though she could divert resources.   What does one expect a person to say when applying for a job "I think your rules suck and I won't endorse them or enforce them"?
