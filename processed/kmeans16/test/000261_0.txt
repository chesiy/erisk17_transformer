This is awesome!  Thank you!
VERY true!  In this case you're right, I'm likely ok because it's obviously a brassica.  I normally wouldn't bother trying to eat something like this but there is such a large amount of it that it seems wasteful to not try!
Thanks RonRonner!  We kept her happy and comfortable as long as we could.  She'd had IR problems since she was about 10, and I had to stop riding her about a year before we put her down at the age of only 16.  She had some problems keeping weight on, but never got too bad.  The farm and their staff is incredible, and I credit their expertise and diligent care when it comes to how long she stayed sound and happy.  She is buried on the farm, under the pasture where the new foals play. :)
Morgans are great little dressage horses!  I have several friends who use their horses for dressage, and now Western dressage is becoming really popular as well.  If you want any Morgan dressage connections, PM me and I can get you in touch with the right folks.  Even though my horse competes in hunter pleasure, we do a lot of basic dressage exercises with him at home, especially now that we're trying to get him better with patterns.  He overthinks everything and jumps to conclusions!  The dressage work is slowing his brain down a bit. :)  Here's a pic of him doing his thing in the show ring because, well, who doesn't love more horse pictures? :)  http://i.imgur.com/TVTI0.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/fs8Fh.jpg
Thanks for dropping me a PM!  I'll let you know when I hit town.  I've honestly been overwhelmed by the number of responses I've gotten.  It would be great to meet up and swap Minneapolis stories!  - Nicole
Holy crap Dan, that was a fast reply!  I may indeed be up for dinner with your and your ladyfriend.  I'll be living in what I think is Near East (right by Olbrich).  I'm a very social person and like having a large group of friends that enjoy doing things on a fairly regular basis.  Generally, I'm up for most things.  Going out, staying in, having potlucks/grilling out, going to museums/concerts/.    I bit about me, I suppose.  I'm a 27 year old female currently living in Minneapolis and finishing my Master's thesis in Landscape Architecture.  The job at Olbrich is just a stop-gap internship while I find work in a design firm.  That job may be in Madison (if I fall in love with the place and there is work), or I may be moving in the fall to one of the coasts in hopes of getting a job out there.  I will also be continuing my job for the University of Minnesota as the copyeditor of the Landscape Journal, which will keep me a bit busy, at least for the summer.  I really appreciate you writing back so quickly!  The next few weeks are going to be tough as I uproot myself from the safety of graduate school and the friends I have made over the last 9 years of living in Minneapolis.  However, as we all know, change is necessary, and I sincerely hope the best is yet to come in my life!  I'll be in touch,     Nicole
My friend's daughter, after finding out she had a GREAT cross country time!  This pair is too cute.
(x-post from r/aww) My horse likes when you read to him. Here is my mom reading him a bedtime story titled "My Pony" at his last horse show.
AH YES!  I have the biggest ladyboner for him.  And this picture is my favorite.  It's gotten to the point that just seeing radishes like these gives me a ladyboner!  And when he wears a plaid shirt and rolls up the sleeves, and you get to see those forearms...*swoon*  I've met him a couple times, and not only is he a total hottie, he is also a humble sweetheart.  A very nice guy!
Starbuck!  She is super cute!  Mine is Apollo, also after BSG!  (http://i.imgur.com/8OuAw.jpg)
I do wish that I had seen this about 3 month ago.  I really wanted to live in that direction.  Alas, too late!
Hey FlameGirl!  I'll go through these one by one:  1) You can do some things to encourage head and neck position, but most of all the horse has to be built for it.  My horse is not, that is is why he because a hunter and not a saddleseat-type horse.  However, assuming the horse is upheaded to begin with, the upheadedness and head carriage come from a) building muscle and b) collection.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Dumb jockeys are used, taking the place of a rider when a horse isn't being ridden.  They help teach a horse the proper "frame" to be in.  When we ride, our hands are elevated to meet the elevation of our horse's head and neck.  While riding, you can bump and tickle your snaffle bit to ask the horse to keep his head up.  Of course, none of this is possible without good impulsion from the hind end.  When a horse pushes off its hind end, it elevates its front end.  There are plenty of horse that go around the ring with their head down because they are not collected and pushing off the hind!    2) I don't know much about rollkur.  I've never seen it used outside of dressage. :/  3) The rider sitting farther back on the horse does not have any ill effects on the horse's back.  Morgans, Saddlebreds, etc. have a center of gravity that is in the middle of their back (they are built in an upright fashion) as opposed to a thoroughbred or quarter horse whose center of gravity is over the shoulders.  The saddles are designed to sit in the middle of the horse's back and the flaps are cut back to free up the horse's shoulders and not impede their movement.  4) Whips are used pretty much like they are in any other discipline I suppose.  Lots of riders show without whips.  I rarely use them, even at home when training.  Sometimes they are carried as a "prop", especially in equitation classes, and I carry one in the ring sometimes because my horse tends to focus and listen better if I'm holding it.  Otherwise, it's just an aid, as it is with anything else.  5)  Many Saddlebreds and Hackneys have had their tail "set".  In other words, a muscle in the underside of the tail has been cut to allow the tail to stretch up and bend over at the top.  Some people think that the tail bone is broken, which is not the case (and would be awful!).  My horse is a Morgan, so this type of procedure is illegal for our breed.  He does, however, wear a bustle in his stall to encourage an "arched" tail carriage.  Desired Morgan tail carriage looks like this: http://www.playmorfarm.com/Play_mor_farms_stallions/stallion_images/centerpiece-thumb-2010-2.jpg  Desired Saddlebred tail carriage looks like this: http://www.goinggaited.com/Born_Contender_al_12-4-06.jpg  Feel free to ask follow up questions!
Thanks for pointing out that this is serious, dizzysparrow.  While it is entertaining, there is quite a bit of pain associated with it.  I partially dislocate things all the time -- they often pop back in on their own shortly after, but that doesn't mean it doesn't hurt.   I've also sprained my left ankle 18 times, usually just by walking down the sidewalk, and my right 13 times.  This to me is "normal".    As for how it effects my daily life, it depends.  I cannot hold a pen for very long, so I take all notes on my laptop when I'm in classes.  Winter is the hardest -- my hands and legs stiffen up and I have problems holding onto things and moving my fingers.  I was in a drawing class this winter where I had to hold a pen for hours.  I would have to come home at night and use hot packs on my hands to ease the pain.  Of course there is the obvious -- I can't run, so fun co-ed sports are out (mostly) and I have to invest in a gym membership to stay fit since I can't just go running (though I do bike in the summer).  I believe that the worst thing about HMS is that people can't tell you have it, and therefore can't understand why you hurt or think you are "whiny".  If you looked at me walking down the street, I look no different than most people aside from a slight limp I sometimes have.  You cannot always see pain.
Well, he has a son...so too late!  Also, from what I have seen/heard, he is a FANTASTIC father.
That is excellent!  Thanks for the info.  Also, I upvote this not just for the help, but also for the hilarious name of the website.
Songwriters of Reddit: a challenge.  Write my dog a theme song! (xpost from r/dogs)   The dog in question is Apollo, a springer spaniel/golden retriever mix. I often sing to him about his greatness, his beauty, and his strength, but I'm no songwriter, and I think he deserves an anthem of sorts. I know that a song about Apollo would make my boyfriend incredibly happy, so this is a surprise of sorts for him!  First off, here are some photos of Apollo for inspiration: http://pineappleblurt.imgur.com/apollo#38wmp  Now, some Apollo facts:  - I often sing of how he crunches the bones of his enemies, and that he is the destroyer of Tirmok, and had pillaged and burned many villages and thatched roofed cottages.  - Apollo loves the water. He also loves tennis balls, bones, eating, and his eternal love -- our neighbor Deb.  - According to Apollo, no one ever feeds him. Dinner time for him is all the time.  - He was named not for the god Apollo, but for Apollo from Battlestar Galactica.  - He has a superhero alter ego named DarkFart, who fights crime under the cover of darkness.  This doesn't have to be an original melody. Something epic sounding, like the Soviet national anthem, would be incredible. Silly lyrics, about Apollo's unrivaled awesomeness, strength, and beauty, are a must. :D  Forward songwriters! I hope someone accepts my challenge! If I end up with an mp3 of a song all about Apollo, I'll be the happiest girl alive.
