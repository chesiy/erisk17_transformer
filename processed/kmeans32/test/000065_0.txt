A quick reminder of the shame and embarassment of PMO   So I walked in on my brother, let's say, jerkin the gerkin'. I immeadiately closed the door but he was obviously embarassed which reminded me one (of the many reasons) that I'm abstaining from fapping.   The embarassment on his face showed me how shamed he was. People talk about it like it's normal and healthy and that "everyone does it" but if these were true then why do people get so embarassed when the subject matter comes up?
Wow. That's weird, I practice lucid dreaming and I hear a lot of people get sleep paralysis (like you said evil figures and feeling an evil presence). I'm fortunate that I haven't went through it... yet but if I do I hope I don't shit myself (kiding... kinda). I only practice dream induced lucid dreaming so the risk is low.
Yeah, I agree.
It's a website (obviously). You subscribe to subreddits which interest you (like r/gaming or r/baseball etc) there is a subreddit for virtually everything!   Here you can talk to people with similar interests as you, trade things, ask questions (as you have done so eloquently yourself) and more!

Oh my god that is so fucking awesome, thank you!! :D
Okaaaay.
Yeah let's just assume you will at least reach 85 and you will still be ignorant to the date  and year
That's sad. I've read of people losing their entire life savings. Can I ask, if you don't mind, what he felt, thought or said when the new rentenmark came to be and he knew his money would never be worth anything again?
Ha, ha apparently so. I'm from Scotland it's not nearly as common here.
Wow! That was beautiful. I never expected anything like that. I really have to applaud you. The ending was sad but with a re-read there were hints and the fact that it seemed so *real* is a great bonus. If I never  knew that you had just written that you could put it in a history book and throw a name or two on it and I'd certainly believe it was from the time.
You have to want to. What do you want to be. I used to just lay around playing xbox, I always wanted to be a doctor but I stopped and asked myself what do I really want out of life? I decided that I wanted to be a history teacher since I love the subject and for other reasons. Any way now I study way more, I used to study for a while each night now I'm going to study for six hours a day for the next 3 weeks. Set a goal and work towards it.
I think a fuppa is a weird way of saying pubes? If it is I shave, best thing to do is shave with the hair, down, untill your skin gets used to it, then after a few weeks if you keep it up you can shave against it for a closer shave. You should buy nivea men 48 hour anti-perspirant. I no longer need it but when I started shaving it made it stay smooth and I never once itched, eventually you get used to it and it won't itch.
Ok no problem, I'll message you now :)
I agree (not as an American, I'm scottish). The people were going through a tough time, to say the least. They were desperate  Hitler, a great speaker who had won medals in the war for bravery offered them away out. He would defy the treaty of Versailles and lead them back to power and happiness. That's how they saw it was just that he was a cunning deceitful man who managed to gain power. Like you said it could happen in any country.
Ha, ha!! :)
Look I put it in there for those that are religious, don't like it then leave. You can't complain about someone else's beliefs. Ok not everyone is religious but like I said it's there for those that are!! This really isn't a big deal. You're making mountains out of mole holes. No one else here has complained, look at the other comments that have stemmed from yours. Two other people agree with me. It's not a big deal.
Thank you :)
Ha, ha :)
I just relapsed today, don't worry about it. I'm just going to pick myself up an  learn from it. Here, good [luck](http://imgur.com/cU848GQ)
Hey no problem :)
Don't worry I'm 15 I don't plan on sex for another few years
I'm not fat but I drink more milk than anyone I know and I love chocolate!! :D
Ha, ha I think that's the strangest I've heard yet but if you enjoy it who am I to judge :)
That's not so great, maybe you should talk to her about it or get some kind of help. If you don't she might leave you and you'll regret it. Hope everything turns out ok.
I'm at ten days too! :D great job and good luck. I'm having all these benefits too. I'm more of an indoor/gamer type person but I'm going out more, seeing friends that I normally only see at school and the dreams have been great, a lot more vivid but of course Istill play a ton of xbox :)
Good luck to you! :D

I don't know I'm not god. I can't answer this but I still have faith. I'm going to stop here cause I don't want these comments to turn into a religious battle (ha, ha battle with swords and stuff) but if you want to talk feel free to pm me. It's up to you :)
Aaw that's nice. I like that more than anything I've seen so far. Just the reassurance :)
Tonorrow marks one week since I last fapped, here's a quick report...   So I'm fifteen years old, I tried nofap a while back for a few reasons. Religion (I'm catholic), for myself, I wanted a better out look on things and to change my view. PMO made me feel like women all fake orgasms and that they're whores (if they're in porn) I shouldn't have judged them.   I made it to four days last time and decided I would fap, I've never been addicted to it, because I said if I balance it, it's healthy and I don't need porn I can use my mind. All was going well but then I thought ok one porno isn't so bad so I watched some cartoon porn, I was watching it around 3 times a week then I went back to real porn. That's when I said no! No more. I'm gonna do nofap and I'm going to do it right this time. Tomorrow I go from a smiley face to a number 1. It isn't much but it's a big step for me. I've thought, over the last week, you're still early in just do it once, no big deal but straight away I said no. It'll be nice then but what about after? So I always said no and focused on something else.   I read a post that said always say yes or no for things you're unsure about. Not maybe, not if this happens then, just yes or no. And so far no has been great here and yes has been great in other parts of my life. I know it's early and I have no huge results yet but I can do this and so can you. Good luck.
