Let's give the man a chance before we decide he isn't a good fit for this team. I, myself am very excited to see him play on the 4th line. I watched him quite a bit when he was in town with the Wolves. He is speedy, has good hands, and is Shawzian in his ability to get under people's skin.   Many of you were flipping out at the thought of Desjardins replacing Ben Smith, and we all seem to be fine with that now. Garbutt possesses more offensive upside than Desi or Smith.   I predict we'll get about 12-14 goals out of him this season, and while he'll make trips to the penalty box, he and Shaw will be earning us a number of power plays.
Classic. According to television, a fictional version of Louis CK drives one of those. You're in elite company, good sir.
THE CHICAGO BEARS ARE WHO WE THOUGHT THEY WERE!
Yeah, man. Who could forget that night that when Jordan had the flu, and he went out and got five points against the Avs, including the game winning assist on a Tony Amonte goal.

Well, let's not pretend that Foley and Eddie O are the greatest.   Olczyk: "Here's a tip for all you young hockey players, see how Johnny Toews has his stick on the ice, you have a much higher percentage chance of scoring with your stick ON the ice."   Foley: "And with that goal the Hawks should take some momentum into the TURD period."  Then... 30 seconds of silence
A couple of educators looking to increase career potential. Does going back to school make sense?   Hello, career gurus.  I'll try to make this as to-the-point as possible, but I apologize in advance if this turns into the Unabomber Manifesto.  My wife (age 27) and I (age 26) both work for the same company, but at different sites. We are reading specialists who work in the clinical setting; that's about as descriptive as I'm getting about the private company we work for. We both have had previous management roles in the company, but upon relocating to Chicago (my hometown/where my wife has decided that she wants to stay forever) we have limited opportunities for growth within our company, and have since taken pay cuts.  I have a teaching degree, but my only endorsement is in Social Studies; it has been way less fruitful trying to land a classroom position here in Chicago than my search in DC. (I got one on my first interview there). My wife does not have a teaching certificate, but is going to get her Masters' in Special Ed and her IL License. She'll get a job in 2 years, not doubting that. I'm considering doing a 9 month program to get my endorsement to teach Special Ed as well. (We both have a number of years working with this population in the clinical setting).  Here's how the proposed Grad School costs break down: Wife's Masters' Degree: $35k My Endorsement: Probably $12k  I feel like my wife is a bit of a spontaneous person and not a planner like myself. I can't really see these costs making life too much easier at the moment. Especially if we are multiplying our debts 4 or 5 times. I hate to say this to her, but I'm starting to think that when we move out of our nice $1300/mo apartment on the Northside this December that we won't be able to live in a place this nice for the next decade. (We won't be getting rich as teachers, but the expected salary would probably be about $48k with increases; that's about 15-20% more than what we make now)  With this outlook, should I focus on how going back to school may maximize our earning potential, and provide more for our future (a pension plus a 403b plan, rather than the 401k that our employer matches 10%) or is will this make us highly-qualified, yet broke educators?  Any thoughts appreciated.  Thanks!
Unless you consider his habit of fighting guys smaller than him, and losing most fights an "enforcer." Seriously, watched this guy with the Chicago Wolves (AHL) years ago; he lost every fight.   However, [loved the fight with Shaw this winter](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-SRugYRRV0); and I gained an inkling of respect for him for [his fight with Bollig](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4k_JEa8IGQ)

3 assists in the first 12 minutes. I would say he showed up; going to need Kane to keep razzling and dazzling for the next 170 minutes of the series.

Make a short trip west on North Ave. Al-Mart has some quality mattresses and beds. Just got my second one from them. The first one I had was so solidly built that I needed a hacksaw to get it out of the bedroom.  Also, ask about free delivery; if you're in Humbolt Park you'll probably get it.
Gary is such a sad story. There were 180,000 people in Gary 50 years ago. Now there might be 75,000. About 50% of their kids are graduating from high school. Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm going to assume that crime is out of control. I just moved back to Chicago after living in DC for a year. I stopped in Gary with my big clunky u haul, and was immediately approached by the gas station security guard. He seemed curious to know why I chose to stop there, then warned me it was a bad area. It just struck me as desolate.
It is a legit lead now.
Ah. That makes more sense.
**[ENTRY]** [Pontiac Fiero GT] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:FIEROi2.jpg) Why? An American mid-engine two-seater from a defunct manufacturer that is made almost entirely of plastic and has a weird cargo section near the engine, no bonnet (hood), and still has a cult following.   Get Clarkson in one of these, would love to see his reactions to it.
