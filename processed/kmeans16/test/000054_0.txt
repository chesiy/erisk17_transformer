Y'know how after the fight the guy says "Well that was fun" in a really twee way? Well, If you're versed in british passive aggression like me you'll know that that remark is basically telling they're leader that he was right that it was a stupid idea to go against tombstone with that bot.
And Bloodborne can be beaten in 36 minutes without glitches.
But none of the technicalities you listed stophim from being like batman. He still had a sidekick, is still a detective, (literally the first issue of his new series is about detective work) still uses gadgets, still uses batarangs, still had a batmobile and batcopter, still fights crime in a costume that looks like batmans, still glides around like batman, (and one of the most iconic elements of batmans character is that he glides around) has an insignia costume etc. The stuff about Khonshu is debatable, too, as it's constantly questioned whether Khonshu exists. For a reader that hasn't heard of him, the closest approximation to Moon Knight that they'll have heard of is undoubtedly Batman. Same goes for a lot of other peak humans in the Marvel universe, Like Daredevil and Black Panther, even though they have far fewer similarities to batman than Moon Knight.
Just weigh the negatives up against the positives, and your personal sentiment towards the film. You don't need to have a 'list' to go through, as it's not like you're gonna crack some mathematical formula that makes everyone agree with you. The reason a five star system is used a lot is because it's deliberately vague, and means that the majority of the time you don't have to judge one movie you really liked as objectively better than another movie you really liked.   My advice is to read a lot of criticism to see how they do it. Look at den of geek, or Roger Ebert.com or Total Film, or listen to Mark Kermode and see how they appraise things.
I don't really think Annalise was attempting to birth a great one, considering she seems to be a relatively neutral party, and got attacked by the executioners. If we're throwing really off the wall theories up, may I suggest that The wet nurse is actually Velka from Dark souls? She's implied to be more omnipotent than the other Gods in that game, has a strong association with crows, and Marvelous Chester is implied to come from a victorian setting, which implies that Yarnham may be Carim from DS, a land that Velka is strongly implied to be associated with.
You sort of need to get a bit further into Peace walker for it to really 'click'. Once you start fultoning a lot of guys the game really starts to open up, and all the controls are designed to make you feel like this incredible badass. I'd also recommend playing through MGS3 again, either  with a guide or having read the TV tropes page. There's an incredible amount of neat stuff you've missed. Just the end alone has about 50 unique interactions, and you can do cool stuff like throwing rotten food around the fear, which'll make him eat and poison him.
When did I ever say those were the plotholes my hypothetical redditor was referring to? I mean, you do understand I was referring to the absurdity of the complaints, because the way you said "I don't think they did?" in regards to Gallifrey really makes me think that you thought I actually didn't know it wasn't meant to be there (Although I saw a lot of confused people on the discussion thread, which I thought was absurd)
Fantastic, I really appreciate the effort. Just a quick question, but is anything major from a lore perspective equivalent to say, Kaathe from DS locked behind world tendency?
Xenoblade chronicles did that.In fact, It's about climbing from one giant dead machine god to the other, evil giant dead machine god.
Don't worry bout it man!
I get where your coming from, I truly do, and I HOPE Ant man is a good or great film, and that Edgar Wrights vision carries over,however, I think the complaints are way more justified than you make them out to be.   1) Joss whedon is in no way comparable to Reed. Joss Whedon worked on the scripts for X-men, Toy story and the x-men comics. He also wrote and directed multiple Emmy award winning shows that had directorially strong moments. ('Hush' comes to mind) He also made Serenity, which, commercial success or not, was one of the best Sci-Fi movies of the past decade. It's dumb to have doubts about Joss Whedon, it's not to have doubts about Peyton Reed, whose made multiple Bad, mediocre, and more importantly generically directed movies.   2) Favreau also made multiple great movies, I don't get why people keep bringing Elf up, It was a great Christmas movie. Alan Taylor directed episodes of the most critically acclaimed fantasy TV show of all time.The Russo's are slightly more comparable but didn't take over from an amazing Action director like, say, Tarantino.   3) I think the most valid comparison is actually another studio. Darren Aranofsky was originally set to direct the wolverine. But got replaced at the last minute due to 'directorial differences.' You can logically apply all the same arguments to FOX, they hadn't gotten it wrong yet, (x-men 3 and origins wolverine are comparable to the incredible hulk and Iron man 2) James Marigold has directed stuff before etc. etc. posthumously, don't you think people saying Aranofsky would've done a better job were correct? This stuff has precedence, it's not completely out of leftfield.   Small aside: Edgar's work is hardly obscure stuff, ESPECIALLY as we have to compare it to British films rather than American films. The cornetto trilogy has been hugely critically successful, and was one of the most commercially successful franchises in British cinema. Even Scott pilgrim didn't lose money and became a cult hit on DVD.   In conclusion. The Edgar Wright fiasco is way more rational that going "wah wah, Gal Godot is too skinny"
Don't sweat it, I already did a much larger comment reply or r/anime:   I started watching it pretty much immediately after Kill la kill, and it doesn't hold up well in a character department. The characters in Kill la kill (and Madoka magica, which I watched after getting bored of AOT) are magnetic, genuinely entertaining characters, whereas I only really cared about Misaka in AOT, because she's way more interesting than the protagonist. I also found the battle of Trost to be ridiculously overdrawn, full of filler, and poorly paced within it's own arc and the general series (Erin fights, and nearly defeats, the colossal Titan in the first episode of the arc with barely any fanfare, the political intrigue, and royal guard/expedition force stuff should have been well before the battle of Trost) I also feel that AOT is really unable to provoke 'the feels' in me, because I've seen the 'Mother dies in front of protagonist's eyes' trope so many times in comicbooks, as well as Mikasa's backstory and charactrer being similar to Claymore backstories. (the only other anime I ever watched) I also really didn't feel threatened by the Titans, as the 3D manouvre gear made every character spider man (Very little is shown to make it seem like the gear is ineffective other than dialogue, such as an apparent 1/5th of forces dying during a simple distraction detail)   I don't however, think it's terrible, and it is a good show. I'm just baffled why it's the show everyone tries to convince non-anime people like me to see, when Madoka magica is IMO a masterpiece.
I was mainly talking about how the Makogoori ship essentially implies that the entire series was about Gamagoori working up the courage to ask Mako out. I think the main reason people think Makogoori 'won' is that after the episode premiered, that ship was **dead** without that ONE PANEL in the credits (which I would also points out, means that we never get to find out what the E4 did after the events of the show) Ryumako would pretty much undoubtedly be canon (other arguments would be called heteronormativity to a much greater extent than the current norm) so when people found that image, many on the second viewing, Makogoori 'rose from the ashes.' People started making comics, and the rest is history.
OK, that makes much more sense, as that's a translation error, however, I would still say that still doesn't CONFIRM or disprove any ships, as we have no idea when the ending ED is set. (presumably, in my opinion, the 'date' isn't shown in the epilogue, as it's obviously set way after the ending, whereas the dialogue implied that the 'date' would be a more immediate, spontaneous thing)  The ending will still ultimately, be ambiguous, and I actually think that's a bit gutless, but oh well.

I think you should E-mail the yogscast about this. A reddit post called 'a suggestion' isn't the best way to attract attention, but I wish you luck all the same!
