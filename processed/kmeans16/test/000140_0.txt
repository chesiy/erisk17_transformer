How hard are landmines to see by infrared reflection? A cheap drone could do that kind of work, and at nighttime when the weather isn't so punishing.
I don't live in SF directly so I can't give a 100% accurate comment, but in my experience getting around the city was a pain by car and by public transit. Parking is literally impossible and the transit system is a joke for a supposedly rich city. At least south of the bay you have some more breathing room. In my opinion there are just as many things to do for young professionals, with the sole exception of nightclubs.
Upvoting you because I'm sure you'll get a downvote brigade pretty soon because of your comments on marijuana. I think it's insane that people think drugs that mess with your perception of reality have little side effects. Personally I don't smoke it anymore, drink socially, and even my caffeine intake is a lot less than it used to. A lot of people have problems with self-control and "dosage" control, so what ends up happening is that these chemicals will really ruin your emotional and mental well-being.
Have a PhD in a hard science at an Ivy League and went to a pretty competitive undergraduate program at a public school, so I feel somewhat qualified to comment. My grades weren't straight A+s, but they were pretty decent.  - Do your best to go to class and pay attention. Even if the professor is the worst in the world, at the very least you are copying down notes and have some passive absorption. And would you seriously be studying if you had skipped class?  - Do your problem sets/homework/reading. Even though they are worth a miniscule amount of your grade, keeping up with the course work is an amazing way to prepare for exams. You shouldn't be learning anything new when it's time to hit the books for midterms and finals. Instead they should just be review sessions that go over everything you had learned. That said, practice your problem sets and homework until you can do them without thinking. This applies to basically every single "hard" science course that I can think of. It's especially satisfying when you see a problem on the page during an exam and you don't even hesitate on how to proceed.  - Find a non-distracting environment for you to study. You could do it around friends, at the library, or in a study carrel. But you have to be honest with yourself about how much work you're getting done. If you're falling behind, it's time to find a new place.  - People who get good grades generally have remarkable self-control about when it is time to let loose and when it is time to put the nose to the grindstone. There is an appropriate time and place to party and relax, but part of growing up is knowing when to decline offers to party and get some shit done. There will always be parties later, and IMO they are definitely better after college.  - Looking back at my undergraduate courses, most of them are designed in such a way that it is very hard to outright fail. Even ones like Organic Chemistry and Quantum Mechanics have defined but distinct paths to success. When you are stressed, keep in mind that millions of people have passed these same courses. Most of these courses cover basic and fundamental concepts (even the upper-level ones!) so they are not impossible. They only require effort and hard work.
I think that depends on what your definition of "fine" is. From looking at the list of "post-Soviet" country, none of them would be considered a "failed state". None of them turned into a Middle East shitshow. That's pretty good, all things considered and also considering the whole Bosnia thing that was not too far away.  That said, Putin did improve the economy by quite a bit by using the muscle of oil. Can't really blame him for that, since that was basically Canada's MO for the past 20 years. The only problem was that he let the power go to his head and there was no real plan to diversify the economy. As Canada is now also learning, oil is great when it's booming but you don't want to depend on it.
That really depends on a lot of factors. Because $35k/y is a pretty comfortable lifestyle, literally everything you make from whatever career you choose will be pure profit. I don't think most people who have that kind of funds sit around and do nothing. My guess is they would try to find new and unconventional ways to have more income because they wouldn't be bound by risk.
I think this must have been something they've been working on for a long time but put it on the backburner because it "wouldn't be worth the manpower". Something obviously changed in the last 2-3 years when they were planning the features for Windows 9. It might be as simple as a software workaround/"emulation" for drivers that refuse to work in W8/W9. Windows 7/Vista/XP have had "compatibility mode" for older programs for years, so this would just be the next step but on a much deeper level.
Don't worry, that won't happen. China knows they are walking a very fine line. As soon as there is violent suppression of the protests they will lose all legitimacy on the island and it will spiral out of control. Contrary to what everyone else sees, China only has tenuous control of the entire country so long as economic conditions are growing. That's why they are so worried about a slowdown in growth (even if it's at 7%!!! this year).   In Hong Kong, you have 90% of the population that is essentially nativist/"nationalist" against outside influence. The only reason why China hasn't seen more resistance is because they agreed to the "don't fuck with us and we won't riot" treaty in 1997. If this escalates to violence, you can't stop 6+ million people from throwing out the government. Once this starts, you know that other large cities will start to push back.  Also keep in mind that by and large HK is much more affluent than the rest of China. They aren't bound by the same economic social contract. They are genuinely concerned for their rights, as opposed to many mainland Chinese who will put up with a lot of oppression for economic growth.  Source: I'm a HKer.
The sad part is that there is simply too many people for "low density" farming to feed unless you turned the entire planet into farmland. Intensive industrial farming is just objectively more efficient. Bourlag's Green Revolution saved billions of people simply because farming techniques became modernized. I don't think people really understand that when at the mercy of the weather/climate, entire societies regularly starved to death. Look at North Korea now, and Eastern Europe not even that long ago.
I don't blame him -- getting conned makes you lose your trust in the field and can shake you pretty hard. At least he didn't commit suicide like the guy at RIKEN. He probably had a lot of academics throw shit at him as the witch hunt got pretty disgusting at times. I wouldn't be surprised if he had a "fuck this shit, not worth it" moment.
Your friend is missing a crucial point though -- you can't make blanket statements about medicines, since their mechanisms of action are so disparate. You have salicylic acid and artemesinin, two plant-derived drugs that are first-line use, but you also have a ton of other plant-derived molecules that can't be used in people without significant modification. These kinds of generalized statements about drugs and medicines are unfortunately convenient because they don't require much critical thought, but the fact is that you have to look at everything on a case by case basis.   Add onto that the **type of knowledge** that we have is very different today then it was back then. There's still a lot to be discovered and a lot of uncertainty, but it is not in the same areas as 50-400 years ago. We are capable of more critical thinking today than in the entire history of civilization, so it's not useful at all to generalize.
This was my strategy as I turned into a young adult after college (because being an undergrad does NOT count as actual adulthood). When I got older though, "not giving a fuck" got refined to "being carefree". I'm 30 now, and there are a lot of important social cues and lessons that people need to pay attention to and "give a fuck" about. The rest deserve neither sweat nor tears.
The whole argument for armed guards everywhere is completely ridiculous. The fact is that the USA is one of the safest places in the world to live. It's the media that's inflating the fear of violent death. Violent crime is typically concentrated in bad neighborhoods and ghettos, where the police are reluctant to do anything useful (for various reasons I won't get into here). Violence also is particularly pronounced for certain ethnic groups. If politicians and the police force were actually serious about saving lives, they would actually direct resources to areas where they would have an impact instead of making a big show out of it.
I used to own an LG Voyager and my gf still uses and env2. Those things are tanks. I complain all the time about how my smartphone is now so laggy, but those things just power through with no lag. Very responsive. Even the shitty web browser didn't freeze half the time on a webpage, which was great for briefly reading the news. I miss those days when you didn't have to wait for anything on a phone.
Gonna get downvoted to hell for saying this, but I couldn't watch Community anymore because of the same reason. All of the characters became these crazy caricatures that were only funny because they were caricatures. The jokes weren't even very funny anymore -- it was just being quirky for the sake of it. Case in point: the recent youtube video of the Dean rapping in the opening scene. It's only funny because it's random and unexpected, not because of any actual situational humor.
A coffee maker is too inconvenient, and the water doesn't get hot enough to extract nice flavors. Here's an easier method:  1. https://shoponline.melitta.com/items/COFFMKRSPROVER 2. Boil water 3. 3 Tbsp of coffee 4. Pour hot water onto grounds. If you are really fancy you could pour at a constant rate like those hipsters do. I just fill it to the top because I don't care. 5. Drink. Throw away filter.
