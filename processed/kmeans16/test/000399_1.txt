Aragon had serious oneitis. Could have been spinning that HB 8 plate Eowyn the whole time. She's such a feminazi with the whole "I am no man" thing though. /s
Sidebar please.
I used to think that I dressed reasonably well. I stumbled across this subreddit completely by accident, realised in about fifteen seconds that jorts and short sleeve button downs does not constitute 'dressing well,' and quickly fell in love with male fashion as a whole.
Well, yes. You know what I mean.
This kind of discussion comes up in this subreddit on a weekly basis, if not more. Every single time, a guy explains in detail about why we can't share our emotions. Then some chick comes sweeping in with "oh, but I personally just *love* it when guys open up to me! And I'm sure lots of other women do too!"  If they actually did, the problem wouldn't exist. For precisely the reasons you outlined above.
You have a great point. If you ask women what they find attractive, and it isn't you, is that really their fault? It ties into the idea that the most upvoted response in either subreddit is usually the one that pleases the males the most.   I say this as an unattractive and unconfident male who feels worse when reading these types of threads - but I wouldn't expect anyone to change them just to suit my fantasies.
This is pretty well known. I'd say he means girls who can.
Damn right man. That's the correct attitude.   I lost mine when I was 18, and while it was fun and I've done it again since (... a fair bit), you're not missing out on anything vitally important.
Jesus loves you more than you could know, wow wow wow
Exactly right. Even though I'm relatively new here (been lurking for a bit), I think this subbreddit would benefit from a mentality of being a team where we can beat our problems together - *more* than just a place where we can talk it out (though that's great too).
It's absolutely not your fault. At all.   What I'd meant was that I had unwittingly been an example of how men see an emotionally strong and confident male, and the benefit that such an attitude of emotional self-reliance brings them, and instantly try to emulate it - or believe that they are inferior for not being able to do so. It's a knee-jerk reaction to someone you perceive to be 'better' than you.
Apple in the mouth?
Well laaa di dah
Being in a relationship is just like being really good friends, but with sex. If you're not having sex yet (totally understandable at her age, and it's important not to pressure her) then you don't even need to worry about that. Hang out, go to movies and shit, do whatever you would normally with other friends. Don't have sexual contact with anyone besides her. There is an implicit emotional connection; you will probably be her go-to person for emotional support, and likewise.   The bottom line: have fun. It should be about opportunities, not duties.
As someone who is familiar with Principal Parts in other languages but not English, can you please explain how they function in this language? I am fascinated. I didn't know we had them.
So why comment?
