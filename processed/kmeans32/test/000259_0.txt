And back to you! (We may be onto something here)
The first part is wrong, the second part is pretty much right, minus the stupid part. I wouldn't call someone stupid for their preferences, but if I think they enjoy shit then I'm gonna say it.  But then again, at the risk of sounding like a massive douche hipster, I find lot of mainstream stuff to be shit, music especially.

Yeah I know it's a real thing. But it's presented weirdly here. The way they hover then zip up quickly, the way no-one seems to notice it. It just pulls me out of the relative reality of the game.   Edit: Again, downvoted for voicing my opinion in a polite manner and not insulting anyone in any way. Well done reddit.
That's all good then.
I woulnd't pay the money for one, mine was a 30th birthday present. It's just cool. I love the way the screen is blank until you raise your arm to check the time, then it lights up. Also being able to create and send text messages/hold phone conversations using your watch is futuristic as fuck. Joe 90/Jetsons futuristic.  Plus I've still not seen anyone else wearing one, so I guess the exclusivity is nice, if you're into that sort of thing.  The watch is also basically a remote for your phone. If there's any video or audio playing you can play, pause, or skip tacks using the watch.  When I'm walking down the shops I can put my headphones in and just say to my watch "Hey Siri, play Muse" and it'll do just that. Or just saying "Play random music" is pretty cool too.  If I'm playing games and I get a text I might miss it because I use a gaming headset, but with the watch I don't miss texts because I get a subtle tap on the wrist telling me I have a notification. I can then glance at my watch and read the message without having to pick up my phone, unlock it, then read.  If you're in a quiet place the voice recodnition software is flawless, easily the best I've ever used. Outside in the city, well, you might as well text on your phone.  Overall I wouldn't say they're quite worth the asking price, yet. More apps are being developed daily, but like I said, mine was a birthday present and I love it. One word to describe the Apple Watch, cool.
It's not a bad style per se, but when you compare it to the cutscenes from any previous MGS game they're an embarrassment. I didn't know a storyboard was going to tell the story before I bought the game. When they started I was like "I really fucking hope this is just the intro and the whole game's story isn't told this way."  And so I was disappointed from the get go.
TIL what's commonly called a "barrel roll" is in fact an "aileron roll".
I know very little of the situation. For obvious reasons they're not discussing the details of the firing.  From what I can piece together from the backs of packets of mustard it seems people are more upset about the way the firing was handled (or not handled), rather than the firing itself. They have no notice to other mods or something. I think this is just the latest in a long list of reasons people have to hate Ellen, someone is not heard of until the previous debacle happened.  Luckily I'm currently down the Winchester having a nice pint waiting for this to all blow over.
They really do. The amount of detail is much improved, there's way more foliage and the grass isn't just a flat blurry texture anymore. Most notable though is on the PS4 version the city doesn't struggle to load when you're going mega fast, on the PS3 version that was common place. And the frame rate is usually a steady 30fps on the PS4 version, the PS3 struggled to reach even 30.  Long story short the PS3 was barely powerful enough to run GTAV, and that was with low detail compared to the PS4 version.
I don't get it.
It's fine. I don't feel like I'm in danger when using reddit. It's just a typical kneejerk reaction to people's freedoms supposedly being oppressed.  It seems a lot of people seem to think that reddit is somehow affected by the US government's constituion regarding free speech. Reddit owns reddit, they can silence whatever they want. I almost cannot believe how much of a big issue is being made over this, and the childish reaction from many redditors just makes me happy that a lot of them claim to be ready to leave reddit. We'll be better off without them.  Also people like to use the slippery slope argument. Whatever. What's the worst thing reddit could to us? Shut down the site I guess, that would be the ultimate form of "suppression of free speech", even though they're stopping people from saying what they want elsewhere.  I guess it depends on what you mean by safe.
I know man. It was "coming soon" for what felt like months. then it arrived and was immediately removed because it somehow still wasn't ready.  I'm beginning to think this game is being supported by monkeys. I haven't played for over a week. I refuse to play until Raiden turns up. Even then, the combat is just pretty boring compared to Injustice. I don't know if I'll eve get back into this game. Very disappoint with it from day 1 to now.
I'm not saying there's anything wrong with films made from books, not sure where you're getting the notion that I have a problem with that. It explains the hype I'm seeing. Before today I didn't know it was originally a popular book, knowing this pretty much answers the question posted in the title.
Not me. I always make sure my character specialises in either destruction or archery, for this exact reason.  I thought everyone did that.
Shhshshh!! Get out of here with your lies!  Seriously though I was pretty certain that although I made that up on the spot I wasn't the first person to say it. It sounded to good to be something I was the first to say.
I feel it applies everywhere, lol.
Is it really stunning though? All they had to do was have one guy say: "OK guys. Let's all look left and give the middle finger for about 5 seconds."  Seems like it would have taken a very small amount of coordination to me.
Whoa whoa now, take it Eazy-E. There's no need 2-Chainz the subject like that, and that's the way it is. I wouldn't expect anyone to Bow Wow at my feet. When I'm sitting on the Lil Jon like a Big Boi you might mistake me for an Ol' Dirty Bastard, but fear not, that's just the Ice-T treating my bladder like a Flo-Rida, making me need to take a Wiz... Khalifa.  Oh my tired Akon bones. I knew I shouldn't have been testing out my new DMX at the skate park earlier, those things are Common anyway. I think I'll give it up like I just don't care before I Busta hip or something, then my leg would get all Puffy and I'd have to put a really big Ice Cube on it to dull the T-Pain.  I went to see the Dr. Dre for a check up and he told me there'd be a Diddy fee. Which was nice because I was expecting something B.I.G.  50 Cent is all he charged me, as thanks I bought him a 2-Pac of his favourite beer and a sole Eminem, a blue one. He asked me "How Kanye be doing this for me? I'm just working my Method, Man."  I replied "Pharrell the times you've healed me, made me feel better about myself. The least I can do is Snoop around your facebook page, see what beer and candy you like. It's not like I bought you a Gucci Mane bag or anything."  And then I left. I knew he'd be watching every step I take, and every move I make, and I knew today was gonna be a good day.  Iggy Azalea.
Cool. Thanks for letting me know. I'll post it there.
Fine... I'll say it if no-one else will.  Ahem.  Dat ass tho.
"If the consoles are not involved there is no Witcher 3 as it is," answers Marcin Iwinski, definitively. "We can lay it out that simply. We just cannot afford it, because consoles allow us to go higher in terms of the possible or achievable sales; have a higher budget for the game, and invest it all into developing this huge, gigantic world.  Finally. Listen up PC Master Retards. I know PC gaming is king, anyone who disagrees is an idiot. But the next time you give us console gamers shit because our systems are "Holding back gaming" and "Necessitating the dumbing down of our precious games" Just remember that a fucking huge chunk of the money given to developers from the sale of their games comes from us console gamers. Those precious steam sales you always brag about, the cheapness of the games you're always boasting about, they're not doing the devs any favours.  So the next time you bitch about console gamers ruining your games, just know that without us you wouldn't have half of them at all.  Now let's all get along for fuck's sake.
Fair enough I suppose. It just seems like all the combo videos I see online do the same thing. They show a character doing a combo but done even attempt to try to teach you anything. I guess some of that hostility carried over to this video to. I apologise, you didn't deserve my shitty comment.
Cheap. As. Fuck.   So I'm fighting... some tower. the last one in the Kove looking portion of the map. Was it really too much to ask for them to label these things? Regardless.  I'm on fight 4/6, and it's cheap IMO. Firstly I'm forced to use a card I don't own. This annoys me because it messes up the equal levelling I used to go for in Injustice, but I can live with that. The trouble is Cassie's passive. It claims "All Spec Ops teammates have a 25% chance of unblockable attacks." And she's teamed with 2 Spec Ops cards. I don't believe the 25% part at all. In my experience 3 out of 5 attacks they do is unblockable, and this is all 3 characters remember. So I've breezed up to this point, but now because I can't use my own team (and the passive benefits that provides) I need to bring two cards that are wildly OP in order to finish this battle. When you're stripped of your team passives and the ability to block while the computer has both of those advantages the fight is insanely cheap.  The rampant and unpredictable difficulty in the fights in this game need to be addressed. You can be going along just fine then BAM! They give you a fight that's in a different league from the ones that preseded it in the same damn tower. If this was a boss battle I could almost be ok with the cheapness, but it's just fight 4/6.  Cheap.
Regarding The Predator   If his match win animation doesn't include him whipsering ["Anytime..."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHhCYpnnGoo) to his fallen opponent I'm gonna sow cress seeds into Netherealm's carpets as a sign of protest.

Sub Zero Klassic Skin   Anyone else really happy that this exists? I've always hated the new Sub Zero design. I don't mind the Kuai Liang and Revenant kostumes but god DAMN the klassic skin is too sexy. Feels great to represent my boy Sun Zero with him looking the way I remember. After giving him the MKII klassic skin in MK9 I love the fact they went for the UMK3 klassic skin this time.  Any other costumes you guys are super happy with?

Just saw this on a forum I frequent. I have no context, and no words.
War... war never changes.
Every time I make a couple of posts that get immediately downvoted.
