Summer Reading blues   This summer I was given a summer reading list for my 9th grade Honors English class.I looked through the list and picked out Uncle Toms cabin.I've started reading it but haven't been able to get into the book.I don't know if its just what happens with most books where the begining starts out slow or is it just the time of when I am reading it and the reason why I am reading it ? Has anyone else experienced this ? Thanks

They could defiantly change the password as you know.I bet there is a change email option so after that you might need to show proof that its yours through bake statements and etc.They probably wouldn't help you of you just gave them the password.
