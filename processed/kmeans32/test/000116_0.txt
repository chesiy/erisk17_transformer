Then shut the fuck up about it
How many of you style for print?   I don't have a tablet, and I have an affinity for reading from paper.  I just printed out two articles to read because I'm super tired and sick of staring at my computer screen and just want to lay on my couch and read for a minute.  However, the print outs look awful. Search bars, comment boxes and submit buttons are all present. Navigation, archives and article contents are all stacked and have standard looking blue underlined hyperlink styles. All of this combined takes up two - three pages.  I know it's super simple to do, but I just realized that of all the websties I've made / contributed to in the past year, I don't think one of them describes even basic print styles.   Any opinions? Am I the only person under 40 who prints stuff from the internet?
They are little brown mushrooms.  There are some people here that may be able to point you in a ballpark direction.   You could do spore prints, get excellent close ups of some gills, note the bruising color, describe the smell etc...  But without microscopy,  You may still be unable to determine what the mushroom is.
I would like to ask, does this matter anymore since the user has deleted the account? And if it does, are there screenshots of the threads presented as evidence before the account was deleted?  I'll be prosecutor either way.
Me too, it's a bit cathartic and a bit of an exercise in letting go. I spend so much time being nervous about things, but on an airplane it's like "well if this fucker goes down, rip in peace me!"
sweet find man!
oh wow.
jesus
can confirm. source: i do this too.
Ah, here have an upvote for your efforts
why?
Here's how it is:  Are you ready to be a chef?  Absolutely fucking not.... but  Are you ready to be a line cook?  Fuck yeah dude! You will find your place depending on your current skill, general kitchen intelligence and aptitude for getting crushed on the line. If you are not confident in these last two qualities, you'll most likely find your self on the fry station.   But don't fret! Thats good. If you work hard and are diligent about cleaning, putting out good plates and have a good attitude, you will find yourself getting more shifts and the opportunity to move to other stations. You'll also get an excellent idea of how that kitchen works, who the main guys are and any of the sous and actual chefs quirks.  Work there for *at least* a year, preferably two if you think its a good fit. If you absolutely hate working the oine after a year/year and a half. Theres your answer, no, chef career crossed off.

lol, he's one of these comment trollers, check out his comment history. His favorite method of getting downvotes seems to be by denigrating people with the word  "retard", followed by the sprinkling of misogynist comments and the use of other ideas that go against the reddit "PC".
I laughed.
I think that what their demoing is quite impressive... But I honestly hate this design. The page loaded *incredibly* slow for me, and kind of jacked up my browser. On re-sizing, the site entirely reloads everything.   And also, what the crap is the deal with that map? It's a UX nightmare. The scroll bar disappears? I can't scroll up? I can't scroll down wtf... No website should do that without prompting a user first.   I like the mobile version much better.
you made me tilt my head and go what the hell is-- *waitaminute*
yes.
I said out loud to myself, "Yeah, that's right," to your comment. It doesn't make the much sense, but I'm drunk and even though I just typed then deleted a whole paragraph trying to explain it, I just want you to know that's what's up bro.
Now this is one of the really tough questions. The reason is because "the greater good" is really loosely defined. It could mean simply "the greatest amount of people unharmed", it could be used to imply some sort of "universalize goodness," or perhaps other more specific definitions for deciphering the greatest good, beliefs of what that is, and what is actually happening in reality.  There is no real answer, of course. Unless you believe in some sort of system of truth that exists independently of the world.
exactly. I re-watched this last year, and before that I saw it when I was a freshman or so... It absolutely scared the shit out of me back then, but when I watched it last year I realized how fucking brilliant it is.
you know... I'm going to take this goddamn moment to complain. When I was her age, we went out, and got a godamn fake ID. Or, we just borrowed someone's ID and said, "welp, hope I don't get this shitty expensive thing I just bought taken away from me..." But now, no. No no no. Now, you first have to get on reddit and validate you're actions with some anonymous other people. BAH!   ...I'm a bit drunk right now.
hey now, the man knew what he wanted and asked politely. Imagine he had seduced you, got you back to his place and *then* tried to get you to go down on him in the shitter?
man this used to work for me... but now it just makes me paranoid, and coupled with being hungover, I feel like I'm going to die. :(
just out of curiosity, do you have any science to back up both this analogy and also the general premise that this is (a) harmful to the animal and (b) technically considered animal abuse.  If so, then shit, I've got egg on my face. If not then  Science motherfucker, have you heard of it?
I spit out my drink laughing so hard. I do the same shit bro
I'm sorry... but it is ridiculous enough to wager a guess at who might run in 2016. Four years is a political eternity. But 2024? Who the fuck knows what's going to be happening in the world, never mind who might be running for pres.   ...not that I really am that invested here. You're comment just made me giggle.
It's crazy, I just watched a Google IO talk by Colt McAnlis that got me feeling really good about multiplayer html5 games. I come here, and find a course he's teaching. Today is going to be a good day.
You are fucking ridiculous! I never said that that's what I wanted to do. Stop being such a reactionary.   I even began this whole thing with "I honestly don't **feel** so good about it."
I mean, I honestly don't *feel* so good about it. But I'm not sure if there is really any inherent reason for this to be wrong.  For example, I would have no qualms about a 16 year old bringing an 8 year old to an art museum where there were nudes on display (painted, or otherwise). The line between what we deem as "smut" and tastefully done -- is in my mind -- nonexistent.   Furthermore, and why I asked if you had a specific argument, is simply the question of how diegojones4 felt about the whole thing at the time. It seems like he was alright with it. And if that were the case, then quiet literally no one was harmed here.   Is it that you feel sad because you had an innocence at that age that you would like to hold on to, and therefore it bothers you that someone else did not have that same innocence? If that's the case, then, yes spell it out. There's no reason to go on making moral arguments based on silly little feels.
huh? Oh, I'm sorry I couldn't hear you over your smugness.  http://factcheck.org/2012/10/dubious-denver-debate-declarations/  here you are.  Granted, Romney takes the liar cake. But Obama had a few slices himself.
hum... Surprised I am that this is on front page and not controversial. +1 for you sir, even if this is a repost ;)
