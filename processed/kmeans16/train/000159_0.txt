[Intro] I'm new!   So I was just looking to quench the boredom thirst when I clicked the "random button" above to find this subreddit and I am already hooked! I have read so many stories and everyone here seems so genuine and nice. So I thought I would give it a go and write my own intro (ha! that rhymed). I am a freelance prop maker and love to sculpt and create as much as possible! I currently work at Alton Towers, UK and in my free time love to make Youtube videos [most resent video if your interested](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cj0uUM3fzc4) One day I hope to run my own business of prop making/cosplay weapons and costumes. Anyway, HI!
Pay for one. Ask someone on freelancer.com
Thank you so much! I have only just learnt how to properly speed things up and now I am totally hooked to it! Angel delight is this pudding that comes as a powder, then you add milk and whisk until its pudding-y ;D it might only be a British product but it is tasty!
Thats super cute! Well done!
Yes! I couldn't place it but your right!
I made a Groot Mask!
Thank you so much :) xxx
awww thank you, I think maybe people want to see the finished mask so maybe they are disappointed not to comment/upvote. Thank you or commenting though :)
