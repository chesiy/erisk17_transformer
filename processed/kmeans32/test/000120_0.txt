Ok, my apologies for the loose use of words.  It wasn't hijacked.  I think we're still on the same page though:  wanting to have the cake and eat it too, and we fight any perceived sexism, real or imagined, with even bigger sexism, and it's been total shit going on way-too-long now.  I look forward to looking into those you have mentioned.  Thanks again.  edit:clarity and grammar what nots
LOL!  That's right, be a sadist!  Show what your characters are made of.  That being said, you know they say any idiot can weather a crisis... but that's when you kill them :D
Hahaha.  I remember that joke.  I originally saw it in print in an interview from way back in the 90's, but it was also reissued in Revolver's TOOL-only issue a few years after 10,000 Days dropped.   The band has a restraining order on me and I am no longer allowed to visit the Caduceus Vineyards.  Also, I tattooed TOOL on my forehead.  Top that you pretentious Tool fan!
Yes, I know you know because you have seen the other side.  Thank god we will come to once we have dissolved back into the mud!   Edit:  You sound like a first year philosophy student, but I could be wrong ;)  That being said, fuck those other 'same goops' who don't use their turn signals!
Women and their shoes...
Zoom zoom!
It's still easy to find dedicated PvP in a number of places, but what we are missing is a no-health-penalty dueling sort bell or arena (among other things, like worthwhile covenants, a multi-player system that doesn't suck and take so long, etc).    I was happy to see that they gave invaders (ie, griefing pve players) a run for their money in te base game pre patch 1.04, ie, stacking odds against the invader (as previous games often favored invaders, especially since they were built for PvP) but I was bummed that invasion areas are so limited   The level range thing is a stretch, but not everyone coordinates with passwords to summon super high level players,  and I am all for letting people have fun how they want to, but still :/
LOL
Salmon Odors?
Haha.  This made me LOL.  Thanks :D
FYI - I went to hizzngr3 last night, and not much has changed - though I got just as much shot-gun spam as I did Evelyn spam, so if anything, it was just more annoying, but the matches seemed to come faster than Nightmare Frontier (with a toon I just pushed up to 120 from 110).  I'm thinking I'll back up my toon, then push him up to 150 to see how I like it.  Thanks for the info so far, and I appreciate your efforts to try to bring up the validity and fun of having a higher level meta to the community.
Well, in DaS, there is the brilliant writing that was snuck in there from Oscar (who gives you the estus flask) in the beginning, right before he dies:  he says, 'perhaps you can continue my chosen undead quest to ring the bells, and *keep the torch lit so to speak.'*.  Big allusion to the whole kindling the flame thing, but even then, he is handing us his quest, and the answer is right there, hidden in plain sight.   We go to Yharnam, and we are faced with a similar mysterious dilemma, though we actually know our character was there to seek paleblood (as reiterated by the blood minister).  The difference is, if anything, our PC in BB has a motivation, even if we don't know anything about it, though in DaS, our toon was just rotting in a cell until Oscar came and freed him, and later gave us his quest.  The point is, they are equally mysterious, and equally vague, though I can see why you would think what you think.  With DaS, Oscar is someone else putting their quest on us, and in BB, we have a quest, we just don't seem to remember much (or know much about it) in the first place.  And just as well as DaS is written with that information in plain-sight, BB is written well too, as I think the blood minister gives us the biggest clue of all:  "Where's an outsider like you to begin?  With a bit of *Yharnam* blood of your own."  Dude is straight up injecting us with the dead queen's blood (the same blood that has corrupted all), and thus begins our mysterious adventure to keep the torch lit, I mean, seek the paleblood.   But I'd agree, but I don't think it is the story itself that it is lacking.  It is the...movement and timing maybe?  I don't know how to put it, but it does feel a bit jumpy or off at times, but to me, it also sort of suited the cosmic horror nature of the game.  Maybe it was the whole 'hi gothic horror adventure, holy shit SURPRISE MOTHERFUCKER SPACE SQUIDS!!1!' thing that threw you off?
Someone once pointed out that Wilhem indeed wants you to kill Rom, hence he points at the lake - he wants Rom to no longer hide or block the ritual(s), the implication being that he wants you to see the madness for yourself to stop it, and this goes back around to the Bygynwerth/church split, as we know Wilhem wanted to stop experimenting with blood, hence he wants you to stop the church/choir/mensis.  All the notes about 'the spider hiding rituals' seem to coincide with this, as he is directly keeping the red moon at bay, and the summoning of the one reborn.  But if you interpret all that slightly differently, there is another possibility that the choir (that's why the hunter is there guarding wilhem) placed Rom where he is, so it could hide their dark rituals from the rest of the populace, and as you suggested, the events in Yahur Guhl could just coincide with time passing.  I believe the former, not the latter, but the latter would still make sense in certain context.   I always thought Rom looked more like a caterpillar than a spider.  Also, we get kin blood from him, not great one.  I was thinking that Rom is possibly kin, yet to evolve into an actual great one.  I was also thinking that the husk-like fossil thing in the choir church that Ebriatis is at, could possibly have been her husk, but that wouldn't make much sense, since she was already 'the great one who was left behind or abandoned,' so it wouldn't make sense if she metamorphisized later...   edit:  In answer to your other question, if wilhem did indeed create or summon or place Rom where he is to stop the mensis/choir/church rituals and practice, it wouldn't be inconsistent per se, as Rom is seemingly just a band-aid to the problem, a temporary fix, and not a final and actual solution, so Wilhem's desire is that you put a full stop to it, rather than rely on his temporrary solution.   Ahem, I think we only have more questions now...
Eburietasu-son say, *"SUDOKU!"*
Oh yes!  This one too!
Troll is troll?
I appreciate your sensibilities, and the fact that you didn't decry the changes as the end of the world.   The game is already limited in builds, PvP, diverity, replayability (since it is fairly short is easy), and opening it up a bit to reward players where it's due (chunks from bosses, etc), and to allow people to have fun with each other is just fine with me.  Plenty of people don't co-op at all, and just because it is available, it doesn't mean every new or inexperienced player is going to call in a level 200 toon to beat the cleric beast for them...
Fair enough.
Ha!  I was playing late last night, well past my expiration date, and I swear I wanted to strangle that bitch.  Fuck her and her Majestic Magical Twinkle Sword of Infinite tracking.  Seriously.  Fuck her.  Can't wait to get home and slice of her cheesy-ass twinkle tits with your strat!
I have definitely been throughly enjoying it, but do you remember how much people complained about the number of enemies in most locations?  Yeah, and then they upped it for SOFS... can you imagine all that bitching, times 10?  Well, they did that anyhow, so fuck it, I think you're right.   I've never been that big of a fan of using shields, and after playing Bloodborne, I never will again, especially cuz I've been thoroughly enjoying the darker, more atmospheric places, especially with a torch.  It's been a blast for sure!
Ebriatis is the only great one we actually encounter in the 'physical' or 'waking' world. The rest of the lore indicates that she was left behind/abandoned when the great ones ascended, leaving the physical realm, or this facet of reality. All the other great ones we encounter are either in nightmares or some sort of dream. The inferences we are given I'd that ascension (the great ones) physical bodies are long gone (aka dead) and what they share in common wih the hunters (or dead Micolash) is that they retain their consciousness through 'force of will,' which is essentially life after death, an odd sort of immortality.    What I'm getting at, is your inferences of the cultists tryin to bring back (or summon) a great one seem pretty spot on. It just looks like summoning them through whatever ritual they were working only brings back a horrific abortion of a great one, some twisted monster, rather than the cruel powerful being itself, though I suppose tht could have been "Squirt, son of the butcher's toilet," one of the less heard of and least popular great ones :D
Don't feed the troll.
I've made several replies along these lines to combat the influx of whiny children and pandering little bitches who come in here to vent their insecurities, and holy hell, you can't imagine the amount of butt-hurt and inferiority complexes!  I get it though.  I can tell a lot of them are young men and women with little sense of self-identity and few honest personal beliefs, young liberals who are hopping on the band-wagon of *'combatting the stereotypes of being a man,'* thinking their is some pay-off or benefit to anyone for it, but little do they know, they give themselves away as jealous, insecure, spiteful children.  They are airing their issues on here, simply because they don't know any better.   These kids need to work through their emotional issues and neuroses, as there is nothing more pathetic and obnoxious than an adult child...
I don't hate anything in particular about men, but I do hate people that feel the need to give credence to this post in a pathetic, passive-aggressive, dear-diary entry because they are too chicken-shit to deal with their own emotional problems and inferiority complexes.   It's not any man's fault per se that you feel the way you do, but please, learn how to deal with your own feelings, and take responsibility for your own goddamn life.  Most of this just sounds like childish bitching, and hens scratching each other's face off for a higher rank in the pecking order.  It's goddamn disgusting.
I love that guy, but there was a point in one of his own specials where he even seemed to be sick or tired of working that schtick.  His broader, farther-reaching bits about humanity, social interaction, human connectivity, and the paints of being a parent are all solid and hillarious though.  Worth noting, saw him live, and with not much material on the former, he was fucking hillarious.  Probably the hardest I've ever laughed in my life :D
I got the perfect build for you.  It's bad-ass, sturdy, gives you access to all those tools you mentioned, and you can make several weapons ridiculously OP (though for burial blade, you need to get the uncanny version to be able to put in all +phys % gems and flat arcane damage, as the waning gem slots suck ass).  That being said, Rosmarinus wouldn't be the focus here, as you will top off at 15 arcane, though you could move the stats around, but 25 end is good to be able to use the different weapon combos out there.  Anyway, here is the awesome OP build that makes you shine for quality weapons and SKL weapons, but you could also viably use some STR weapons just for the hell of it if you didnt want to be too op:  40 Vit  25 End  25 STR  50 SKL  5 BT - dont add any into this, as you don't need it for anything, and fuck anything other than hunter's pistol anyhow for non BT builds :P  15 ARC   There is your 110 build if you start with Cruel Fate (has only 5 blood tinge).  You can adjust the Vit/end/SKL to your liking, but with this build and the correct weapons and gems, you can have a 650-700 AR Burial Blade, a 600 AR BoM, and a 850-950 AR Ludwig's (stupid, right?) with the phantasm shell.  Have fun!   Edit:  Thanks to my mate here on reddit who showed me how ridiculously awesome this quality build is :D
Aside a bloodtinge build, which is this game's ranged build equivelent (which a FROM game should have), guns do little to minimal damage, especially on the later bosses who have a billion HP and can kill you in one or two hits, but I am wasting my breath, as you are either a retarded troll, one ignorant motherfucker, or just plain retarded, period.
Lore Speculation - Something I have yet to be seen mentioned in Lore videos or here on this Subreddit   Mother Brain and her scourge of eyeballs that are over-running the Nightmare of Mensis.  The first time through that area, we see those pale, milky white sacks covering various parts of the level and the mansion where Micolash resides.  At a glance, I thought they were spider eggs, after all, there seem to be legs growing out of many of them, and there is a giant spider and her spiderlings nearby.  It all seemed simple enough.  From there, you observe the little iron golem men in the mansion strolling around, as if they are tasked to destroy these eggs, since the eggs have arrows/spikes jabbed through them.  It isn't until you find the hidden area with Mother Brain that you see that they aren't innocuous little sacks of spider eggs, but actual eyeballs, as if the brain is replicating, or spreading some sort of disease or curse or who knows what.  Those are the obvious ideas behind it (the mother brain spreading her rottenness), but I was curious what other people's ideas and opinions and speculations were about this area and how it relates to Mother Brain, the iron golems, and the spreading eyeball scourge.  It's almost like the opposite of much of the rest of the game, where the characters and enemies willingly blindfold or blind themselves to keep from seeing what is before them.  I look forward to your replies.  Thanks.
Haha.  I'm sort of in the same boat.  I bought the PS4 as an Xmas present for myself, then played destiny for a few hours before I quit because it was a totally shit game, but then I got into the last of us, played it on and off for a few weeks, and I haven't picked it up since.  I was just thinking recently, *"I should go to youtube and finish up the rest of the story,"* as I tend to agree with you - shooters with controllers suck, and as fun as those sort of mechanics are in general, I tend to tire of them pretty quickly.  Sure, it's kinda fun to stealth around and bash peoples heads in and fight off zombies, for a bit, but then it just starts feeling redundant, and now that BB is out, I don't see myself going back to finish the game.  I'll definitely look up the rest of the story soon!
I would ignore them, as the depth 3 ones are lacking in challenges and rewards IMO. By the time I completed the standard dungeon progression, I had more than enough materials to make 3-4 depth 5 glyph dungeons, and plenty of insight to buy more materials, and I quickly obtained 3 blood rocks in one day as well as the top tier of all my favorite runes.    Edit; as for the challenge, there's nothing like fightin a cannon armed undead giant as a regular enemy that is surrounded by dogs while a bell lady sends endless waves of red asshole spiders at you :D
Shoutz ouut 2 femily   'gurlfrends who we ignur for bloodsouls addiktion!   LOL Fagz amirite?  My beby alreadyy staurved to deth cuz I to buzy playin Bleedbourne Soulz to feed teh littul faget.  Stupid casul babee faget got WRECKT!1  I tuld it to git guud an now I use it as a doorsttop!
Other Dark Souls-esque Fixes? (Until more DLC, and later Bloodborne)   This conversation came up within a post of this subreddit, so I wanted to ask the DS community at large what their suggestions are when it comes to finding other games that are challenging and intriguing enough to play through, ie., games that raise the bar like the Souls series, or at least, games that don't feel too easy or stale, especially when compared to the Souls franchise.  While I know this isn't directly DaS2 per se, I feel it is in good taste, and could help other people find new and fun games to play as well.  I'm a PC gamer, but I do plan on getting a PS4 in the months to come for Bloodborne, but any system suggestions are welcome, as other people can benefit.   Point is, while there are many fun games out there, few have the risk and reward factors, immersion, compelling and mysterious stories, lore, and fun gameplay wrapped together as well as the Souls series does.  I'm not necessarily looking for Souls clones, or games that are even in the same fantasy genre or share similar combat systems, but just other well balanced, challenging games.  Worth noting, other than saying DaS2 is a better RPG game, but DaS is a better Souls game, I'm leaving out critique on DaS and DaS2 for this post, mainly focusing on what makes them fun and challenging games.   While I'm open to any game, regardless of reviews and opinions, to help narrow it down, I can add a few critiques or reviews of other noteworthy games and series:   Morrowwind, Oblivion, Skyrim, that series:  Fun, to a point, often redundant, repetitive, weaker combat/magic systems, worth their dollar value in entertainment, but the stories and characters were never compelling enough that I ever finished a single game, even after logging 60-100+ hours on some.   MMO's:  Honestly, most of them have terrible writing, bad stories, stale gameplay, and very few innovations.  They often lack any weight, and feel like button mashing with little to no immersion.  Thus they wind up repetitive grinds, even if some of the character, boss, and level design is well rendered.  The treadmill just gets old, and this comes from an old Ultima/EQ/WoW (played WC since WC1, had to know what happened in the story, etc.   Legend of Grimrock:  Right up my alley.  I love old-school dungeon crawlers - for the challenges in puzzles and combat, the change of pace, as well as nostalgia.  Graphics aint everything.  I have been members of Dungeon Master/Chaos Strikes Back/related games and clones communities, and have many user-made dungeons and other emulators and remakes for these types of games.   Dead Space:  Overall, this is my favorite shooter/survivor horror game in recent years.  Great story, great characters, lots of twists and turns, well-written, scary and immersive, and somewhat innovative, or at least, had some noteworthy differences.  Loved that your character was a crafty engineer rather than a soldier.  You used mining tools for weapons!  Was great!   Dragon Age Origins:  Was a great game at the time.  Was definitely immersive, as the characters were cheeky and well-written, the voice acting was good, and the world had some great lore, even if the tropes are old as writing itself.  Looking back, the combat was kinda meh, if somewhat strategic at times, and the levels seem pretty small and thus the game limited, but still a memorable game.  I never bothered with the second, as I was bored within a minute of the demo.   Mass Effect:  While I enjoyed the first and second, by the time I got to the third just this last month or two (yeah, I was late to the party), I dunno, the game just felt stale and limited and so easy, even on the highest difficulties.  The levels and areas to explore just seemed so simple and rehearsed, and at times it just feels like the AI/system is playing the game for me.  While the series was intriguing enough for the first two games, after being ruined by the souls series, now it just seems boring and redundant.    Anyway, all that being said, I'm up for all and any suggestions, preferably with the elements of good writing, fun/challenging gameplay, immersion, and better risk/reward systems.  Saving and reloading constantly definitely diminishes this, but I look forward to what you guys have to say.  Thanks in advance.
