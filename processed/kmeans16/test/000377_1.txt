I would really love a Alana shirt.

That looks like so much fun! Love that after pic!
Cute jeans and they really fit you. You look great!
This is the only sub where I'm not afraid to get mean comments if I post. I love it here and I'm sure it has changed my life for the better. Be proud of that flair! You're doing an amazing job!
I think this was the first step to that insight. Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you. I feel awesome today. :)
I'm not someone who quits   I have been doing Actives C25k program and am now on week 7. For about ten days now I have been telling myself that I don't have time for running. Or maybe I'm a little sick. Or that I deserve to take it easy right now since I have a lot at work. No training for ten days and no food logging for the first five of those.   This is usually the beginning of the end for me. I start skipping some workouts and soon I just tell myself that it didn't work this time either. That I'm destined to always fail. Why even bother?   This time I just said no. No, I'm not quitting. So I had some bad days? So what? I am not someone who quits. I went out today and did w7d2 and told myself the entire run that this is not me starting over, this is me just continuing. This is what I do now. It's not some temporary thing that I can quit whenever I feel like it. Because I'm not someone who quits.   If I need a few days of for whatever reasons that is okay. But that is not me quitting. I promise myself that I will always continue as long as my body is capable. I'm no longer someone who quits.
This is me! I have a 2 year old and a 4 year old, just changed career (used to be at teacher actually) and trying to find out who I am. It's so inspiring to read about people like me who have made the change.  I started logging yesterday and today I have already prepared lunch and logged it (it's morning now where I am). If you wan't to add me on MFP my username is Anthliel. :)
And there really is no end. This is a life long journey and I need to accept that. There is a reason that I have always gained back everything I have lost. The end is just the beginning.
This is exactly what happened to me. Last year I was home on sick leave because of my depression. I was so tired of always dieting and I felt like I needed to just let go and focus on my mental health. All I did was lay on my couch eating. In some way it felt necessary given the situation I was in but now I'm in a much better place mentally and it is time to focus on my physical health.   Maybe I shouldn't be afraid to take my time. Those six months will go by either way. I can be the same weight as now or I can take it slow and maybe be 10-20 lbs lighter.   I love cheese and it actually helps me losing weight. Some parmesan or feta is great in a sallad and doesn't add to much calories. That I can handle. Brie and some crackers is a whole other story... ;)
This is exactly how I feel. If I make just one mistake it's just another proof of how this will never work and that I should just give up. I'm making myself a victim instead of just accepting it and keep on going. I'm going to think of this post next time it happens. Thank you and good luck to you too!
Threads. Either I'm dead or I'm really screwed and soon to be dead.
