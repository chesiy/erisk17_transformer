National Review's 4 Zaniest Claims For Why Bernie Sanders Is Like A Nazi
Or...  This is the thing... you'll love it...   Walmart knows that people are desperate and will work for anything they can get. They use government programs to offset their labor costs. They don't give a flying fuck about their employees, and when technologies become available for them to automate **every aspect** of their business they will.
Yep. But I think this asshole would like to create a new one on American soil.
I'm glad you picked up on the condescension, because I was doing it as loud as I could.   There were only three images from the Iraq war out of twenty-four. This sub isn't for mocking and making light of the dead. Whether or not you agree with a country's policies, it's undeniable that nations need militaries in order to defend themselves. There's no reason to shit on those men and women who are drafted or volunteer to serve and sacrifice for their countries. If you want to talk about politics go to /r/politics or any other sub where that is the topic of conversation and they tolerate disrespecting the dead. You're clearly violating the rules of this sub by ridiculing the suffering of others.
Where's the link op?
Ahh, I see. Thanks.
Senator John McCain was one of the few Republican senators to support the reasonable veteran's funding legislation last year. He actually cosponsored it with Senator Sanders. Trump is a pompous blowhard who has no experience with the military, veterans, or politics in general.
You're having a difficult time following linear thought aren't you? That 10% to 15% can be added to as much as 12% for sales taxes depending upon the locality of the tax filer.   I just explained that group that supposedly pays nothing in [federal income taxes] (http://money.howstuffworks.com/only-53-percent-pay-income-tax.htm). They're the retired, the disabled, and those who are earning well below the poverty level. Instead of complaining about these people, perhaps we should be figuring out how we can help them to escape the crippling paralysis of poverty.
Exactly. He was in the fucking camps. His job was to collect the possessions of the condemned like some evil ghoul from hell. This is worse than a Wehraboo. These guys are arguing that one could be attached to the camps and intimately involved with their operations and still be considered "innocent".
It assumes no such thing. But it does put the burden of defense and the liability on an insurance company rather than the tax payers and justice system. Let an insurance company investigate and explain the actions of their premium holders. If they can't, let them assume liability and terminate the policy. The officer will then be uninsurable, out of a job, and no longer a threat to the public. It also separates the criminal and civil liabilities of the job. Tax payers need not pay for crimes committed against them.
The courts have ruled that civil servants do not have the same rights as normal citizens during the performance of their duties and sometimes even during their personal time. Whether you agree with this or not is irrelevant.   I didn't say that they should be disbarred. I suggested that there were possibly ethics violations that should be investigated. But, on reddit you're not allowed to be wrong without hordes upon hordes descending upon you to call you names and tell you that you're wrong.
Thank you /u/in_yo_mouth for having the strength and courage to make everyone's contraceptive decisions for them. Next will you decide which shitty school we're allowed to send our kids to once a condom breaks?
Trump Now Says He's Worth 'TEN BILLION DOLLARS'
The majority of Christians don't believe in hell as an actual place? That's bullshit. I live right smack dab in the middle of Christian America and I can assure you that you're wrong. Every one of these people believe I'm going to burn in hell for eternity and they feel intense Schadenfreude at the mere idea.   No I quoted two* different parts. The big Mathew part was comprised of consecutive passages, granted the formatting sucked, but it was one part of the scripture. I don't think it's morally sound to turn your back on family because they don't believe the same things you do. The last part about losing one's life for Christ and achieving eternal life sounds an awful lot like the martyrs of islam.
I can't wait to hear all of the bitching and moaning about this one. They're going to have to get pretty creative to find a reason to be offended by this.
Thanks for the info.   He wasn't being unruly. He was sitting down holding a camera with both hands. They definitely could have done more to communicate and reason with the guy. You can say it was justified all you want, but if that old man (as cantankerous and obnoxious as he is) were to have been shot and killed, or anyone else in that room had been shot and killed, all of this would have been a moot issue. Those guards are there to protect everyone in that room and they undoubtedly failed.
Again did you read the fucking article?   It's a development because a group of activists tried using an obscure state law to circumvent the regular grand jury process to bring charges against the officers. This story is about how that process failed and their affidavit was dismissed even though the initial judgement was that there was probable cause to bring multiple charges. Now it's up to the DA to bring charges and it doesn't look good.   Read the article you fucking putz.
I'm done with you. You make claims and haven't provided a single source. To my sources you simply say "that didn't exist" or "that doesn't happen". Sure you can simulate the experience of winning an argument by never actually providing one. You're willfully ignorant and dangerously dense. Furthering this discussion is a waste of my time. Good night.
So murderers can take lives, but they shouldn't have their lives taken away from them?  Maybe you should read the last line again. You seem confused.   Nobody should have the right to legally murder someone, taking away one's greatest freedom - to live.  Murder is always wrong and the government shouldn't be murdering people.
No first I said "fuck you" and described you as a "bootlicker" and as scum, then you called me an asshole to which I responded in kind.   There's nothing intelligent about your arguments here. This case has been discussed countless times on this sub and elsewhere. You're not adding anything by wedging your nose directly between the buttocks of the nearest police office. I don't care what you think of me or my opinion. I thought I'd already made that clear. You're defending two kid killers. You have nothing useful to say.   How dare you insinuate that I support violence against the police or anyone else. I simply pointed out that these officers need to be appropriately punished for their crimes and as a deterrent for all other officers lest they too began to treat human life with reckless indifference. Public canings are a valid type of punishment, used in countries like Singapore and such. Doing this on a live feed who simply get the message out to everyone that killing kids is not tolerated and especially by those who hide behind the authority of a badge.
You're a complete dipshit. The fact that you're even mentioning risk assessment here illustrates how biased you are. The police did not assess the risk involved in this situation. Risk assessment doesn't include positioning oneself as close as possible without first assessing the risk.   You need to understand things dont work like they do in movies.   Right. Tell that to these two gung-ho Dirty Harry wannabes. Don't tell me that. I'm the one arguing that police should follow protocol and consider the safety of everyone involved.   You're a police apologist and you're here defending the indefensible. Will you be singing the same song when the police kill someone you love? You make me sick.
Explain to me OP, how this is more of a failure of the president than it is the legislature. Each time a reasonable bill is presented to properly fund any amount of reform, the GOP dominated legislature slashes and trims it* into ineffectualism. It's convenient to attack the president, but a little research will reveal to you that the bill he supported was defeated and replaced with a joke that provides one tenth of the funding as was intended.
TheCalleguas Municipal Water Districtsaid in its complaint filed Monday in Ventura County Superior Court that on more than a dozen occasions since 2013, a whitetruck filled up at a Thousand Oaks hydrant and hauledthe waterto Sellecks 60-acre ranchin Westlake Village.  "More than a dozen" And those were just the times their overpriced PI was around to catch him.   I'm not going to say that this wasn't a waste of money, but I'll argue that it wasn't a complete waste. Obviously some well placed, relatively inexpensive cameras could have  been as effective as this guy. But someone stealing that amount of public water is unacceptable. Fuck them for the way they did it though. They should have spent $5,000 to receive $15,000 or $20,000 in fines and penalties and then been able to use the surveillance equipment to catch other offenders.   Edit: grammar and formatting with millions of mosquitoes tormenting me.
Poor women do not have access to any healthcare under medicaid. At least not until they get pregnant in my state.   My insurance covers my routine checkups. It also covers me if something terrible happens that puts me in the hospital and unable to pay.   Contraception is a preventative treatment. What about this aren't you understanding? Why should married people be required to wear condoms?    "Wah! I don't want to contribute to something I'll ostensibly never benefit from even if I have benefited from it in the past, and my children will most likely benefit from it in the future. Screw everyone, I got mine!"  Literally millions of people are unable to afford preventative care and end up much sicker than they would have been otherwise. The costs are in the hundreds of billions of dollars. Tens of thousands will die in the states that refused to expand Medicaid solely to defy the president.   Anyone who thinks that health insurance is complete rip off has never been sick and therefore working on the faulty logic of "it hasn't happened yet, and therefore won't ever happen", or is probably wealthy enough to not be worried about in the first place.
