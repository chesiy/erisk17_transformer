Thank you.  You, my friend, are on the level.
How would I tell?  A lithograph would have indentations, right?  Any other telltale signs?
Hah, got it, needed a tiny Alan wrench.  http://imgur.com/Y2HKQwx  Nothing!  Wha...?
See the second picture I posted.    I have no idea how to remove the backing without busting the glass.  Should I just bust it?

Holy crap.  My brain did not even go that direction with it.  It was custom framed.  I've never seen a frame like this.  Apparently, the framer didn't want their name attached. http://imgur.com/Wkz8uIA
Just found at the Salvation Army. Anyone know the artist or the story behind it, by chance? Aside from the obvious religious stuff lying around, I'm at a loss. It was a whole $3.99.
I have had sleep paralysis issues for nine years now. Typically, the dreams that end with the paralysis involve something horrifying (being thrown around a room or stalked by something unseen).  Those suck.  Three nights ago, I had the first one in two years.  It was a dream within a dream within a dream.  I remember waking up twice only to find that it wasn't quite over.  I felt my hand sting.  Then it started to really hurt.  I was on my back, so I pulled my hand to my line of sight.  Expecting a cramp or my hand to have been asleep, I peered down towards my hand to find a deformed, hairless head with its mouth wrapped around my hand, up to my thumb. The body wasn't visible, and I can still remember the expressions it was making while it chomped down.  Then the paralysis!  Finally, I woke up with a yelp.  A literal yelp.  I had fallen asleep with a paintbrush in hand.  I had clenched so tightly onto it in my sleep that my hand cramped.  Weird.
Really dug Resolution.  Glad to see it listed.  Also, Pontypool
This is how we do.....even on a Saturday....I dedicate these to those good ol' alphanumeric passwords I would always misplace.

Both of the men in my life. Anyone else see a pattern? I think I have a type.
For those that do want to whoop on me: test_subject395#1995. I kinda started fresh on the iPad. I wouldn't expext too much of a challenge just yet.
Yes, you do!  It gets amazingly weird and existential.  Two of my favorite things.
Will do!
For some reason this exchange reminds me of the Adventure Time episode where Finn and Jake make the two kittens do all kinds of random things...  http://i.imgur.com/gBrBP1r.jpg  EDIT: Visuals
Likewise in the concentration department!  As you can see, my attention is entirely elsewhere:).  Philip is only 4 month old, so he could go either way.  However, his brother, Bill Clinton (also pictured), is trans.  I thiiiink he likes girls.
Philip playing Hearthstone with me. If only finding an actual dude to play such games with were as simple.
Best.  Ever.

He thinks he's people!
This is Phillip Seymour Hoffman's first day home.
On it!  I finally feel like I want to be around people again!
Thanks for the encouragement and perspective!  It helps to think to the future.  At least today it does!
"Shut up, baby dick"
Has Hyperspace been mentioned?  Or Snuff Box.  Yay!  Freakin' love British TV.
Barlene!  A kitten, hat-off, huh? (like a dance off. but with kittens and hats instead of my sweet moves)

Bruce is ALL about whatever it is you have going on, but he's pretty sure you did it wrong.
This is Bruce.
