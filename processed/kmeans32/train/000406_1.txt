I like the rebel EOS series, but they haven't really had anything new since the T3i had the fold out monitor, so go back a few generations and buy for a discount. But the rule of thumb is that if you have any sort of budget at all for cameras, invest in the glass instead of the body. And pick a side. I like Canon, but there are lots of options.

Which is better: cinematography or painting?  It's obviously cinematography for temporality.

I can only give my own experiences/insights into depression, and they may or may not apply to the broader population.  I find the argument that because we haven't cured something, then we aren't going to is unconvincing. Neurobiology is an exploding field right now. Check out the new research into [TMS therapy](http://neurostar.com/neurostar-tms-depression-treatment/).  But that wasn't really one of the two cases involved so let's get into those.  Strong case:   Yes, you are absolutely correct: getting depressed people to function normally despite feeling terrible is not a cure at all. But that doesn't mean we have to give up there. Just because a bunch of doctors don't understand what a real cure would look like doesn't mean that we should give up looking for a cure.  Weak case:   Yes, people vary. And yes, it takes a long time to cure. But this argument only works within the framework that x ailment can be assuaged with y pill. When it comes to depression, y is less like a pill and more like a bunch of overarching techniques like mindfulness, therapy, mental illness education, familial/friend support, and, yes, chemical medication.
TL;DR: yes to both.   I worked in homeless services in CA for years. The US gov gives out clothing, food, water, and housing for free to those who need them. Not as like a charity thing; rather as a government, from our taxes, thing.   These markets are just like the healthcare market in that *some* food is a human right, but eating at Gordon Ramsey's every night is not. We have a single payer system for the parts that are basic human rights and leave the luxury, tasty parts for the markets.

Saw you on Bill Maher. Really funny.  As an executive producer for a bunch of shows, you know a bunch of stuff that I want to suck out of your brain with a vacuum. I'm directing a 22 minute pilot for my senior thesis at LMU. When it's done, what's the smartest way to get it pitched, seen, and on TV?
I concede the point.   That's not to say that feminism doesn't help men. If my wife/girlfriend/sister/daughter makes less money than me for doing the same work, our household suffers. But I will absolutely agree that radical sexists have co-opted the feminist brand, so much so that the incorrect argument that feminism obviates men's rights activism might be the inherent, systemic problem you describe.   If AARP started protesting NAACP, they would be wrong. But whose responsibility is it to set it right? Should I stop calling myself a feminist? Should I concede the movement to sexists?   A sick institution is an institution that needs its best people most. I choose to stay, to be one such person.   Perhaps you will, too.

To be fair, I'm a recovering suicidal depressive and I disagree with you guys. Suicidal does not equal homicidal, so a suicide does not mean one less mass shooting. And depression does not make one an irresponsible gun owner. But being suicidal does.   If you kill yourself, the universality of human rights dictate that it is equally tragic as any homicide. By the nature of our disease, we are prone to brief but intense bouts of hopelessness and pain, which in turn has a direct link to impulsiveness. This is good. Impulsive = easy to dissuade. Just stall for a few minutes and the crisis is over.   Killing yourself with a gun, especially if one is readily available is much easier than setting up a helium-based suicide, less risky than taking some pills and hoping you succeed, and less painful than razors or hanging. This makes this form of suicide the perfect storm to turn the morbidity of depressive hopelessness into the mortality of gun violence.  The idea that "less determined" suicidal depressives take less determined chances with suicide is not true. Suicide is not binary, and being suicidal does not predetermine you to death by suicide. Suicidal simply means prone to suicidal ideation, considering suicide. So the argument that a suicidal person will continue to seek out a potentially more painful form of death is too simplistic, lacking in the empathy required to combat depression. Do you take your life if the cost to do so is higher? For many of us, the answer is no.   Less guns available means less deaths by suicide, and I'm living proof.

^ This is little more than an argument for apathy. Wrongful conviction compensations are hardly above the poverty line per year. This guy missed out on nearly 2 decades, thats a marriage and a career. I hardly call that sorted for the rest of his life. And he's one of the lucky ones, the tiny minority who have the means to launch a private investigation from their cell and get an exoneration in the first place. The real problem is a systemic misunderstanding about justice: no system is perfect, but one plagued with racism and corruption needs work. We are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, not guilty until exonerated two decades later so we can get "1,000 extra murderers" off the streets.  Maybe an eye for an eye is a bit excessive, but jurors and judges might be more careful if they had to shoulder some of the cost of failure.
