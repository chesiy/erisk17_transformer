Had potato soup last night. Don't have an exact recipe.  Bus basically it had potatoes,  carrots,  broccoli,  little bit of cheese, little bit of half and half,  chicken broth, and some random seasonings.  I've started making creamy soups with part cream and part broth and it turns out tasty for less calories. :)
Could you explain this pumpkin ice cream?
I'm a big time snacker. Especially where I'm currently working. Lately my work lunch/snack has been:  3 ounces baby carrots (35 calories)  2 ounces low sodium deli meat (60 calories)  1 ounce block cheese (120 calories)  1 serving of dried fruit (about 100 calories)  114g low fat cottage cheese (90 calories)  Piece of homemade bread (about 150 calories) - could bring crackers or granola bar or something else.    I think that adds up to about 550 calories.  Which is basically my breakfast/lunch.   If you're into actual put together lunch.  Cottage cheese mixed with tuna in a lettuce wrap is my go to and high in protein.
Think they were talking about StealthRR.
Is the Buffalo rub super spicy?
I started with similar stats. F24/5'5"/165 lbs. Now I am at 148. I've been logging calories on my fitness pal for 87 days. Haven't worked out much. I play pick up volleyball at the local school once a week. And try to go on walks, but haven't done any serious workout routines. I eat between 1200 and 1300 calories a day. Definitely track calories. It's the only way to lose.
Just looked at your breakfast post, looks delicious to me. :)
What exactly are naked tenders?
Thanks!
Romaine hearts :)
I've lost a large sack of potatoes.
You're welcome! I really love the versatility of it. You can change it to your preferences quite a bit. :)
I should have dropped the flour to 400, but I didn't.  I had to add about a tsp of milk to help it come together.  But it was great. Rolled out nicely.  Baked perfectly.  And tasted good. Tonight I'll attempt to decorate with Royal Icing for the first time.
Wow. Someone seems to have a stick up their ass. The food industry isn't for everyone, and obviously you aren't cut out for it. Some of us do enjoy the long days and take pride in what we do. Some culinary schools are a waste and some are actually really good. It's amazing networking, it gets you in a kitchen cooking faster than working up from a dishwasher to a chef, and you can be introduced to so many more techniques and varieties of foods than working in a restaurant because you aren't limited to just the theme of the food at the restaurant.
My first DE razor was a schick krona and I loved it. I just bought my little sister a Parker 29L for Christmas and although she hasn't received it yet, it does have a nice long handle that gives a good grip.
Awesome!
Will do! Thanks :)
My $10 impulse purchase from a local antique shop.
Awesome! Thanks for the response. I'll probably crack one open later today anyways, just wanted to make sure there wasn't anything else I should look for.
These look amazing Nolan!
None!?
I bought some new soap and it definitely made a difference. I don't quite have the lather down. There are a couple areas that I'm having trouble getting a close shave with though. I still haven't cut myself yet, but I'm terrified of the day I do.
I love your tagging system. I always buy books faster than I can read them, and then some get lost in the shuffle until months later I realize I still haven't read them. I may have to steal this idea. :)
Did you text the number?
I've taken my own food with me places. All summer I kept vegetarian canned soup/pasta and microwaveable vegetarian items in my car because I never knew where I'd be when I was hungry and didn't want to burden the person I was dating with having to feed me. When I go to bbqs I always bring my own veggie burgers. I never expect someone to make accomidations for me, but appreciate it when they do. However I didn't grow up vegetarian and made this change after I had moved out on my own. When people order pizza, they generally get half a pizza with what I want on it. I'd suggest talking to your fiance's family and asking about being more vegetarian friendly. Maybe they don't understand it or don't know what to make.
Thank you for sharing what you went through. It's nice to know others have gone through the same thing.   I've started searching for a good psychiatrist near me.   Funny you should mention reading. Growing up I'd escape inside a book daily, but with school and work I haven't found time lately. Well last night I pushed everything aside and read just a few chapters of a non school related book. I've missed that.
To me up north was always the UP.
Mt pleasant is not up north....is it?
I work out when I can, could probably do it more often though.   Slightly afraid of AD side effects, but also against the idea of them in general  - I don't like taking medication in general.
Such a simple phrase, yet that would probably solve half the problem. Thank you for sharing.
Exactly. If I could pinpoint it, then I could fix it.   I'm sorry you're in the same boat. I wouldn't wish this feeling on anyone.
Thank you. :)
