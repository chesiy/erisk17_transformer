I am so sorry to take up your valuable time on Reddit. But here are the facts of the situation. Bryan Cranston, hot off his Breaking Bad fame, get casted in a new blockbuster where he, and HE ALONE, dominated the trailer. You can defend as much as you want, but it doesn't change the fact it was marketed as though Cranston would be a bigger part of the movie. And why wouldn't they? People like me who have no interest in Godzilla, but have an interest in Break Bad's star would go see the movie. You have not made one concrete point to the contrary. I'm sorry you're annoyed, but your position is tough to defend when there are 30 different trailers you could pull up to prove my point.
WHAT.....FUCKING......IAN GUY?!
Honestly, I'm humbled by the efforts in this post and really, really wish I could make a contribution. I'm usually that guy who ruins the on-going joke, so best leave it to people like you and u/MarkyMark8 to do the honors. Thank you guys :)

I'm sure everyone will appreciate it! Thanks!
I'll be waiting at Duke's.
Anyone want to take a stab at Reddit writes Frasier?   I love what Reddit does for Seinfeld, and with the amount of love this sub gets, I have to think that one of you could put together a scene. I don't possess that unique talent, but does anyone here want to give it a try? Maybe to help get these started, I'll use a prompt I used in one of the comment below  **After accidentally ruining the ending of a new movie on his radio show, Frasier faces major backlash from Seattle and Roz who really wanted to see it. Meanwhile Niles believes he is getting a dog allergy to Eddie** Maybe something like that?
To football!
Who's this fat man then, eh? Eh?
Just heard that Henry from Blank Check died today or yesterday :/
You could go either way here. Ace displayed a lot of lunacy when he was playing chicken with the truck. He was obviously prepared to be killed in order to prove his balls were huge. However, you don't see that same kind of ballsiness when he's held at gunpoint. He allows himself to submit in front of his friends and walk away defeated. This all being said, I think he is capable of killing Chris BUT it also may have just been another game of chicken.
and I worry about the dolphins
How did he disappear?
I'm just razzin. I mean, you never know, but I doubt it.
Trace Buster Buster!
YOU BETRAYED THE LAW
Shut your bucket.
No. You're just a liberal baby. Your post screams "I'm uncomfortable by gay jokes."
I said you're a cry baby
Yeah, and wow that was such a perfect song for that scene. You just can't hear it nowadays without getting psyched up.
You smoke weed? That's awesome!!!!!
Doesn't sound too bad. I'll try to stay awake.
That's what I mean by throw-back. The director was intentionally vague about the timeline. I mean, just the use of cellphones and whatnot, we can deduce it's a modern day movie, but the heavy use of synth music and the old-style movie theater, the cars, the black and white TVs. It was done intentionally to give you wide range of impressions and feelings. I suppose that doesn't work for everyone, but I enjoyed it.

Can you please respond to my question below when you get a moment?
Eve was into oranges. Everybody knows that. Duh.
So all who are Christian are elect?
YEAH! Best level in the game. I can never quite make it all the way through without shooting the scientists and failing the mission :/ It's just too much fun.
I take pleasure in downvoting assholes who just post "this."
crazy bastard
Tell us we will die like dogs.
