posted this in ex muslim and posted this in relationship advice   theres a lot to say so i will try to say all the information. i don't even know if this is the right sub reddit to write this in. this will put me in bad light but i need all points of view. i am currently 27. i am a woman. i am british. i was brought up in a sunni gujarati muslim household. my childood was pretty perfect and nothing bad happened. my parents were married but divorced when i was about 17. my dad was a sikh but converted to islam to be with my mum when they were both at school. my mum started to distance away from islam and is one of the reasons why they split up. my dad got more strict. my mum no longer believes in islam. i started to have doubts about islam at a different time to do with my mums doubts. i moved away to go to university and felt conflicted because i wanted to date but felt like islam didn't let me. i started to move away from islam a lot. i became very westernised over a couple of years. i lost my virginity at 21. when it was time to move back to my parents city after finished university i confided in my dad that i had met someone and wanted to see them and maybe move in with them. he was a white non muslim and my dad freaked out. what then happened is i ran away to be with this guy. things settled then my family and parents visited me. my dad straight away told my boyfriend to convert to islam and have a islamic wedding. he didn't want to do that i didn't want him to do that either. we had only been living together for 5 months and known each other for about 8 months. the relationship ended for different reasons. 2 years pass and i get a new boyfriend. he is also white non muslim. i don't move in with him and take it slow. i think he is an awesome guy. i find out through his Facebook that he has extreme anti muslim views and is a member of the uk group edl or english defence league. i like an idiot tell my family and my dad finds out. everyone freaks out. my dad over speaker phone shouts that he is going to hurt my boyfriend and that i need to break up with him and stop seeing him. i shout some hurtful things at him on the phone. he says he is going to get his brother and him and beat up my boyfriend. i say that i am not going to break up with him. things settle down. the boyfriend then dumps me 2 months after all that happens. i move on. i used to be very close to my dad and we had a lot in common. we both like the same tv shows and movies as we are both very geeky. we like the same type of stand up comedy as well. my dad used to really support me and i looked up to him. the thing is since me moving away from religion and having boyfriends my dad tries to control me. when i was young he ripped off a good charlotte poster off my wall for having eyes. i used to be a goth and he would tell me not to wear certain clothes because it was promoting satan. i had a skeleton necklace and he tore it off my neck once. once when i was 13 he hit me really bad with a flip flop because i was making loads of noise in the morning and he was sleeping because he had done a night shift on the taxis. ever since the age of 17 me my brother and my sister would see him on saturdays and get picked up in the car. we would go to the cinema or go to a restaurant and it would be our dad time. i had facial piercings when i was about 18 and my dad hated them. said i looked ugly. i became vegetarian when i went to university and when he was shouting at me on the phone and threatening me and my then boyfriend he said something like 'this is just like the time you had the goth phase or the vegetarian phase' in the past my mum said to him to not mention islam in front of me because i don't believe it anymore and he still did. he went and bought me a book on islam. ever since the phone call shouting I've been avoiding him. i don't reply to his texts. i haven't talked to him in 2 years now. he keeps wanting to sort things out and fix it but i don't feel safe around him and i don't feel like i can be myself around him. i am now in a new relationship with a white non muslim athiest. i consider myself agnostic now. i live with my mum and brother and sister. my dad lives on his own. i managed to block his texts on my phone but i ended up getting a new phone. my brother ended up telling my dad my new number and has started texting me again. i want him to say sorry but i feel like i don't want to bother with him anymore. my sister and brother want me to talk to my dad again. they still see him weekly. when my dad comes in the house i stay upstairs in the bedroom and avoid him. he doesn't come up stairs. one time i was going out and my dad saw me, he said hey. i said hey. then i just got out of there. i was panicking. I'm scared he might attack me because I'm so far gone from the little girl he used to know. i feel like he doesn't know me anymore. my dad and my mum no longer talk to each other unless its an urgent matter with there children. my mum re married a white non muslim and hides it from all her relatives. should i try and talk to my dad and sort things out? twice before we have had bad arguments over the same thing. should i keep avoiding my dad? what else should i do? any questions you have or advice will be helpful. i know I'm going to get lots of hate.
my boyfriend tells me to keep not talking to my dad. i have told my boyfriend more stuff about my sister and agrees that she is a nasty piece of work. I've always felt like the outsider but that could be because i also have bpd.
thank you for calling me a sweet sweet woman
police
i have got a new doctor and will talk to them about my problems and concerns. i had a blood test at the new doctors also. they might not even say its pcos.
fed up   I have always been hairy. i have been hairy since i was 10 years old. i have tried everything. i have bleached. i have threaded. i have waxed. i have tweezed. i have used the no no hair removal system. i have tried a home laser kit. i have used scissors. i have shaved. i had professional expensive laser hair removal. i get hair everywhere. also i am indian so that makes it even worse. the doctors don't do anything. i feel so ugly. i don't know what to do anymore. i can't keep up with it. i am 27. my mum and sister get hair but its not as bad as mine. my boyfriend tells me it doesn't bother him. he says as long as he has the better beard. is there anything i haven't tried that i can do? is there any meds i can take to lessen the hair? what have you tried? how do you try and not let it get to you?
I've been a lot better in the past. I'm going through some things and am really ill. how are you?

pm me if you want
this post really made me happy. thank you for that.
my Skype is firstsuhailah
that sounds really cool. what do you study?
i started crying as soon as he started to cry.
yes you can be my penpal.
i go to rock gigs alone. i sometimes go to the cinema alone. i go out and eat alone. its kind of refreshing and independent.
ill be your friend
are you being sarcastic?
i dont recall the one that he took at the time
he said he will go on different antidepressants
i havent
his dose is 60mg or citalopram.
i want to be fucked hard.   i am in a very loving relationship. we have been together for 2 years. we live together. but our sex life is unfulfilling. it hasn't always been. at the start we had sex all the time and it was amazing. but he is on antidepressants and it crushes his libido and he can't get hard properly or for long. we have tried viagra but it wasn't the same. i don't know what to do. he was a virgin before me. and he is the 17th guy I've had sex with. so sex means a lot to me. it is making me unhappy. we bought a vibrator which spices things up but its not being fucked with a cock. am i being selfish? we do oral which is great but it gets boring. i have thought about leaving him. i have thought about cheating on him. i don't want to do either. should i just be okay with sex every 2 months? we usually do other stuff like fingering and hang jobs weekly.
