Make her lucky to know you
That's actually a good idea. I feel like I can't just say everything as soon as they ask. Would need a few days to actually think and remember how I've felt and make a list so I don't miss anything out. I want the diagnosis to be as close as possible. Thanks for the advice :)
Oh no :( what happened at yours?
Just finished The Stand. DISCUSSION SPOILERS   Oh boy was that a good book. Laws yes. A few points I'd like to make:  1. Character development was absolutely phenomenal. I read the uncut edition so I don't actually know how much was added in but I felt the character development, especially in characters like Stu and Larry was fantastic.   2. The bits towards the end with Tom and Stu literally had me tearing up. The Christmas day singing :'(. By that point I realised my heart was just invested in these characters.   3. Once the mystery of the dark man was lost I felt like the story kinda lost something. It's like in Lost, once the mystery of the Island gets figured out, it's no longer that spooky which is why I'd say season 1 is the best. In The Stand, Randall Flagg only really stays spooky until he becomes an actual antagonist. When King starts writing in his perspective, although it does give us a lot more insight and story in the west, I feel like it detracted from the kinda mystery elements of the dark man.   4. Ending was kinda predictable but thats not necessarily a bad thing. However I didn't like how the nuke exploded.   Overall though I loved this book for character development alone. It's so bloody long that when characters die it literally is like "holy shit". That was the first King book I read, where do I go from here? :)
You gotta start practicing again. Do small things but most importantly just stop giving a shit what people think of you or whether they will think of you negatively. Say what you want. Be who you wanna be and if thats someone who is brave then do it.
Just send it son!
Yay! Good job! :)
Did you watch any yet? Thoughts?
If you've posted about your anxiety. Well done.   I just want to say that a lot of people on this subreddit make a post stating how awful they are feeling and how they feel like they are never going to get better. I'd just like to point out that you deserve a congratulations for even posting about your current problems! Discussing something that a lot of people really don't want to talk about because you want to get it fixed is a first step in itself and something to be proud of! You aren't just lying idly and not attempting to get it solved. You are actually reaching out and putting in work despite feeling so awful. That is honestly one of the most motivating, beautiful things. Literally just saying "fuck you" to anxiety and speaking about it, talking about it, getting help.  So to all those who post asking what they can do to get happy or un-anxious again I just wanted to say that you already started doing it :) Love you all
It's actually terrifying to imagine you are trying to escape and this dude just spots you and manages to get to your boat at the speed of light.
That was quite beautiful.
Hows it going so far friend?
Is it night time where you are now?
I play enhancement shaman and hunter, always nice to speak to fellow wow players :)
I think you need to take a day off just to relax. Hide under some blankets and watch a tv show/film that you like, meditate, take a hot bath, just do anything that you know will relax you. When your fiance gets home tell him how you've been feeling and ask him to be with you. You don't have to talk about it or anything but I think you could use the company. It's rough being alone at times like this. I hope I've made you feel at least a little bit better. :)
And tell me how it goes.
Yeah, I agree.
Most TED talks nowadays are like this.
Chapter 19: Worrying about chapter 20
You are an evil person.
Thanks so much for the response. Means a lot to me :)
Although he was under for long we usually say around 15 minutes is the limit in an avalanche. This person was rescued relatively quickly.
Okay, so this is how I feel.   I'm a 19 year old guy currently on my gap year (year break before college/university that we do in England). I've been travelling around quite a lot during my year off and I feel like my anxiety/depression is just getting worse. I never have panic attacks like I used to but I constantly just feel anxious.   The big thing for me is my health. I am always worried about my health, primarily stds. Last year I did something stupid with a girl I didn't know and i literally convinced myself I had HIV. I went and got tested and I didn't have it which was a huge relief. But then at new year i got blackout drunk on a night out and lost some of my friends. Since then I have been worried that I have it again. For some reason I just feel like my drunk self is a total ass-hole who will completely fuck up my life given the chance. I have no reason to believe i got infected, I'm pretty sure i didn't have sex or anything but I just feel like I did something that made me get a disease. I've told myself that I will get tested again after 3 months but even if I come up negative again I don't think thats going to be the end of the problem.  I feel like I always have to have one thing that I'm worrying about. It used to be a brain tumour and then I got scans and after everything came out fine I would switch my anxiety and focus on something else. But there is never a time where I'm just not worried about anything. There is always one thing that I'm fretting over in my mind and it's usually a disease of some sort.   I just feel so insane. I feel like nothing good will come of me and i will end up as a tragedy, dying young of a disease with stigma attached to it through my own fault.  I've never been to a doc or therapist about my anxiety/hypochondria but I'm starting to think I should. I mean, its nearly been 3 months since new years and I am still constantly worried about having ruined my life over being blackout drunk. That just can't be normal. I feel like I don't like my inner self who is revealed when I get really drunk with friends. I have no self control and I just feel ashamed of myself. The worst part is I didn't used to feel like this. I used to love myself and be proud of things I did, I used to be my friend but I just don't feel that way anymore. I honestly look in the mirror and see someone who I'm afraid and ashamed of when I look into my own eyes. I mean how fucked up is that?  Anyway, the reason I feel like I haven't talked to a doctor or therapist is 1: Because I'm always away and 2: Because I don't actually know If I'm having real issues. Some days the anxiety will still be there in my head but I will be distracted, I'll hang out with my friends and feel happy and I don't know if I truly need help or I just occasionally feel "Sad" because im a young teenager with hormones in me.  But every night I will go to bed and while lying there I will feel scared. Maybe of nothing in particular but just scared and filled with dread.   Sorry for the rant I just feel I really need to talk about this. Any responses would mean the world to me.
A tragedy but all these people are good looking as fuck!
Whats the song? Is it from halo?
Fuck the king!
Just finished hitchhikers series and I have questions SPOILERS   Okay so I have two questions. Was it the Vogons or the Grebulons who destroyed the earth? I don't understand which did it. In the wiki here http://hitchhikers.wikia.com/wiki/Mostly_Harmless it says  "Earth is destroyed by the Grebulon commander." But I thought it was the vogon using the new guide to destroy every possible iteration of the earth?  Second question, is it worth reading and "And Another Thing..." or is it not considered part of the series because its not written by Adams?  Thanks!
Who is your favorite character in any show and why is it Oberyn Martell?
No problem man! I agree with your thoughts on the "lack of realisation" by peers. I always feel like I'm the only one actually contemplating this stuff whilst everyone else is caught up in things like religion as you say. I am not trying to offend religion or say that God does not exist in any way but I feel like a lot of people get scared of stuff like this and religion or the idea of a God is an easy solution. You've gone the hard route by truly contemplating one of the scariest things which is the mere meaning of existence. It is not at all irrational to have this anxiety. I think curiosity and contemplation of the universe should take form in awe and excitement rather than anxiety. Just because its uncomprehending doesn't necessarily mean its scary or a bad thing :)
Whats wrong with the 5th book?
If you could have one thing now that would make you happier, what would it be?
You look like Christopher Nolan.
