Futuristic Wooden Bicycle
Our primary tracking system used a [TK-102 GPS/GSM tracker](http://www.ebay.com/itm/like/161578074970?lpid=82 chn=ps). It works by texting GPS coordinates when pinged. Although, there is no cell reception above 15-20,000 feet, so for most of the flight we were in the dark.  It landed in a soybean field a little east of Stoughton. It was very close to out predicted landing.
Me too!
New record for smallest plant genome found! x-post /r/science
Yes on the bulldozers. The tires are rated 8-20PSI. At 8 there is significant resistance. Today I commuted 3 miles with 18PSI. It was not bad at all. Slower than my road bike, but easy to keep a good cruising speed and doesn't pull in turns.
Partial Solar Eclipse Thursday - screw you weather.
UNIVERSAL serial bus. Screw you Apple.
Get drunk. But in costumes.
Fortune cookies and clams. Com'on guys.
Haha, next time don't use The HufPo as a source. Does coffee prevent cancer too?!?!
Well, with strawberries, you can propagate them asexually, so it doesn't matter.  Otherwise, breeders generally consider F7 lines to be inbred. 7 generations increases the homozygosity to 99.2%. 1-1/2^7 Once inbred, plants will generally come true from seed.  If inbreeding depression is a problem with the genera you are attempting to breed, then you need to select subpopulations as opposed to single plants. Say you make a cross, then grow all the seed from that cross. Then, select maybe half the plants and interbreed them. Grow them up again, select again. Each time you'll enrich in the genes you want without (hopefully) causing too much inbreeding. The minimum plants needed to prevent inbreeding within a population also depends on the genera.  So, you've got some research to do.
Neat photos. Those do look like roots. It almost looks like *Agrobacterium rhizogenes*. That's a bacterium that infects plants and injects DNA into cells. In this case, the cells go a bit rouge and make a bunch of roots. The disease is called "crazy root". No real treatment.
They're up. Cheers!
Oh, and printed in ABS (PLA works) with 0.25mm nozzle and 0.1mm layers.

Is Dick Despommier a nice guy? He seems like a nice guy.
Were they ashes by chance?
But hey! As a first world citizen that ate three meals today, I declare the rest of the world should not grow GMOs. Even if that means not enough food to go around...   A few companies in control of any commodity is something to keep an eye on, but this is a bigger issue. It is a moral failing to not allow reasonable deployment of GMOs. The world has a lot of people. Too many went to bed hungry tonight. These shitheads stand in the way of a partial solution.
There is lots of nice concrete, no cars, and even a skate store right there.  So skate culture is oblivious to the mixed-use nature of State? All the Pedestrians, bicyclists, cabs, and buses don't use that street at all. But hey! It's not like it's illegal...
Bullshit! God's power deceases by the inverse square.
'Tis the season to be rusty!
I took it my senior year as a relax class. Holy crap. So good. Really a dynamic lecturer. He's a science story teller.

I'll be honest, the ID was just based on growth habit on a norway maple. It's a relatively new disease in the United States. Somewhere, there exists some dichotomous keys. They usually rely on the shape of appendages on the chasmothecia and the number of asci and spores. You'd have to google around.  If you find scenescent leaves infect with mildew you may find the small black stuctures. I did a wet mount with those. Then with the end of a pen or probe, you can press on the cover slip until it cracks. You can usualy hear it crack. As water moves in the asci swell and poke out.  It's fun.
Reusable snow cone cups! Worth it!
Yep, and for all ages. Just have a sense of humor and don't wear nice clothes (it's not always on roads). I am trying to get over my hangover from yesterday's run. There was something with apple cider and everclear. I have a headache. It was a good time.
If a police horse can shit in the street, may I also do so?
Arabidopsis preemptively prepares for attack!
Looks like it! Although, now that it's been used it is filled with plastic. That glues it in place. That makes unscrewing it a huge pain. What I've done in tha past was to turn the heat on to melt that plastic, then quickly unscrew it with a small crescent wrench. Be really careful or wear thin gloves. Extruders get crazy hot.  If you can figure out another way to get it off go for it. I'd also like to know.
