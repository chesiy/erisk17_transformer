Seeking Refuge  "Now that Bitcoin exists, we hope that Greek workers and merchants can use it to protect their income through this crisis." - BitPay business development manager Pablo Magro. To fight inflation, Latin Americans have historically stored their wealth in American dollars. The increasing restrictions some countries have placed on buying dollars have left these citizens financially vulnerable.  In Argentina, even though government restrictions were somewhat relaxed after the peso experienced a sudden drop in value in 2014, those who are approved to buy dollars are limited to purchasing just 20% of their income, capping their monthly savings at $2,000.  Getting this approval is a cumbersome process, leaving most Argentines with a higher restriction barrier to exchange their local currency. However, the numbers are rising from $39.2m p/day bought in June to $60m p/day bought in July, forcing the government to tighten the restrictions.  Extreme restrictions on currency exchange have led to the emergence of a black market specifically for trading pesos for dlar blue, American dollars with an exchange rate that runs about 50% higher than the official exchange rate.  Acquiring dollars this way is illegal and risky, so Argentines seeking to protect their savings often buy ADRs (American Depository Receipts), local bonds denominated in dollars, gold, silver, and other commodities that are traded on local and international stock exchanges.  greek man crying The image of Giorgos Chatzifotiadis crying outside a Greek bank was seen across the globe(Sakis Mitrolidis/AFP/Getty Images) No Bank Account? No Problem.  News of bank closures in Greece in the past month have sparked panic, then bank runs, leaving many Greek citizens without regular access to their bank accounts.  For Latin Americans, this situation is already too familiar. Among Latin America's 600 million inhabitants, more than 60% are unbanked, meaning they have no access to bank accounts.  Despite the obvious economic need, most financial institutions are unable to serve this unbanked population.  Fortunately, purchasing and using bitcoin does not require a bank account. All it takes is just a mobile phone, which 70% of Latin Americans happen to have. In contrast to the banking system, the Bitcoin network operates 24 hours a day, every day of the year, and can be accessed by anyone on the internet. It presents an immediate, accessible solution to receive wages and securely store savings at very low cost, with no additional resources or hardware required.  Entrepreneurs and companies have already begun to make bitcoin solutions available to consumers in the region. Belize's Advanced Cash is particularly significant example, accepting bitcoin payments for top-ups to its popular digital wallets and prepaid cards which are used throughout Latin America. This mainstream integration of bitcoin payments is allowing both banked and unbanked customers to secure their savings in the cloud.

I was kind of shocked at the number of kids we had that believed this shit when I was studying civil engineering. That probably explains why they got C's or D's in dynamics though!  I'll elaborate slightly. I don't build or design buildings. I build roads; they're what I know and am good at. However, I have taken two structural analysis and design courses, as well as a steel design course, so I imagine that puts me at or above 98% of the general public when it comes to understanding how the towers fell.   Here goes; when you build a building there's basically two types of loadings you'll design for: static and dynamic. Static loadings are the loads on a structure that don't change; desks, computers, filing cabinets, the actual weight of the building itself, stuff like that. Dynamic loadings are a bit trickier as they can move; people, water from rain/snow on the roof, wind, seismic, etc. You get the idea.   I'm not certain on the Factor of Safety (FOS) used for the Towers' design, but let's assume it was 2. What that means is in a static situation, all other things being equal and there being no dynamic forces acting on the building (a perfect classroom scenario, obviously not real world), you'd basically be able to stack one tower on top of the other and it would be able to support it.   It gets trickier with dynamic loading because in theory you could have all of the weight focused on a minute point, which you obviously couldn't design for as it would require truly massive structural members to support so dynamic FOS is, let's say, 1.1.   Once the first floor started to accelerate downwards, the was nothing that could stop the floor below it from failing immediately after the dynamic load hit it. Now you've got two floors falling, then three, and so on. For the buildings to be sturdy enough to handle a moving weight like that falling even 10 feet would require gargantuan beams. I'm taking beams that are 4 feet tall (looking at it where it makes an "I") and weigh several hundred pounds per foot. Something that heavy could not support itself.   Another thing to mention is the whole steel beams thing. Everyone needs to shut the hell up about "jet fuel can't melt steel beams" bullshit. It didn't have to melt the beams. All it had to do was weaken them. Steel loses 70% of its tensile strength at only 25-30% of it's melting point, which was definitely reached during the fires. For those of you playing along at home, that would mean the building would have had to have been built with an FOS of 4 or more, which is not feasible financially, and quite possibly structurally. I would also be remiss if I didn't mention that our quality control standards in the 70's weren't nearly as good as they are today. Is venture as well that the quality of the materials used aren't as good as they are now.   I know only a few will see this, but I hope it might help you explain it to the layman that believes all of this bullshit.
**super alpha postnationalism FAQ**  -founded as a counter-jerk to the prevailing western attitude- against foreigners, against outsourcing, against immigrants, which i believe is mostly founded on a "fuck you got ours"   ie: "socialist" norway, 1 trillion $ oil fund, huge landmass, still no room for immigrants. australias white immigration policy, americas 10 year waiting lists etc.  -veganism says species:discrimination, we declare some species lower and then eat them. the same thing happens with our global caste system.  -labor is divided. the illegal immigrants are used as a bargaining chip to push down the wages for the local people, and the answer is NOT to join forces with your employer against the foreign labor  -US vs THEM mentality, ww3, hitler. nationalism leads to war over scarce resources. dehumanizing other nations peoples and demanding your nation is #1 etc.   **WHAT IS THE FUTURE OF POSTNATIONALISM?**  united globe, be it under global government or what. people can move freely around. indians and americans and africans are equal.

Well I did get banned from srsdiscussion yesterday because of my post highlighting racism against Asians. Oh sorry, because the mod didn't like my post history. Just more censorship from the left wing.. Is it any wonder I ended up in "free" speech supporting subs?   Even complete ideological enemies like /r/European don't ban me..
the US fight against the Filipino "insurrectionists" at the turn of the century remains a blank spot to most Americans. There are some very good reasons for this. Most people don't like to be reminded that the US was an openly racist major power more interested in trade than in freeing the natives of the Philippines. It is disturbing to read about American heros like Teddy Roosevelt denigrating the "niggers" who inhabited the island, and soft-pedalling widespread torture by the US military (most notably the rather nasty 'water cure'). It is also interesting to read how many people did not value the islands that much themselves, but felt that they were needed to be our springboard to the China trade -- which was going to make everyone rich, of course! It took the Japanese empire at its worst to make the US look like a friend to many Filipinos, and this book tells why.

The plaintiffs argue that, by deliberately concealing information about the efficacy of the vaccine, other potential entrants into the mumps vaccine market were precluded because of their presumption that the U.S. government would not create additional contracts for new vaccine products while the [Merck] vaccine had a 95% efficacy rate, U.S. District Court Judge C.
