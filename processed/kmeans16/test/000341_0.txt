Researchers identify protein key to the development of blood stem cells (Nov 2014)
Microbiology: Microbiome science needs a healthy dose of scepticism (Aug 2014)
That's not only really cool, but it also makes a lot of sense... But 1km of wire sounds both heavy and like it'd take up a lot of room for something with 'nano' in its title.  I was thinking more a compressed co2 cartridge (like a bb gun) that either slowed it down or pushed it down such that its orbit would begin to decay pretty quickly.  But, hell, the 1km spool of conducting 'nanowire' may end up being able to both take up less room *and* weigh less.  Either way, it's a 'doable' thing if they think to incorporate it

4th paragraph   The improvement in condenser heat transfer, which is just one step in the power-production cycle, could lead to an overall improvement in power plant efficiency of 2 to 3 percent based on figures from the Electric Power Research Institute, Preston says  enough to make a significant dent in global carbon emissions, since such plants represent the vast majority of the worlds electricity generation.
there was a [potash glut](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/energy-and-resources/agrium-cuts-earnings-expectations-to-bottom-of-earlier-guidance/article16425506/) going on... I imagine it'll only continue to grow with projects like this.  but ash has its own issues.  applying it directly to the soil shoots the pH way up and throws everything off.   and, though mixing it with compost works...  i highly doubt farmers are wasting the time to spread compost over a field that they're only going to grow straw in
Probably for the best...it motivated me to *not* spend the next hour writing a useless rant explaining why corn, soy, okra, open-field agriculture, etc is the least efficient way to farm given their circumstances. How the density of food could be increased as well blight containment could be decreased by growing in greenhouses.  Why go to a planet that could cost you decades when Plan A's goal is to save those on a 'dying' earth. How the gravitational forces of a black hole would crush a ship faster than a coke can at the bottom of an abyss. How a frozen cloud wouldn't float esp with the weight of a spaceship on it...even *on* a planet with 80% the gravity of earth. How the energy needed for escape velocity couldn't be contained in a ship of that size without dumpable booster rockets... And how if it did (nuclear, fusion, 'something'), it'd be an energy source that could *save* earth in the first place.  ...there were multiple points throughout that film that had me wanting to get up and turn it off and vomit from the stupidity I was watching.  [Simon Pegg's recent comments](http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/05/simon-pegg-star-trek/393839/) on the immaturity of the current generation's audience were pretty much bang-on imo.  :)

yeah, I've seen that video... lots of them actually. but, that one almost in particular was what was running through my head when i typed that.  It isn't so much the transport on that level... I feel that part's pretty well down.  like, case-by-case I don't see transport as an issue. It's the scale, and the number of variables that have open opportunities for human or mechanical error to come into play.  Like I said, I'm all for storing the stuff... and, thus, storing it somewhere that's not necessarily immediately accessible to the plant... Louisiana is a long way away from, say, Ny or Oregon or wherever nuke plants are... ...   it's just he entire supply chain. people slack off. get lazy. have bad days. ... ...politics   other pressures intervene. budget cuts, environmental groups.   f'ing gremlins.  whatever the countless myriad of 'things' that happens when 'shit doesn't go right'  look at the services industry.... sure on a day to day scenario, shit works... but, go talk to a computer tech or phone tech person... ... or just a simple car mechanic... or plumber ... constantly 'things' are f'ed up.  for the most part they work, but on a case by case scenario, each 'thing' has its own set of problems.  lots of redundancy, lots of annoying safety protocols, lots of observation, ... tons of observation.   moving around a train filled with nuclear waste isn't something that should be done 'in a rush'.  but, that said, yeah, I think the basic individual variables are in place ... *except* the long term storage site.  for that, Yucca is a joke. always has been, imo.   there are just too many inherent flaws in it... ...over, again, the salt domes.  hell, the salt domes are *why* we use them for the strategic petroleum reserve ... they're 'war hardened' super safe, and designed to get through whatever the latter half of the 20th century was going to throw at it.  I believe they can even take direct hits from nukes and shit.  like, even a drilling bunker buster nuke would only make it so many feet into one, blow up, and, all the salt would just 'fuse together' and 'heal'.  they're on levels of stability that are so for over a hundred million years.   dinosaurs have risen, fallen, re-risen, and been wiped out entirely since those things formed ... and, they're set to last another 250 million years into the future.   *that* Yucca was even considered over those is beyond me.
I really have nothing to add because I agree with all of it.  my only wonder is: what if they put radar into drones in such that the drone could detect an oncoming 'something' and be auto-programmed to 'take action' (which would basically mean turn off the engines and drop as quickly as possible ... turning engines back on once the 'minimal safe distance' is achieved and/or the ground is right there)  again,with everything else you've written... totally agree. nothing to add.

Cancer isn't the death sentence it use to be  no, but rates of it have climbed from 1 in 10 in '73 when the War on Cancer was announced to 1 in 2 (men) and 1 in 3 (in women) ... with both rising ... and, with repeat cancer diagnoses all but inevitable.  again, why 'cure' something when it can be treated? Cancer is a near- trillion dollar a year industry (not yet, but it soon will be) and growing...   you're commenting on 'they' having control in /r/conspiracy. I think most here would agree that 'they' are up to something :)    national pride (paraphrasing of course)  with a diagnosis rate that's shot up drastically in the past few decades... and with it having done so globally. ..with quality of lives of people... and not just those diagnosed, but all around them... being a major variable here .. ...with costs shooting through the roof (beyond just the cancer itself) ... ...and with mounting death tolls.. ....and, again, it being a *global* 'thing' ... ...I think it's a bit more than a 'game' in a 'stadium'.  but that's just me.  ...and, NASA kicks ass too! just rewatch 'Armageddon' .. you'll see!    working to make the earth a better place for all  speak for yourself ... I, personally, am just looking for stocks worth of investing in because they're going to make me more money. the dying suffering masses can fend for themselves! some people are more 'enlightened'... others still live in trees. one's no more 'evolved' than the other, both are evolved for the environment they choose to live in (more or less). I, personally, am just trying to adapt to the one I currently live in given the set of predetermination evolution has 'given' me.  again, the dying suffering masses can fend for themselves.  (totally joking, btw)
