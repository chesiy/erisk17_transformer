Yeah maybe his parents or descendants had great power so he learned a few tricks of the trade to get by, he's also new like Fish so we don't know anything about him
I was being a bit sarcastic with the Star Wars reference
Our world is fucked anyway
Oh great, it takes a wheelchair bound human to raise this issue  WTF have the governments been doing all these decades?
When will this be available in the UK, will these be available at my local electronics store?
Yikes not much of Mulder but Scully is always very fine x
Batman v Green Hornet with Bruce Lee
Windows Media Player   I am still on Windows 7 so am awaiting 10 very soon but will WMP be available in Win10 as know Microsoft have killed Media Centre so what of Media Player?  Seen they're having standalone apps for these tasks so is there a need for WMP, I have used it for years to transfer files to music device but version 12 hadn't really changed from XP and still had outdated options, codecs and functionality, it could have been so much more   They should have merged Media Centre with WMP and tied in massive downloads services like iTunes, think then Microsoft would've stayed relevant instead of getting lagged behind for many years

Are these things made in a studio or wind tunnel?
The Freak's days are numbered, I'd love it if she was sent down for attempted murder, destination Wentworth and let the sparks fly
Bee as The Freak, mind blown

Imagine not getting let in somewhere then flashing an FBI badge
Lynne Hamilton / On The Inside   I know this was sung briefly in the cell by the old woman in an episode in the first series but I wonder if the full "I used to give her roses" will feature on an episode soon  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TC38KlmnSo  Maybe in the final season finale it has to be played over the last scenes, they need to do a homage when the final season ends and the prisoners all go on to pastures new  It would need to be Lynne Hamilton credited in the last episode as that song is probably more remembered than any of the Cell Block H characters
Yeah but comics go where no episodes can but I wonder how this will be filmed, probably in HD so will look great but hope it's still on film and does not look too stale, the great thing about the series is it had a certain look to it, light and dark, funny and sombre, it had it all
I wonder if Jim will grow a pot belly
Bad Photoshopping
So long as she stays away from fetish whips till she gets older
Story Arc in Season 2   Obviously we will deal with the aftermath of last season but the producers have said that season 1 was mapped out to much fewer episodes as that's what was given meaning the rest of the season was padded out  So they say that season 2 will arc the entire run meaning it will be less panicked and cobbled together so am hoping for a more cohesive storyline with various arcs and can we get the Court of Owls please?  It would drive the whole thing for me not just this season but following ones as well, they're the puppet masters who will eventually reveal the killers of Bruce's parents
She should put too much pepper in a pot or something with her name being Pepper and how about those plants huh, could we see her mixing some herbs or making potions at some point?
Yeah like spike someone's food with poison ivy
Easter Egg Archive   We need an extensive archive of all the little Easter Eggs littered throughout the season, I for one have seen multiple bats on buildings and in smoke and obviously in the pilot with Wayne's parents on the floor shaped as a bat, then there's the leaf when Bruce fell down the hill  The Riddler ? on the cup was the most blatant one and there's the Killer Croc reference when Bruce was sketching in the book  Then the collage of Arkham that Pengy did had the speech bubble saying oink
Ivy Pepper   I sure hope they give her far more screen time next season as she has barely been noticeable in the first season and the young actress Clare Foley is a great choice, very creepy but strangely alluring for a kid but largely under utilised  We need to see her pull more pranks and see her back story with her parents and what she gets up to, Ivy has just as much influence in the Batman universe as Cat but it seems Cat has gotten all the attention in season one
