Thanks for helping the community and the best of luck to you. Sounds like you really enjoy what you do and i'm glad you are here.
Without video evidence it would be hard to say. This is why we need cameras on cops. I come from a family of cops and have been abused by cops as well.   I might be part of the anti cop cj but most of it is justified, just like most of it isn't. Why we need video evidence of all interactions of pd and the public.
They initially faced the possibility of life in prison on murder charges, but pleaded guilty to lesser charges of voluntary manslaughter and assault.  There are two different charges because they took a plea deal. They were initially charged with murder.  http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-esteban-nunez-sentence-reduction-upheld-20150602-story.html  So yes he is a murderer.
I'm sorry, i am on the border of being drunk. If you were to depend on new comments with gold standards you would still have to filter through all the bullshit trolls.
HOWEVER, the video does show several other people attempting to either get the girl off the ground (interfering in police work), or something a bit more nefarious.  Would agree the actions leading up to that point would warrant a show of force, but think he should have defended himself with pepper spray instead. He was putting himself in danger trying to detain someone that was "running their mouth."  The good news here is that no one was hurt.  Couldn't agree more
Traffic on the 5 can move at a fast pace. About 10 years ago i was driving north to see some friends. Had a corvette pass me doing about 100 so i sped up and just matched his pace. We probably went 50 miles at that speed, granted i had a radar detector and i guess he did as well. The vette crested a hill and immediately started to slow down, as soon as i crested i got a laser warning. After we were out of view we sped back up again.  I've even seen packs of 5+ cars being pulled over by a single CHP before.
Got a better answer?
This has to be my [favorite moment](http://streamable.com/ig8r) in the game. When those 3 guys show up behind Bishop, made me really like this team.  Thanks Griz for what you provide this sub
I can choose to comment or not and also isn't what i get paid to do.  If an officer isn't willing to do required paperwork as part of his job, then he needs a new job.
On a similar thread someone posted [this video](https://youtu.be/UvluuAIiA50) and really found it fascinating. Someone replied with a HD version but can't seem to find it.
Yes by "old stone" i meant that in the same context that i stated. OP has mentioned countless times on how he wants his landscaping and showed how he wants to enjoy his "Backyard."   I am happy you used the term "usanians," it should be used more often in this same context. We are all the product of the same experiment.   edit - wow i sound like a drunk asshole... someone be my friend
Ah makes sense then, as long as he has a job in the area it isn't a problem. The 15/91 is a pain in rush hour and i have spent a decent amount of time on both of them. I live in Ontario, when you said IE i thought more like Riverside/MoVal. That can be brutal to your life if you commute to LA or even the OC.  Edit - i worked a service job so it wasn't always from west LA, it was wherever my day ended, some being better than others. At least if it was bad enough i could get a motel room somewhere and be compensated for it.
