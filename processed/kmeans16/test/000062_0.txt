At first I took offense for your comment, but in reality I shouldn't. You are absolutely correct that it is my fault for not taking the time to learn to read a book right. Upon further research, it isn't just me. The screw tape letters is just a hard book to comprehend, and that is the case with a lot of college freshman (based on amazon book reviews). I'm not trying to stray off from the fact that you are correct about my laziness, but upon further inspection of your profile comments, you are just a redditor that takes satisfaction in humiliating others. Every other comment on your profile is mean and negative.    Edit: Also, I made it pretty clear that it was a bad decision of mine to do what I did. I didn't ask for you to reiterate it. I asked if there were discussion groups for particular books where people like me can ask questions.
Oh my god, that is amazing.
Please come to charlotte.
I bent the ones on my z97n wifi motherboard by putting the usb 3.0 header from my case in the wrong way. It will bend the pins so bad if you dont line it up because there is a blocked off pin on the cable to "prevent" it from going in. I tried a straw and it was a bit to big, so i used the mini straw off of some canned air and carefully bent the pins back. Luckily, they work perfect now.
We have the next best where I live, and that is Cookout. Cookout milkshakes are so good, it makes the milkshake in that picture look like a garbage Wendy's frosty.
My new ultra portable tablet.
Funny how this guy is trying to scam walmart. iPad mini ( non-retina edition) retails for 299.99. This guy has an iPad mini retina box, but iPad mini with the retina displays retail for 399.99. If you look at the front of the box, if the iPad mini has iOS 7 icons it is a retina version. If it has iOS 6 icons, it is the regular iPad mini. What a low down scum.
That FPS Master controller, it actually seems like it would help.
Software Companies.

Is it me, or does it seem like gaming companies are taking advantage of reddit for cheap advertising?
What is your budget? The best value for a gpu right now is the gtx 760 for the 200-300 dollar price range(if you SLI 2 of them together, it is a great deal more powerful than the 780.). If you want something sub 100 dollar range, get the 7770 ghz edition. The ghz edition ironically goes for less most of the time than the regular 7770. If you aren't looking for cuda cores for programs that will utilize them (adobe after effects, photoshop, fireworks, etc.) or are wanting to sli 2 or more gpus together then go amd. The 7770ghz pulls about 60 fps on high on battlefield 3 with buffs like anti-aliasing turned down. Hope i helped you out.
It's called boot camp. And you get windows 8.1 for free until January.  http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/preview-iso
Wait for the drop.
I hope I can one day play guitar with this god.
