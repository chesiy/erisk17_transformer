100 million isn't  going to solve world hunger and it's not his responsibility   Countries like Africa need to pull the finger out and start producing more food they are more than capable to feed themselves The government's just need to start caring more about the future than their term in office
they won't take the site down they are not going to give up a site with 40 million (even if most are bots or scammers) accounts because some hackers told them to  they will call the bluff and the hackers won't do anything  got to say i'm getting sick of hackers atm and all the threats and ddos attacks etc etc
fuck i'm glad i don't live in america..   i broke my neck 3 years ago had to be airlifted to hospital have surgery to patch up a 20cm cut on my head (had to be put under if anything went wrong) and spend a week there (got lucky it wasn't worse) getting regular xrays ct scans and mri scans and psychotherapy and treatment from spinal specalists not to mention the countless painkillers  cost me $0 and i wasn't even insured at the time.. they never sent the bill for the airlift so i got lucky on that one
final battle a bit too easy   granted i'm playing on normal but i just finished the game and found the eredin boss fight painfully easy.  i get that i have a lot of skills and good armor and what not at that point but some of the monsters and even high level enemies put up a better fight than him  i didn't even need to use a single potion as it was just way too easy to dodge and when he was using magic he was basically a sitting duck  was a bit a of a disappointment after everything you had to do to prepare to fight him for him to go down so easily
too many years of the drug war has people believing it's the right way to go about it not to mention countless scare campaigns and the usual BS this nanny state country pulls  people would rather continue fighting a failed drug war and keep criminals rich than try something else like many other countries have  it's why they have no fucking clue what to do about ice atm except those idiotic scare ads which have no effect whatsoever
dr google wins again
Williams isn't winning anything as a customer team he's knows that and will take a offer from Ferrari  Mercedes won't dominate forever, Ferrari looks the best next option unless red bull gets there shit together and gets a car that doesn't explode almost every race. Mclaren won't be a challenger for at least 3-4 years and it seems they have a driver line up for the next few years
i was fine with it at first but it got annoying towards the end  every single time i heard Geralt say gotta take a look around i knew i would be spending the next few minutes following a red trail towards something
because people just don't like them and think they are a bunch of loonies  people will always vote labor/liberals reguardless of the shit they do because they don't want the greens in power  this is highly unlikely to ever change
it will never happen
You're a fucking idiot  It kills the nightlife because you can't get in or move to a different pub or club if it dies out or if you want to meet up with other people  The only place you can get into is the casino and that's not a good place for a night out
People just don't find women's sport as entertaining as the mens..    For me it's like watching a local team play as the quality is just not The same  Sorry but that's just the reality of the situation...  If the quality was on par with the mens it  would get more followers
i think people will now see that uber is a evil company that doesn't give a fuck about it's workers  everyone is just in a "honeymoon period" with them because they have better service than most taxis
No butts about it  new smoking law that bans lighting up in outdoor areas starts tomorrow
as i said if a kid is being unreasonably loud and they can't control it they should leave it's as simple as that.. that's the respectful thing to do they can easily feed the kid at home if they cannot control it in public  other people shouldn't have dining experiences ruined because some little brat won't keep quite  it's not that people hate kids it's that people are sick of parents that allow kids to continue being loud or often run around the restaurant or whatever..
no one is getting fired they are taking a paycut on the already high wages they earn (some are on 150k or more)  besides the ceo taking a paycut to keep paying workers the same amount of money is not going to fix anything they would still be losing money as costs would be the same  just because a CEO has money in the bank doesn't mean they have to run the company at a loss that would just lead to workers getting fired in the long run when they lose more and more money
i think they know a lot of people don't like the future crap and will make a ww2 COD to gain back people who probably won't buy black ops 3 or ghosts 2
it's declining and has been for a while it's the whole reason why there was that meeting to discuss changes and why so many past and present drivers are suggesting ideas to make it interesting again.  sure there are fans that love it how it is but without new fans coming in the sport can't survive.  the biggest complaint i see from people who are not diehard fans is that it's boring and predictable, it's not helped that it went from 4 years of vettel domination (even with those 2 close years) to the current 2 years of utter complete Mercedes domination.  then you have broadcasting which in many areas is no longer on free to air tv and attending races costs an arm and a leg and probably a liver as well
Queensland Liberal and panel member Steve Ciobo was unapologetic, saying he believed the only reason Mr Mallah was acquitted of terrorism was that the terrorist offences "weren't retrospective in application", and that he would be glad to see Mr Mallah sent out of the country.  so would i he was jailed for threatening to kill asio and other government staff and traveled to Syria during the Arab spring  he clearly supports ISIS and has no place in civilised society  if he's left unchecked he could easily become the next man monis
don't see what will make anyone spew she worked and saved money and bought properties  any money she received from the family was wisely used instead of been pissed up the wall like most people at that age  I think the reason why people think they cannot buy property is because they want a multi-million dollar house now. Youve got to start somewhere and build it up, she said."  that is actually sound advice.. lots of people are not willing to live far from the city so prices are much higher, the further you move the cheaper it is.. the commute might suck but you'll have a cheap decent home/apartment
proven by the data they used to penalise him grosjeans car braked 5 meters later than the previous lap  it was a rookie mistake but one he just won't admit he made
hes already been proven otherwise he just doesn't want to admit he made a mistake  with a attitude like that i won't be surprised if he crashes into another wall this year
because Hamilton fanboys are complete morons  they are the ones who comment "It's sabotage" anytime something happens to Hamilton
always is at Monaco worst race of the season by far  if it wasn't a historical track it would of been ditched years ago
it's likely a translation issue and he didn't meant it the way the rest of us see the word  although there is always people who will pretend to be offended by it cause a stink about it then forget about it a few days later when they move on to the next "controversy" to pretend to care about
this will probably pass but is this type of vote the best way to do it?  there are a lot of people who are against gay marriage but might not ever say it in public.. voting like this allows them to vote no without anyone else knowing
Hamilton screwed up at the start and had a shit pit stop vettel didn't ruin anything
the event isn't registering my scores got 4.7 million but it didn't register  http://i57.tinypic.com/166zync.png  fuck this game has been really glitched recently  edit-- getting a message leaderboard data unavailable that might be why it's not showing
that one actually sounds good but i don't think i've ever got a ben riley one  lost many combos the extra 4 seconds sounds pretty good
silver medal now impossible to get   they changed the rank required for silver medal it's now 10-99 (bronze is 100-9999) not only impossible for those with lower multipliers but a bit unfair on people who get high scores that get screwed over with a bronze medal  i think they increased it because it's 50 ISO-8 but it's hard to achieve i wouldn't mind if it was less ISO-8 so more people could actually have a chance to earn it
Anyone playing spiderman unlimited?   downloaded it the other day it was fun at first but when you get up to the missions that require a level 35 spiderman the game gets ridiculous  the amount of iso-8 you need to level up is ridiculous and you got to be lucky to get 4-5 of the same premium card and another 2 to level them up  obviously geared to get people to pay otherwise it would take months to even get enough (other endless runner games aren't this bad)  takes away from the fun of the game when you hit a roadblock like this
who else doesn't want a event so soon?   i hate when games put big events out so soon, events need to be spaced out so you don't get tired of the game and this one most likely will be similar to the last with collect x to get y or spend a zillion clams to get it now..  too many events so soon and you get burned out on the game (especially since many are probably still unlocking stewie or trying to get the toy boxes)
