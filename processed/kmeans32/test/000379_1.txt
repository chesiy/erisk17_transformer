I don't really give a shit who I tell. I mean I don't just go around telling everyone, I have to know them enough to be generally comfortable. But if I'm feeling depressed and someone asks me what's wrong I'll tell them that I have depression and want to just be alone.
I'm terribly sorry to see this. No one deserves this pain. I'm experiencing something fairly similar unfortunately. I was with this amazing girl, we were fantastic. I knew she had depression and other issues, but I wasn't ready for her to get depressed then break up with me because she didn't feel able to be with someone. I've unfollowed her on Facebook but every once in a while I can't stop myself from looking and every time I look I experience heart shattering pain. She doesn't advertise relationships on Facebook, or her feelings all that much for that matter but when I look I'm just crushed that she isn't experiencing things with me. But this happened before and she may come back to me like she did before, but until that happens I'm afraid I'll feel this way. This extreme feeling of love and missing her. To make it worse, this all began when my depression and anxiety starting to really "bud" if you will.
I deal with this practically everyday. Everyday it's a struggle. Honestly, what I do is just tell myself that I need to. I might have nothing to to do that day, but to be a real member of society I need to get the fuck out of bed.
Everything.
Looks like I'm fucked then.
Well in a sense they are, aren't they? They're contributing to the larger collection of media which does shape and define us as a nation (I assume you're talking about American filmmakers). I mean I hate these pretentious douchebags as much as anyone, but they are contributing. I may not be in a significant way but they are
Reflexive property, everything is equal to itself.
Is it bad that I'm pretending that this is the girl who broke up with me like a month ago? Probably.
Can anyone identify the shoes Belson wears in S2E5?   The shoes I'm referring to are the ones he wears during the talk when he announces that they will be streaming the UFC fight.
A dance club like with a bar, dance floor and obnoxious, loud music
Any particular reason you feel this way?
Yeah, it would serve drinks. I thought about getting a job at a club, but I life in a rural area so there aren't any around, which is one reason why I had the idea.
Looking for some basic advice on starting a business.   Brand new to this sub, so I have super limited knowledge. I'm an 18 year-old who is considering starting a dance club in my local urban area which allows 18+ patrons. I'm going to take a class on entrepreneurship next semester, but I was curious if you guys had any advice on how to get this all started. I was thinking market research to see if it was even worth pursuing?
A group which contains a physicist, a priest, a doctor, psychologist and an atheist are permitted to ask God 3 questions. What do they ask?   No follow-ups, and each of them is thinking only in terms of their designated title within the group (ie, the physicist is only thinking in terms of physics).
Kyle or Chad. I've never met anyone named Kyle or Chad who wasn't a douchebag
I think that this happened to show that despite the attributes I described he's still a human, and humans fuck up.
I actually respect Frank a great deal. He does what the fuck he wants and gets what he wants despite all obstacles. This doesn't change the fact that he's an awful human being though. I think that one thing the show does really well is showing that despite him being an awful person we all want to be like Frank, at least a little bit. Everyone wants to be strong willed, intelligent, cunning, clever and ambitious. But everyone also wants to be a good person, unlike Frank. Frank doesn't give a fuck.
I met them all....
This is too accurate..
Has Ubisoft made an announcement about the frame rate and/or other issues?   With all the buzz about the issues with Unity, the frame rate issues in particular, I'd expect Ubi to say something about it. Have they said anything about upcoming patches or anything?
Are we in a universe with separate sections of different waves?   If over time waves lose energy and speed, does that mean that there are separate sections for waves of separate wavelengths? I'm thinking this because if if an X-ray were to lose energy over time and become a radio wave,  wouldn't it be moving at the same rate as all other radio waves created near the same time? Then over time, wouldn't there be a huge difference in the number of radio waves and all other wavelengths?
I don't mean to be mean  but I'll make you my queen  if you suck on my peen  I keep it very clean  and it's really quite lean  I'm sorry it's green  I got a bad gene  but to counter the green, it has a nice sheen  I'll be honest, I'll become quite keen  if only you only  just suck on my peen
Is it possible for an hallucination to kill you?
I'm not sure how I feel about seeing this in my Psychology teacher's classroom.
This pretty much sums up my entire life. At least I have reddit, where I know everyone hates everyone!
To my Social Studies teacher.

Reddit, what is something that is crazy enough that it might just work?
Thanks for all the help guys!!
Thanks, that was really clear and easily understood. The video also helped a lot.
Why is it while being accelerated bodies gain mass? Also, why is it that it would take infinite energy to raise a body to the speed of light even though the speed of light is an exact number?
I met him as well. I was really young, 5 or 6 maybe and he was shooting a movie near where I lived so my dad brought me over there and told me  "That's the Genii from Aladdin!!". I, being a 5 year old, immediately ran over to meet him. As I was running over, a van with some sort of film equipment was coming by and was going to hit me. Robin yelled at the same time as my dad for me to stop. Robin Williams saved my life, then afterward, we had a little conversation about watching for cars. Meanwhile, my stupid older brother sat in the car and listened to music.
