HTC is planning to unveil a new smartphone featuring improved camera and audio capabilities, as well its first smartwatch during the upcoming Mobile World Congress (MWC), scheduled for the first week of March in Barcelona, Spain.
Solar power has come a long way from powering calculators to small electronics and now our homes, businesses and possibly the country. Currently roof top solar panels are dominating the solar industry and have become its flag carrier.
Using digital technologies does not directly cause stress, but social media can increase awareness of problems facing friends and family, and this stress is "contagious,".
Previous techniques to align the nanotubes resulted in less-than-desirable packing density, or how close the nanotubes are to one another when they are assembled in a film. However, the University of Wisconsin-Madison materials engineers pioneered a new technique, called floating evaporative self-assembly, or FESA, which they described earlier in 2014 in the ACS journal Langmuir. In that technique, researchers exploited a self-assembly phenomenon triggered by rapidly evaporating a carbon nanotube solution.
Australian National University Made Quantum Hard Drive Breakthrough
Competitors are already starting to take notice  earlier this week the French space agency, CNES, announced plans to develop its own reusable rocket tech. And in the long term, the ability to land a rocket on solid ground will assist in Musk's ultimate goal: colonising Mars.
Quantum computing is seen as the next stage in technological development, not only on the processing level but that of storage space as well. It is the latter area where a team of scientists from the Australian National University has made a breakthrough.
Experts rank the most popular diets, but you might not have heard of the top three
In order to develop future quantum computer networks, it is necessary to hold a known number of atoms and read them without them disappearing. To do this, researchers from the Niels Bohr Institute have developed a method with a trap that captures the atoms along an ultra thin glass fiber, where the atoms can be controlled. The results are published in the scientific journal, Physical Review Letters.
The 25-year-old skipper is in exclusive company. He is the fifth Australian batsman to make centuries in four or more consecutive Tests, after Don Bradman, Neil Harvey, Jack Fingleton and Matthew Hayden. Smith also joins Bradman and Jacques Kallis as the only players to score four consecutive hundreds in the same series.
Sonys plans to re-invent the Walkman as a high-end, and very highly-priced, music player could be limited by the fact that people cant really tell the difference between it and an iPhone, according to tests.
New guidance report that aims to help decision makers understand and navigate the myriad choices within the big data designation, including data domains, compute and storage infrastructures, data analytics, visualization, security and privacy.
Until now, synthetic organisms have been developed and commercialized without international regulations; increasing numbers of synthetically-derived products are making their way to market. The CBDs decision is regarded as a starting signal for governments to begin establishing formal oversight for this exploding and controversial field.
Habitat loss due to agriculture has caused the insects population to fall 90% in 20 years, prompting the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to consider protecting monarch butterflies under the Endangered Species Act.
A team of researchers at Harvard, the University of California, Santa Barbara and the University of Chicago has taken a major step forward in effectively enhancing the fluorescent light emission of diamond nitrogen vacancy centers - a key step to using the atom-sized defects in future quantum computers
