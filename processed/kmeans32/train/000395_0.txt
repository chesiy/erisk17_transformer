So it is. I hope you do, as well.
They are *not* ripping out the penis in the gif. I've raised goats and can assure you of that.
They've got their hand in everything. I'm writing an article (hopefully I'll finish...) about the [AFFH](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/07/08/obama-administration-to-unveil-major-new-rules-targeting-segregation-across-u-s/) rule just released and how we don't need federal controls, just remove the ones that have put us in this screwed up position.
Those rims are looking a little bright...
Other luminaries include Allan Savory and Mark Shepard. I've seen that Bill Mollison understood most of what these men practice now and Geoff Lawton helps spread news about and teach people.  We can feed the world, but it will mean making farms more labor-intensive. That isn't a bad thing, because done correctly it is healthy and fulfilling work, but people are used to seeing robotic harvesters raoming across the plains scooping up grains. Raising a head of cattle will take much less land and water and almost only the land the herd grazes on will be included in the process. No more taking into consideration the roads between the grains in Iowa and the industrial ranches in Colorado or the water rights in Nevada for the farm in California. With more people on the land those dying midwest towns will liven up, increasing opportunity and prosperity. The deserts of the Southwest can be restored through management by slowing down the water that currently flash-floods away.  How much more valuable would the land we currently till for corn be if it didn't take so many material inputs? How much more affordable would meat and whole food be if it was produced by many more people rather than a few strings of corporate farms?
Hey! I remember when it was called "Cranberry Mall" and had a Babbage's. There have been a few gamer-oriented stores in the past few years. I got a link to [Save Point's](http://savepointmd.com/) website off the directory.  Didn't see any of the other stores there, they probably closed up.  Edit: If OP contacts the staff, they'll probably have a lead on a machine even if they don't have it in.
I'm a libertarian, too.  Let me rephrase that first sentence to be more legible: Am I forcing my morals, or, are we both simply voicing opinions?  Nothing I have said *makes* people do anything, but it does let them know I disapprove. That isn't violence and it isn't force.
peoples taxes (majority anyways) are paid through their employer.   Exemptions can be requested... it would probably be rescinded after the first offense. That is why it would have to be coordinated. The government is made to act like it owns our money and lets us keep some. Overloading the system to the point where it will only operate if terribly simplified might be an avenue to correction.  The government is staffed by people and tied together by perception. One perception that keeps it aflaot is the perception that enforcers are doing the right thing (this is important within the ranks of enforcers and in the general citizenry, of course). Since this is usually incorrect at some level, administrators have two options to keep the perception alive. They can either walk back the control or lash out and justify actions later.  With the ranch, the government had made a mistake *somewhere,* so they had to stop the hardball. If I remember correctly, it was with not enforcing the arrangement more formally and immediately. Maybe it flew under the radar for a while before someone noticed - I don't recall. Nobody thinks FBI and LMB agents dieing over scrubland will solve anything.
The thing is, how are you going to prove it works to convince people?  You cannot expect stable, reasonable, people to trust a system will be better without proof of the final result. Especially when the change will be complete and total.  You are saying that you can't even concieve of success if less than the entire world is transformed. Are you sure? Maybe a region or a medium sized country? (This is in the context of the reddit post, where there would hypothetically be no armed opposition, nor ideological opposition) Can you concieve of there being a placenta-like interface at the theoretical place where the two meet? Inside the geographical area, socialism with no property rights. Outside, anarchy with other socialist groups.  I think I know what you should say, though I'll tell you if you reply so I don't spoil it.  It sounds like you saying socialism has no way to protect from anti-social elements, or are you conceding that socialism is not good enough to prove itself in the face of no opposition.
There is substantial data on soil erosion by open field agriculture all the way back to the desertification of the fertile crescent. Our ancestors cut down all the trees and tilled all the soil until it ran into the rivers and silted them up, then once the land was purged of organic matter it stopped holding water to regulate rivers and became desert with flash floods. This happened in Greece, China, Asia Minor, the Tiber River valley, and almost happened in the American Colonies. Ur, Ostia, and Joppatowne were all ports - now they are 150, 20, and 3 miles inland, respectively.  Oh, and the cities buried in the Sahara were screwed by a change in the axis of the earth. Its there in the archaeological record.

Marylanders, come enjoy a night with Sen. Rand Paul, Dr. Alveda King, Dan Bongino, and Derek Hunter at Martin's West, June 9th! Special rate til after the 30th.   I am sorry this is on such short notice, but if you haven't noticed, Senator Rand Paul is very busy running for president and helping to stop the ongoing crisis against civil liberties in America.  There is a special rate for students and dinner is absolutely included in all tickets. VIP ticket purchasers should bring a camera(phone) for a quick pic with Rand as he signs your copy of his new book. [The information is available on this printable PDF.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2fMf8VPLmNZNUYtZ2d2UFBIaWc/view?usp=sharing) Ticket prices go up after the 30th... Tomorrow!  Hi, I'm youngest member of the BCRCC! Make a comment in the comment box when you purchase online saying *Patron Vectras* sent you and that doesn't mean you have to sit with me, but it will be nice to say hello. The only benefit I will possibly get is an uprage to VIP ticket if enough credit me. If that happens I may hand it off if you ask nicely since I should really be helping seat people and set up.

Have you ever read about [Molinism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molinism)?  Just because the decision is known does not predetermine free will. It merely highlights the limits of humanity.  I do not mean to bring this up as a religious point. I am thinking of it in the context of a non-supernatural world where we merely cannot access the knowledge yet, if ever.
Yeah, this guy was all "We can do everything without a government, which even the founders called a necessary evil... so why have a government?"  Watched a bunch of lectures on Youtube and then /r/Anarcho_Capitalism .  But just like President Vit J. I'm willing to be practical. Hell, I'm a member of the local Republican Central Committee. They do not know me so well as to know my inclinations.
You Get What You Pave For | A look at how one spread out southern city has problems funding utilities.   [The article](http://theind.com/article-20971-You-Get-What-You-Pave-For.html) says taxpayers can expect to pay much more in taxes each year, or the city has to find another solution.  [Strong Towns](http://www.strongtowns.org/) is spearheading this kind of wake-up for towns and cities. The suburbs have not paid for themselves in taxes, it turns out.  Any fun stories about moving to a town before you found out it was in trouble?
One previous post which was about the rash ended with OP discovering a macadamia nut allergy. Keto rash looks exactly like when I eat coconut protein (I have to use refined coconut oil - which is a shame because I love the taste!).  Red and slightly puffy, itchy but forgettable, and lasts for weeks. Seems to appear above the diaphram and below or between the pectoral muscles/ adipose deposits. All in all not fun, but I can't say that is what you are experienceing for sure and I have not found a way to end the reaction faster. I also have no idea what a protein allergy can do to your kidneys, if anything.  I can tell you that I survive instances without cortisol because if there is one thing I hate more than an itch it is a smelly, sticky undershirt.  Check your recent diet for new types of dietary proteins you may have eaten.
Do you admire America, or do you LOVE HER?
yeah, we'd have to use an even cooler word. It would go right along with "incarnate," "consubstantial," and such.
[National Park Service] Ecological Mismanagement at Point Reyes: By Design?
A dark side force wielder could maintain a heroic outlook on life, doing what would be generally considered right, albeit in brutal and rash ways.  Or, at least, a heroic image to his acquaintance and superiors. Even Anakin could not hide his darkness from his loved ones for long.  The linked story is a good example of what you could expect from a Sith "hero." There is a short intro plot in the first five minutes and a then a longer one which goes for the whole.

Then they were in keto.  Edit: I looked up more info and have decided it is probably true they were not. It seems a well-researched thing.
If it isn't now, it will be, imo.
Subbing.  I grew up in the [Christopher Erb house](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Erb_House) in Maryland. Let me know if you want a post about it.  200yr old stone German immigrant house. Basement is center wall, the two stories and attic above are center hallway. Our floors are so crooked. There is a sister house and my personal theory is that the Erbs started to make a split floorplan but saw [Hampton Mansion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampton_National_Historic_Site) after finishing the basement and decided to change the plan.  Not until I happened upon a book about the similarities between the [Zwaanendael Museum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zwaanendael_Museum) and the building it (in part) replicates did I know about jointery markings. The specialized language of rafter joining. I'd been sleeping under the exposed rafters for years.  The house is a form of Georgian colonial architecture.
[No no no, that comes out the *front end.*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGwibPdEOVk)
If he is labelled as inherently threatening, that could be the immediate conclusion.  The extreme example brings to mind a lone hero riding to the gates of the walled city of Liberland... half dead on his horse. He comes bearing important news but is turned away or shot with an arrow...  In real life, if you want to come back just ask to speak to a diplomat. Showing up at your ex-spouse's front door asking to be let back in isn't the right way to do things.  (not that govt is a spouse to anyone. blech.)
Invictus   Out of the night that covers me,  Black as the pit from pole to pole,  I thank whatever gods may be  For my unconquerable soul.  -  In the fell clutch of circumstance  I have not winced nor cried aloud.  Under the bludgeonings of chance  My head is bloody, but unbowed.  -  Beyond this place of wrath and tears  Looms but the Horror of the shade,  And yet the menace of the years  Finds and shall find me unafraid.  -  It matters not how strait the gate,  How charged with punishments the scroll,  I am the master of my fate,  I am the captain of my soul.  -  William Ernest Henley, at age 26
I love this sub.   Look at all these great posts with active discussion. I was just rolling down looking around, adding tabs to go read them and I muttered out loud... I love this sub. My eye had caught how many had lots of comments and I knew most would be productive to the participants.  My wife was walking to the kitchen for a glass of OJ and was like, "hmm?"  I just wanted to say that even just viewing the activity here makes me feel on top of things, which is all some of us want so I and mine can jump on a good opportunity to help or flee.
