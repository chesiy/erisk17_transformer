"There was also a large horse in the room, taking up most of it."
Yes! Also, mix it with baking soda and a little crushed oregano and it's a good underarm antiperspirant/deodorant. I tried this combo in the downstairs region too, but it seemed to cause irritation so I switched back to just cornstarch for that area.
I was going to say "Every Ferengi episode" but that doesn't even qualify as an interesting concept. The Ferengi are OK in episodes where they're antagonists, but the on-world political and Quark's-family crap was unbearable.
Oxygen and magnesium together? OMg!
Well, fuck a duck.
This is the main factor. As it happens the textbook companies seem to be pricing more aggressively than they were when I was in school, too. But state cutbacks are the prime mover.

NO NEW WORDS! ONLY OLD WORDS!
Floss.
When I say "the system is heavily biased" that's probably right. In most fields there's a quite reasonable assumption that if you enter the a PhD program you're looking for an institutional teaching or research career, since that's what they're there to prepare people for, and going a different route takes extra effort.
In FW there's a stretch of Magnolia street that has a bunch of good restaurants. There's even a vegan place that for my money has the best food in the area, and I'm not vegan.   If you can find a taco place that makes its own tortillas, go to town. There's nothing like a fresh taco on a tortilla that's only about a minute old. (Soft tacos are the norm; I'm not even sure where you could get a crunchy taco besides Taco Bell.)
Yesterday I met some friends for coffee, and someone had written on the coffeehouse chalkboard, "Word of the day: Sonder." I looked it up and *sonder* is exactly what you said: The fleetingness of our minuscule presence in most others' lives.  So it's kind of cool that you came up with the same concept shortly afterward and then I read it.  Well, see you around, or probably not, actually.

It sounds as if you want to say "The experience has made me a much better person" but you don't feel that way. It's OK, it's early in the process. Reading some of the stories in this thread, some of them sound as if the light just came on and they were cool people all of a sudden. I can assure you, it didn't happen that fast. It never does. We all have to *learn* to be good people, over the course of weeks and months and years. You feel like the Guy Who Did That Shitty Thing; eventually you'll feel like the Guy Who Grew From That Shitty Thing. It won't be tomorrow, but it will be before too long.
Maybe you're running too fast during the running parts? It's way too easy to just charge out there, because dangit I'm *running* and that means going fast. (There are involuntary physiological aspects as well.) You should be able to easily carry on a conversation while you're running. The rule I learned is, if you can't talk you're too fast, if you can sing you're not fast enough.
We don't know whether his initial reaction was "I still care about you but I can't handle the sadness" or "Get the hell out of my sight forever"; I'm guessing, on the evidence, it was closer to the former. It grows out of what their relationship had been like and the circumstances of the cheating, too -- solid marriage, momentary weakness? It happens. And people just handle these things differently.
You always find something in the last place you look.
As /u/chass3 said, north and northwest are your best bets, but everyone else knows it too, so empty spaces are scarce. Also, some neighborhoods have resident-only parking to discourage commuters, so check the signs carefully. Depending on how far away you're coming from, it may be less hassle to park farther away near a bus or shuttle stop and ride in the rest of the way.
Thanks, you too!
H.L. Mencken, 1909:  *Apologies for Love* -- by F.A. Myers. "'Do you remain long in Paris, Miss Wadsworth?' Earl Nero Pensive [!!!] inquired, as he seated himself beside her. His eyes, like beaming lights out of shadowless abysm, were transfixed upon her as if by magic force ..." Thus the story begins. God knows how it ends!
Dead animal, actually.

I've played bridge (the card game) for some time, and this is a factor when bad players play good players, *but* the good players still come out ahead overall, because the luck of the clueless comes into play less often than skill vs. skill. Put another way, a high-variance strategy (essentially, not knowing what to do) may work now and then, but not in the long run.
This is basically why I didn't go into physics; I need to have some sort of physical analogy in my head for these things. (It might have helped if I'd had an explanation like yours way back in high school.) I was pretty good at the math, but the more abstract it all got, the less I wanted to continue.

Just keep telling yourself that if they had a choice they would dress to please you, if it makes you feel better.
Thanks for the information. (They say the best way to find something out isn't to ask but to make a wrong assertion. :-) )

Other good massage oils, besides coconut, are sweet almond oil and (my favorite) grapeseed oil. The expensive massage oils at the store are just something mundane like almond oil with some blend of scents; it's easy to duplicate at home for a fraction of the cost.
