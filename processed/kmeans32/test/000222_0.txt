An upvote to anything that comes from Thoreau. Anyday.
The cover is truly splendid. I will read this book. Thank you so much for sharing it here :))   (This is precisely the purpose of this post: to explore, find and pick up new books inspired by their wondrously designed covers.)
'save' button deserves this post.
A church in shock.
Harry Potter series.
A very good point indeed.
I second you!
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ENJOYING THE POST. I JUST CHECKED YOU OUT AND FOUND OUT THAT YOU HAVEN'T BEEN AROUND REDDIT FOR A LONG WHILE (ATLEAST DIDN'T MAKE ANY POSTS OR COMMENTS) ASSUMING YOU'RE NEW TO [/R/ALLCAPSMOTIVATION](http://www.reddit.com/r/allcapsmotivation/), I WOULD JUST LIKE TO LET YOU KNOW THAT LOWERCASES ARE NOT SOMETHING WE APPRECIATE AROUND THIS SUB.. (I WAS GENTLE WHILE WRITING THAT, ACTUALLY WE FUCKING ABHOR, LOATHE, AND HATE THE GODDAMN LOWERCASE LETTERS WITH ALL OF OUR FUCKING HEARTS.)  AND APPARENTLY YOU'RE AN ASPIRING WRITER (IF I'M NOT WRONG). DO SHARE SOME OF YOUR WORKS HERE IF YOU THINK THEY ARE RELATED TO WHAT THIS SUB STANDS FOR. IF NOT YOU CAN PM ME THE LINKS. I'M AN ASPIRING WRITER TOO SO I WOULD TRY TO READ THEM. ALL THE BEST FOR YOUR WRITING.)  GO KICK-ASS.
Thank you so much for the response :)
That's a very interesting one.. Thank you buddy :)
GET ADDICTED TO DISCOMFORT   GREAT FUCKING THINGS ARE NEVER EASY. THEY SHOULD NOT BE. WHEN WAS THERE A GODDAMN EASY THING THAT YOU FELT BRAINFUCKING PROUD OF YOURSELF JUST BECAUSE YOU DID IT, A THING THAT NOT MANY OUT THERE HAVE DONE TOO?   THERE WONT BE ANY. BECAUSE EASY THINGS ARE FUCKING DONE BY EVERY MOTHERFUCKER OUT THERE. SO WHAT SETS YOU APART FROM THAT HENPECKING CROWD? **DISCOMFORT.**  THAT'S RIGHT. DISCOMFORT IS SEEN BY MANY AS AN UNTOUCHABLE. NOBODY WANTS IT. DISFUCKINGCOMFORT IS AN OUTCAST.. BUT HEY THERE IS SOMETHING WE'RE PHENOMENALLY MISSING TO SEE HERE. DISCOMFORT IS LIKE THE DANGEROUS BRIDGE THAT CAN LAND YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE.. IN FRONT OF THAT CAVE OF TREASURE AND MAGIC THAT YOU'VE ALWAYS FUCKING DESIRED FOR.   OFCOURSE THE PURPOSE IS NOT TO STAY ON THE BRIDGE ITSELF ALL OUR LIVES, BUT TO FUCKING REACH THE OTHER SIDE.. YOU SHOULD NOT LIVE IN DISCOMFORT FOREVER, BUT YOU GOTTA FUCKING USE IT TO MAKE THAT LEAP FORWARD IN YOUR GODDAMN LIFE..   AND THE PROPORTION OF DISCOMFORT THAT CAN REALLY TAKE YOU THE PLACE WHERE YOU WANT TO GO IN LIFE IS OF ASTRONOMICAL PROPORTIONS. YOU DO THAT ONLY THROUGH ADDICTION. GET BITCHLICKING ADDICTED TO DISCOMFORT - TO DO SOMETHING THAT YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE FUCKING DOING, THAT NOBODY FUCKING FEELS LIKE DOING..   THAT, MY BROTHERS, IS THE WAY TO GREAT THINGS...   *WELL WOVEN PATHS CAN NEVER PROVIDE THE ADVENTURE LIKE FORESTS DO..*  **THINK ABOUT IT. DO THE DISCOMFORT.**
Yeah like many comments said.. the idea is good.. but the execution of course matters... And also that human relations thing is true to its core.. I mean, look at **Interstellar** film.. it wouldn't have been what it is if the humanitarian aspects are not embellished into the plot.. look at that Docking Scene.. You want to save a planet full of people, and live for the your loved ones.. else you would just listen to the robot and not try anything, right!
Deep!
Thank you :)
YES I DID... BUT TIME AND AGAIN COMING BACK HERE TO HELP OTHERS BY TELLING WHAT GOOD STUFF YOU'RE DOING IN YOUR LIFE WOULD BE OF A KICK FOR ALL. I'M NOT ASKING YOU WASTE TIME ON THE INTERNET, BUT JUST ASKING TO KEEP THIS MOTIVATING SUB OF OURS ALIVE.. IF YOU THINK THAT IS A TIME WASTE, THEN YES PLEASE GO AHEAD WITH WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING IN REAL LIFE WITHOUT WASTING TIME ON THE INTERNET.   NO HARD FEELINGS, BROTHER!  ALL THE GODDAMN BEST FOR WHATEVER YOU'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE IN YOUR LIFE :)
That's a nice idea... but I'm so keenly attached towards the actual last name, *Dumbledore.*  He is an epitome of all the things from the Harry Potter series that defined my life.
The idea of your book is really interesting to me... Especailly the prot realizing that he doesn't know anything.. Greetings for coming up with something like that .. And all the very best for it get good publishers.. and when it happens do plz message me a link where I can buy it.. Amazon probably.. I'm from India. I would like to read your book, pal, assuming that it's not very very long ;-)   Thanks :)
so you feel less guilty about being a smug brick  TIL that I'm a smug brick. Thanks :)  Apart from that, I said 'we' because a lot of our comments are misinterpreted. So, I just said that onbehalf of all those people.. But you are misinterpreting that too. How ironic!
Good work, bro! Let me upvote you now :)
Oh, brother, you just inferred a lot of brilliant but unnecessary shit which the quote doesn't even seem to imply.. I'm sorry that it hurt your feelings.. What you said about those countries and cultures might be true, I don't know.. That quote doesn't even in the least bit tell anything about non-readers.. I just posted this quote solely because it appeals to book readers.. I would do the same even if that quote came from goddamn Bermuda Triangle!
I'm 24 now.. I was free much of 2013 and I'd read 36 books that year. That's higher than the total number of books I read in the prior 23 years put together.. and now in 2014 I had my first job and finished 25 books by yesterday.   I know they're not great numbers compared to what people here usaually hold.. But still, I did fine for where I came from..  I'm a non-native in English, (from India), so I slowly picked up the habit of reading books, and now they're an integral part of my life. Books mean a lot to me. My dream is to become an English language novelist. So, I look forward to develop my reading habits and abilities to a great extent in the future.  The list of the 25 books that I've finished in 2014 are:  * *The Great Gatsby* by F. Scott Fitzgerald  * *The Man Who Japed* by Philip K Dick   * *The Accidental Billionaires* by Ben Mezrich  * *Tuesdays with Morrie* by Mitch Albom  * *Siddhartha* by Herman Hesse  * *The Doomsday Conspiracy* by Sidney Sheldon  * *The Illusions* by Richard Bach  * *The Flipside* by Adam J Jackson * *Animal Farm* by George Orwell * *Saving Faith* by David Baldacci  * *The Loser* by Peter Ustinov  * *The Undercover Economist* by Tim Harford  * *The Tipping Point* by Malcolm Gladwell  * *Screw It, Lets Do It* by Richard Branson  * *Flatland* by Edwin A. Abbott  * *1984* by George Orwell  * *Prey* by Michael Crichton  * *The Giver* by Lois Lowry  * *Out of My Head* ( also published as *Unknown*) by Didier Van Cauwelaert  * *Next* by Michael Lewis  * *Gone Girl* by Gillian Flynn  * *The Old Man And The Sea* by Ernest Hemingway * *The Rubiyat* by Omar Khayyam  * *Of Mice And Men* by John Steinbeck  * *Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde* by R. L. Stevenson    and also an essay called *Walking* by Henry David Thoreau  Thank you r/books, for being such an awesome sub and for putting lots and lots of new books into my life.. You guys rock :)
This is SOMETHING!
BATMAN.
First of all, I was expecting great story from the book because of all the hype of it being a classic and all.... and most importantly due to the depressive environment the entire book had bestowed upon me (I must say, in this case the author succeeded in making me feel the Dystopian time completely.. Orwell did great work at that)... So, I guess, I disliked the book mostly because I was expecting lot of great thrilling story from it rather than focusing on the classic idea of privacy invasion.. so that's the reason. My bad.
"Anything with the power to make you laugh over thirty years later isnt a waste of time. I think something like that is very close to immortality."  That's another Stephen King right there... from *Hearts In Atlantis*
Hey thanks for pointing out the things that made this piece unimpresseive to you.. Yes in this piece rather than a full story or a conflict. I just tried to write about some mystic encounters of a person with a light that he saw in his dreams which mysteriously tranformed him and made him get better at things that were bothering him. It's like a magical medicine that he doesn't know where it was coming from.  I will keep your review in mind and shall practice on with the aspects you mentioned.  Thank you so much, Kalteras :) :)
I like the flash fiction pieces that emphasize more on *single-scene* settings rather than long *short-stories*. It gives more chance to take the reader into a part of the story, like waking up to a moment into the dream.. You never remember all of the dream, only few vague portions of it. [Flash Fiction, according to me should be like that, or at least *that's my style*.]  Your work is good. The descriptions were easy enough to paint a good visual picture to the reader. Keep it at that level, it's good. Now, on the other side of the things, the writing from the point where a gun was pointed at the back of his head to the moment the stranger entered the last digit into the safe.. things didn't seem much clear. It felt like what you wanted to say wasn't properly delivered. In short, that part was unclear.   Over all.. Good work 7/10.   All the best for the next one :)
thank you very much for the answers.. :)
Hey thank you so much for the feedback.. It is very helpful and surely didn't hurt a bit, because my main focus, as far as my "Writing" life is concerned, is not on poetry, it's basically on *fiction.* This poetry pieces are just a trail to drench my thirst, just to see if I can writing nice sounding and rhyming stuff. That's all. Apparently, I couldn't.  Anyways, talking of poetry, let me confess, I tried reading epic poetry like *Paradise Lost*, but truth be told, I never *understand* anything in those epic poetic lines, but then sometimes among them I used to find some really awesome powerful *quotes* kind-of lines, which made me keep going if only for searching more of such lines..   Why I'm telling you all this is because you really seem to have great knowledge on poetry related works (you even mentioned that your academics are related to this field). So I want to ask you for help.   Please help me with an explanation on how to read epic poetry?? I mean, I literally Googled for a verse/prose translation of Paradise Lost. *How freaking weird is that* - to search for the English prose translation for a work already originally written in English itself! I mean, come on, what kind of idiot does such a thing.. I did it. Because I was unable to figure out even a single sentence clearly..   Now, tell me what am I supposed to do about all this?? I really want to read great epic poetry, like Paradise Lost, Divine Comedy, The Aeneid, Beowulf and etc..!! HELP.  **Note**: English is not my first language, I'm from India.
How do you people like 'Gitanjali' by Ravindranath Tagore??   A couple of years ago, I was introduced to the real beauty of words through *Gitanjali* by Tagore. (And that day I understood what kind of Literary art forms are awarded Nobels in Literature)  Have you people read that book..? If so, how you liked it??
Awesome!! JUst outstanding...
Funny.. but makes sense!
