They've been easy since 13, nearly impossible to miss this game and they weren't bad on 12 for me
I always would've loved to see him on the squad, but we are simply too stacked at his positions.
Defensive help   So I consider myself a solid fifa player. I'm d2 in seasons and d4 in ultimate team, but the one thing I struggle with the most is when players can just sprint right by my defense. I can't seem to stop that. I've tried being more patient on defense and playing less pressure but I can't get it to work. Any tips are appreciated! Thank you
Norwich, CT!
I'm new to ultimate team and I'm working on a Bundesliga team. I'm having difficulty filling out the open positions and I don't want to have to spend too much on them. Right now I have Messi on for 3 more games at striker. I have Bas dost in my squad, but is he any good?
Advice on my squad?
Those are nice too!

I am loving A-Rod more than I have ever. That man is a still a beast. It was a blessing in disguise having him gone last year
Best 2k game?   So I currently have MLB2k10 and playing franchise upsets me because I'll notice the league leaders in ERA will have an era over 3.50 and only a few guys will be under 4.00.  I'm really just trying to figure out if there's a mlb2k game out there that doesn't have these issues

Really?   So I'm stuck to sleep over at someone's house tonight. Was stuck last night too. Had to sleep on the floor. So my roommate and I were leaving work and he was driving, he didn't say anything about us going to his friend's house again. I was planning on taking a nice shower and making some BBQ chicken for dinner. So now I haven't eaten in several hours, I feel gross and Im exhausted. I also get to look forward to sleeping on the floor again tonight and possibly not eating until the morning. Also going to work in the same clothes, unshowered, teeth unbrushed and phone dead. I would've love to have at least been told that this would be happening tonight. I mean what the hell bro.
It's hard to tell what's tongue in cheek on the internet lol. Yeah that was bad. Hacking the stock market if possible would be damaging to the economy as well. Also one persons voice can unite millions. If there was someone with the goal of terrorizing become popular and then using those people to act out terror then that would be bad too.
There are 31 total tracks. It has muffin top, Tracy's short version of I will always love you, werewolf bar mitzvah, tennis night in America, Jenna's America song, midnight train to Georgia, the long play of the 30 rock theme, jenna and Danny's Christmas song, the other Christmas song where Colleen and Jack finish it. There are a bunch of smaller jingles in it too.
Yes! Honestly this scene makes me so happy and almost emotional whenever I see it. It really shows how everyone in the show really is connected and loves each other in some way.
[Request] I want some celebratory pizza   So after struggling for 3 months because I missed a good amount of work I'm finally caught up on my bills. I would have some money left, but in all of my excitement I got some Christmas gifts for my nephews and I've got just enough to keep myself going until I get paid again. I'm super happy, but also hungry. I would love a celebratory pizza. All I've had to eat the past 2 weeks is pasta and sauce (it's so cheap) and while I still love it, I love pizza more. I live about 10 minutes from a dominos if anyone would like to buy me a pizza. Thank you.
Stay away from Sanchez. Have trust in Russ. The giants don't have a good secondary. Wilson should be able to expose it.

I was 16, a couple months from turning 17. My mom, sister, her two kids and myself were going to be evicted. I was going to have to move to a new town and start going to a new high school. It was really scary for me. Then a friend's mom and dad offered to let me live with them so I could still go to the same high school. My mom urges me to do what I thought was best for myself so I went and stayed with that friend's family. I lived their for a year and a half and I've never been more grateful for something.
I would go with Matt Ryan. You've got a beautiful QB situation here though. Can't really go wrong, but I like Matt Ryan more because he's go better targets around him and Cinci seems to give up a lot of yards.
Standard espn scoring: Marques Colston vs Cleveland, Julian Edelman vs Minnesota, victor Cruz vs Arizona, desean Jackson vs Jacksonville, Emanuel sanders vs KC,Alshon Jeffries vs San Fran. Pick 2
Girl I know recently broke up with her boyfriend   So this girl I've had a crush on for a whole now recently broke up with her boyfriend about two weeks ago. I've hung out with her a few times since and I'm really getting interested in her. I'm 20 and I'm really awkward when it comes to these situations so I'm not sure how to handle it. I definitely want her to know I'm interested and I've tried to by giving her compliments (not too many), but I really don't want to come on too strong since I've heard her say to her friends she doesn't want to rush into a relationship. I know she doesn't think I'm bad looking and at least as good looking as her ex and we get along great. Ask any questions you all need, I'm appreciative of any help I can get.

Ebola Zaire which isn't responsible for this outbreak kills 90%. This one is 60-70% which is still nasty. A lot of people are freaking out because of how fast it is spreading for an ebola outbreak and how long it is lasting. People jump to ill-advised conclusions that it might be airborne now, but it's surely not. The outbreak would be larger than it is now. This outbreak is spreading at this rate and for this long because it isn't killing that quickly for an ebola strain so more people can come into contact with an infected person. No need to panic if you're in a wealthy country or outside of Africa.
As someone moving to brookyln soon I'm glad I saw this thread. I would think walking around looking bummy would work. That was going to be my strategy until I got more accustomed to the city.
Relax, you're making pranks out to be some kind of existential crisis. I mean, I follow "live every week like it's shark week" as much as the next guy, but sometimes we need to let the sharks go by.
Sounds good, I'll take care of it. Thank you!
