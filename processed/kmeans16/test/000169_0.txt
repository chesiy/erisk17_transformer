"Jim, I want to talk about masturbation. Now, I just want you to know that it's-it's a perfectly normal, uh, thing. And I have to admit, uh, you know. I did a fair bit of masturbating when I was a little younger. I, uh -- I used to call it "stroking the salami." Yeah, you know, "pounding the ol' pud." I never did it with baked goods. But you know your Uncle Mort? He "pinched the one-eyed snake" five, six times a day. See, it's like, uh, practice for the big game. You see? It's like -- It's like...hitting a tennis ball against a brick wall. Which can be fun. It can be fun, but it's not a game."  "Right. No. It's not a game."  "What you want is you want a partner to return the ball. Do you want a partner?"  "Yeah. Yeah-Yeah, I want a partner."  "You do want a partner?"  "Oh, I want a partner."  "Want a partner. Good. Good."  "Of course."  "Good."

The author barely even mentions anything political in the piece. All he does is list his new book at the bottom that he's plugging that goes something along the lines of "Beating back right wingers." This is definitely one of the worst posts I've even seen in this sub and that's saying something.
