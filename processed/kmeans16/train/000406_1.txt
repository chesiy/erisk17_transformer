This sounds lame but its actually awesome: How does magic work?  In the film industry, we have to know exactly how to make people swallow things they know aren't true. How does time travel work? The flux capacitor. Nobody asks how the flux capacitor works. But bring up "unobtainium" which is essentially the same story MacGuffin and everybody cries foul.   It's super interesting to see what bullshit phlebotinum people will accept, and what people have so much trouble believing. For example, I'm working on a pilot about lawyers, and at great expense I had a civil tort attorney fact check the script. But audiences weren't buying...the truth.
The DMV uses the income from registration to offset the expenditures of building new roads. If you gave registration power to a company, the physical process might move quicker, but you are guaranteed less roads. In fact, what would be the incentive to pay for any roads at all unless you could charge people in real time for every drive on every road? Are some roads of social value that cannot be determined by the market? Does this not necessarily give monopoly power to one company every time you want to drive home from work?

I can only give my own experiences/insights into depression, and they may or may not apply to the broader population.  I find the argument that because we haven't cured something, then we aren't going to is unconvincing. Neurobiology is an exploding field right now. Check out the new research into [TMS therapy](http://neurostar.com/neurostar-tms-depression-treatment/).  But that wasn't really one of the two cases involved so let's get into those.  Strong case:   Yes, you are absolutely correct: getting depressed people to function normally despite feeling terrible is not a cure at all. But that doesn't mean we have to give up there. Just because a bunch of doctors don't understand what a real cure would look like doesn't mean that we should give up looking for a cure.  Weak case:   Yes, people vary. And yes, it takes a long time to cure. But this argument only works within the framework that x ailment can be assuaged with y pill. When it comes to depression, y is less like a pill and more like a bunch of overarching techniques like mindfulness, therapy, mental illness education, familial/friend support, and, yes, chemical medication.

I, too, applaud you for rational discourse.  But I will argue against you on a few points. This woman is using the points made by a few stupid people to argue against completely unrelated ideas. Should the fact that feminazis exist preclude the argument that there is a broader legal battle over a woman's right to choose her own surgeries? That would be like saying that because misogyny exists we should disregard addressing men-dying-in-the-workplace issues.  You are totally right: men dying in the workplace is a gendered issue that deserves an immediate, organized response. Let me be the feminist that agrees with you that women have it nice in a lot of ways. Why must a feminist organization also be a men's rights organization? Simply because both causes are right does not mean all political movements must address them simultaneously. The NAACP is a generally good organization that supports good causes. Its contemporary, the AARP, is a generally good organization that supports good causes. Both movements exists to actuate different political agendas even though they stem from the same philosophy: equality under the law.  Not that I support your ousting of the FMLA. It would benefit the feminist image greatly if we could make public gestures of good faith toward men, rather than creating political enemies at the expense of our most important agendas: equality under the law and a major cultural attitude shift toward women.  But to your point that feminism encourages feminazis: I must vehemently disagree. Feminist organizations might attract feminazis, but do they create them? Do men's rights groups necessarily create misognynists?  As a man who recently suffered a major, life-changing electrical workplace accident while working in lighting and grip on set, I know we have some common ground: equality, legal fairness, justice. Perhaps instead of trying to change each other's respective movements, we can simply both join each other's proverbial NAACP and AARP.   OP is not on your side; instead, she is against us both. OP's anti-feminist rationale can be turned into anti-men's rights rhetoric. "Pro-women" does not have to mean "demonize men," in the same way that "pro-men" does not have to demonize women. I am "an adult who is capable of taking responsibility for my own actions." That does not mean I don't need people like you to fight for my rights in the workplace.   We have a common enemy: ignorance, and though we might disagree on the best way to combat it, let's not be seduced by hate or buy into the rhetoric that we must be diametrically opposed.

I'm saying that innocent executions could hypothetically be a result of the ruling that innocence does not qualify one for habeas relief, not that Pinholster was innocent.  Also, remember we're not talking about the appeal itself, but the right to even have the appeal heard, so by definition it relates to evidence that a jury and judge could not have heard. And remember that in the original case it was a question of ineffective assistance of counsel in the first place!  Think deeper than just the opinion. What is it like for somebody who actually has been convicted of murder? You're correct that newly-discovered evidence could be filed for post conviction relief, but who files? In the case of Pinholster, it was a brain-damaged crazy guy with no right to counsel. How was he supposed to file for relief on his own during the statute of limitations? Think about what this says. Yes, we see that you have evidence that could prove you innocent, but you were too crazy/legally illiterate to file it without a lawyer in time. Now that you have a lawyer, it's too late and you have to die. So what does this ultimately mean? Does the constitutionally mandated right to relief against unlawful imprisonment cover innocence? The Supreme Court says no.
