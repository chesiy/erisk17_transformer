I'm not saying it tastes bad but when you have commercials on TV I think you're no longer a craft beer
I mean he was actually successful until he decided to just cut into the guy
Just like anything it just takes some "practice" and getting used to.  Next time you're out try talking to a stranger about anything, ask them how their day is going. People are surprisingly nice. Or make it easier on yourself and go to the bar, order a beer and talk to the person next to you. Then work your way up from there, and don't be afraid to speak your mind
Breakfast- I'm with the other guy, none  Lunch-Taqueria Chaparrito  Dinner-Sellas for a calzone  Bar-The Coug although I've been going to My Office alot lately  Dessert-Ferdinands, of course
I know it's already been said but this was freakin awesome! You did an amazing job editing that with the video and sounds and the order of it. I'm crying right now
Right? I've watched How i Met your mother since I was 19 and when I turned 21 I was pretty disappointed to find out that bars are super crowded, noisy to the point you cant hear anyone, and there's never a girl just sitting there waiting to be hit on
First saw her in the hallway of my gen Bio class and thought she was cute. A month later she was at my apt because she ended up bein a friend of a friend. Skip ahead like 5 months and I invited her to  a party I was having out of the blue and she came. We dated for 8 months after that
I kinda think this is really dumb. For one he's 20 years older, he's wearing a hat and sunglasses, and they wouldn't be expecting him to just be there

Figure out how you study best. I came in Freshman year thinking it would be enough to look over the study guide a couple times and be solid. Did NOT work out. You'll score a lot higher if you know how to study well  Also study a little bit every day instead of cramming, if you do this you'll have all the time in the world to go out and have fun
Easily one of the best episodes, not only because the acting is great but every character is engaged.  Ted wearing Tweed and becoming the sexless inkeeper and Barney's hilarious poem. Then Marshal with the gouda and Jason Segel's great singing video montage (meow). Then Barney and Robin being a "single" couple. "Just the 2 of you?" Lily getting upset with Marshal for springing the video and then getting in trouble for inviting the other couple for a weekend away too soon. And finally Ted'd own poem and Barney's look of regret at the end for being in a relationship " What have I done!"
You just sit on them and glide around the gym and of course smash into anyone in your path. Of course it ended in one of 2 ways: Your fingers going under the wheel or the thing tipping over also crushing your fingers.
As much as I dislike the same questions getting asked the top comments are almost always a different story so it still keeps it interesting/funny. I laugh way harder at these comments then I do on /r/funny
This stuff is all over Washington, you see it all the time here. Oregon too I'm sure
Plus the timeline seems all screwed up. I watched Death Note in like 36 hours and I couldn't believe the plot of the sho was over the span of like 6 years
Well the lack of anything substantial in this picture would suggest /r/pics, and the content would suggest /r/mildlyinfuriating, but since this is so incredibly not funny it's gotta be /r/funny
