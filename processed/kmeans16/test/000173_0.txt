Naziism was a socialist political movement. The Nazis, AKA the National Socialist German Workers Party, believed in government control over the means of production and distribution and a government centric society at the expense of individual liberty. Hitler was a devout socialist leader and writer. He felt that standard socialism was too slow and he  felt Naziism offered a better socialist path. He disliked communists because he felt they were too internationally focused and that they contained too many Jewish members.   Hitler was a true socialist as was Mussolini. They were certainly not Communists. Socialism works on paper but always fails in real life. The reason? Because ultimately, the government (acting in proxy for the community) must use force to compel the people to comply. It is at that point that all socialist societies resort to violence to force the people to obey.   The US has killed many during its history and yes some of those people have been innocents. But you simply can't compare what the US has done in its history with what socialist regimes have done in their histories. The US have killed mostly combatants that were actively trying to kill Americans. Did Pol Pot do the same? Mao? Hitler? Stalin? Tito? Ceauescu?  No, the difference is that those regimes used violence to compel civilians to obey. They used murder, starvation, secret police, active campaigns to force compliance to official policy.
The climate systems, ocean systems, solar activity, and all other factors that effect Earth's climate are very complex.   The fact that all models predicting temperature rises have been woefully wrong compared to actual data proves this.    http://www.drroyspencer.com/2013/06/still-epic-fail-73-climate-models-vs-measurements-running-5-year-means/  The 97% of scientists agree that anthropogenic climate change is occurring claim has been thoroughly debunked.    http://www.thegwpf.org/new-paper-the-97-consensus-and-its-critics/  http://www.thegwpf.org/content/uploads/2014/09/Warming-consensus-and-it-critics1.pdf  The 97% claim is based on a study by John Cook. His emails on the study are revealing:   "Its essential that the public understands that theres a scientific consensus on AGW. So [Skeptical Science activists] Jim Powell, Dana [Nucitelli] and I have been working on something over the last few months that we hope will have a game changing impact on the public perception of consensus. Basically, we hope to establish that not only is there a consensus, there is a strengthening consensus." -John Cook  Two things are immediately apparent from this email.   1. Cook had decided even before he began his investigations what those investigations would reveal.   2. This was always going to be a PR exercise, not a scientific one.  Cook's own emails further destroy any credibility in the 97% figure be showing his intentionally misleading methodology:  "Okay, so weve ruled out a definition of AGW being any amount of human influence or more than 50 percent human influence. Were basically going with Aris porno approach (I probably should stop calling it that) which is AGW = humans are causing global warming. e.g.  no specific quantification which is the only way we can do it considering the breadth of papers were surveying." -John Cook  But Cooks 97 percent consensus claim was rebutted in subsequent analyses of his study. A paper by five leading climatologists published in the journal Science and Education last year found that Cooks study misrepresented the views of most consensus scientists.  The definition Cook used to get his consensus was weak, the climatologists said. Only 41 out of the 11,944 published climate studies examined by Cook explicitly stated that mankind caused most of the warming since 1950 meaning the actual consensus is 0.3 percent.   This graph proves there has indeed been a pause in global temperatures for 18 years and running:  http://www.climatedepot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/1711years.png  The data for the graph above is from RSS satellite.  You said:  There is no ideal temperature for Earth  there is no constant to provide as an answer, CO2 levels are always changing  So how do we know that the current (or future)  temp and CO2 levels are bad? Doesn't that defeat your entire premise?

I bet you are also an MMA cage fighter, Special Forces trainer (possibly a Navy SEAL) and all the ladies love you.   No, it is obvious you are uneducated past a high school level and you are incurious of the world around you and are simply a follower. I am not criticizing you, I know I appreciate people like you when my car needs to be waxed or I need someone to serve tasty snacks at parties.   The bottom line is that I CHALLENGED YOU to provide proof and you simply could not do so. You failed plain and simple.  You proved that I was smarter than you and I appreciate the compliment.
Shooting anyone, even if totally justified, will change your life. I personally go to great lengths to avoid drawing on someone even if it is legally justified.   Carrying a firearm is a great responsibility. Slights, insults, and other infractions by others can be ignored because you are carrying and those insults are thus not real challenges to your honor or manhood.   I was not there so I am not trying to criticize. I just know that drawing on someone or shooting them, even if 100% justified, will open up a Costco sized can of worms that will likely not be pleasant for everyone involved.

Socialism is a political and economic system characterized by having a planned economy, where the government controls the means of production in a government centric society at the expense of individual goals and freedom.  Fascism (and Naziism) were both forms of socialism. Not in just name but in goals and in practice. I strongly suggest you attend some college courses before you continue to discuss political science.
This being reddit, I am surprised no one has made a snarky response such as "It is your wife. Pic taken at Motel 6 down by the interstate"
It's not Ad hominem because it is not simply a meaningless attack of Warren for being a bitch. It is a criticism of a necessary requirement for leadership. I demand all leaders be trustworthy and not place their goals ahead of the people's needs.   Warren has a documented history of lying. Even her husband lied about being a Native American too.   Please look at this chart:  http://i.imgur.com/qqhr4dK.jpg?1  This is the relative Warren claimed made her Native American. As you can see her claim is a total fabrication.
You are 100% wrong. The only portion of the middle class that the New Deal created was from hiring government bureaucracy employees.  May I suggest you read a book on US History? Your knowledge on the subject is based on Liberal ideology and not historical fact.
These miniature helicopters are tiny, being 10x2.5 cm (4x1 inch) aircraft that are battery powered, very quiet and can stay in the air for 20 minutes per sortie. The rotor diameter is 12 cm (4.8 inches). The UAV is made of hard plastic and one can be ready for action in less than a minute. A complete set (two UAVs and the controller) weighs less than a kilogram (2.2 pounds). The operator can see (and capture) video and still photos on the hand held controller as the operator sends the PD-100 up to a kilometer away. The operator can zoom the camera. The PD-100 also carries GPS, a thermometer, compass and altitude sensor. Max speed is 10 meters a second (36 kilometers/22.5 miles an hour) and max altitude is about 500 meters.

You have failed to refute my points. Nice interpretation of American Values. Lol  Why would the Republicans embrace ANY policy that would:  1. Attract a tiny minority of voters (Voters for whom racism is at the very top of their requirements in a candidate)  2. Anger and offend the vast majority of the voting public?  It makes no logical sense to do so. Can you imagine a party adopting a policy of "We are the party of pedophiles"?  The Left has lied about Republicans and their alleged embrace of racism.  Without lies the Left has nothing
