Total bitch made bro. It must be scary to live in a world where the only viable response to a differing opinion is a silent, yet visible dismissal or "that's bitchmade".   Keep it trill, /r/NBA.
If Mufasah was such a great king, he wouldn't have allowed himself to be killed. And this is the animal kingdom we're talking about, where males constantly challenge each other for dominion of territory. Mufasah  Scar  Simba.
Sorry. I'll be more tactful.  At a gas station buy water, mineral water or unsweet tea for a drink and almonds or peanuts or jerky (careful as some have a lot of added sugar but it's easy to find some with minimal - which isn't a bad thing) as a snack.  You're right, it's not easy but it is simple. You just have to adjust the way you approach purchasing food. I was in the same boat and felt the same way you do, but with a little bit of foresight and willpower, it's easy to not consume heavily processed junk food. Buy fruits at the grocery store, take them with you. Buy frozen fruit (i prefer raspberries which are very low in sugar and blueberries) and [edemame](http://www.seapointfarms.com/new_products_pages/lightly-salted.html) for quick and easy snacks that are high in fiber, protein and vitamins.  Drink hot tea or black coffee. Buy chicken breast (bags of frozen chicken breasts are cheap, healthy and easy to work with). Buy seasonal vegetables. Canned tuna is extremely healthy, make a tuna salad with 0% greek yogurt, celery, and whatever else you like in it. If you have to have bread/pastas buy whole wheat with the least amount of sugars (though those carbs are broken down to sugar so even 'sugar free' bread technically has sugars).  Get a crock pot, make stews with lots of vegetables and some meat. Lentils, quinoa, black beans are great sources of fiber and protein, are cheap and are filling.  You'll find it gets easier and easier to adjust your eating and buying habits the further along you go. I consume very little food which has added sugar and it just takes a little bit of self control to get there.  Good luck and sorry if I was an asshole earlier, just trying to help out.  Lost about 80 pounds the past 18 months by adjusting my habits. Cutting out that (excess) sugar is so worth it and I hope you manage to make it a reality.
Terry had a great game.
I'm not even talking about stats; Parsons had 29 last night. I'm talking about cohesion, chemistry and their complimentary skill sets. This year's team hums like a machine whereas last year's squad seemed to step on each other's toes frequently which would grind the train to a stop. Harden/Lin/Parsons all had similar offensive repoitoires which would create knots in the offense. Now Harden has free reign of the mid range, and shooters on the wings. You know, in theory.
Though you're being sarcastic, I am truthfully a kind person. I might falter occasionally but it's something I believe is a very simple way to positively influence your immediate surroundings.    Any who, he's not the subject, focus or punch line; the morning box of chocolate ice cream is. And my first thought was, "what's that dude eating", followed by "can't be ice cream", followed by "wow it is ice cream", followed by "I should take a picture", followed by "I want some now".
Well, it says that exact thing on the song page, so there really isn't much to argue about.  To commence - one of the oldest and rarest tracks from an at the cutting edge of sound - Flume.  from the link.
Oh. Darn.
ok
I've been on reddit for almost 4 years and I think your comment is like the 5th I've upvoted, so kudos on that.
Yeah when I was talking about vicinity to the light rail I meant Midtown. I do walk from the rail to my apt in montrose (Westheimer and Montrose abouts) every day after work and I don't think it's far (though it's starting to turn into a sweaty walk). I walk wayyyyy more than the average Houstonian to be fair.  There are a few bus routes that will take you there a lot quicker but I prefer the walk after work; gets my blood pumping a little.
Come off it man, I was just joking.
Which is fair, but I did admit that his time in LA was an unmitigated disaster.   Dude is busting post moves during the playoffs I didn't even know he had when he was playing for LA.  That's because he didn't have them then. He's been working very closely with Hakeem pretty much since he arrived in Houston and you can definitely see Dream's influence on Howard's post moves. Another sign of his dedication to improvement and his game.
that comes with love and hate.  i disagree. i don't see any reason or benefit to bringing hate into the equation. sure i'll be disappointed if we lose, and i'll be disappointed if harden doesn't play well or howard looks like he's playing lazy or lin does something stupid...but it's just basketball and that disappointment wont last longer than 5 minutes. I love the rockets but i'm never gonna turn that into anything other than joy. if they lose they lose and i go home and i go to sleep and i wake up the next day in the exact same situation as if they'd won.  C'est la vie
No offense but I'm sure the people who are working on this are a tad bit more knowledgeable than you.  Yeah, obviously there are hurtles, if there weren't any it would be imminent and not 10 years down the road (projected). You people always pop up, "well... established knowledge dictates that this is impossible, therefore any advancement is not possible." Or maybe you're not one of those.
Two dozen other countries that still are dwarfed by the military capabilities of the United States. Good luck getting across the Atlantic with the rest of NATO's airforce and navy.
