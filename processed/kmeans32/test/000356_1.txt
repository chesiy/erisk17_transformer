Holy shit
I really admire him, and I wish I was more like him. I can relate to everything he's saying. 'Fuck em' too right !
well i've just finished a short that took about 2months ish including development and research
heres a link to it, I'm a little dumb so i dont know an easier way of linking it but here it is  https://benosullivanwritesstuff.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/sex-addict-project-draft-3-2.pdf
i think it was an attempt to talk about an issue or is RDJ the only one allowed to talk about drug problems ? he's allowed to use it for positive 'i've turned it around publicity' but when its used for an agenda relating to a wider issue its not allowed, well since he's heard it a million times before maybe he should learn to act with a sense of dignity and decorum rather than confirming the primadona steroytype. I understand he gets personal questions a lot and it must be frustrating but it makes it worse if he gets it a lot and he acts this childish, have a sense of a workplace ethic, pretty embarrassing on RDJs part.   What a joke.
why ? i'll be brave enough to do it then
i hate to keep bothering the good people of this subreddit.   I'm hoping to get drunk enough so i have the guts to follow through this time  i appreciate everyones help, i won't forget it anyway i've got a thing to do
thanks and sorry.   Hey everyone although i've made some enemies here and i've generally said stupid things at times, i really wanted to say thanks before i did it. anyway love this subbreddit and love everyone on here, you're all really friendly and easy to get along with and talk too, couldn't praise the subreddit any higher, anyway i don't have anyone else to thank or to say nice things too, due to this black hole I'm in and due to the nature of the illness its getting tougher and tougher, but thats neither here nor there, don't worry about my shit, i just wanted to say thanks so much for making this subbreddit awesome and thanks for putting up with me, cya   xx
thanks mate your right !
well i've had a few girlfriends and a load of shitty one night stands but this girl was the only one i really cared about. its gonna be very tough getting over her, feeling like I'm in a blackhole right now and i don't know how I'm gonna get out. but I'm sure in time i'll feel better. plus she's in my circle of close friends so I'm gonna have to see her everyday. but everyone on here has helped a lot :). thanks for caring   think i misread your comment. sorry haha

really ? haha i guess that sums up me in one sentence goofy but cute haha !
firstly i love cheesy comedy one of the reasons i love pierce brosnan as bond was because of the lines e.g i thought christmas only comes once a year. but i just like kevin bacon and stupid cheesy crap jokes
the worst is when you go to the reduced section for a cheeky gander and you spot a dented can and you think ' Sick its gonna be like 20p or something' and its still 95p ARE YOU KIDDING ME TESCO
Yeah i hear you mate i just wanted to let people know because I'm really excited plus my first post here. but i plan on working on it all summer !

i don't need to justify myself to some over-opinionated asshole. I'm up for a discussion and debate but like this subreddit its not possible without running into know it all wankers like you.  you are a cunt mate and most of your posts have downvotes so most people must think the same. peace

yep completely agree
Mate thats quite a story keep me informed !
its going better on my arsenal save. i stormed the league in my first season and won the champions league (probably my proudest achievement) beating man united in the semis. however my second season was disaster made some wrong moves in the transfer window and ended up finishing 9th  i got to the semis of the champions league the league cup and the fa cup all knocked out by man united ( I'm glad the old rivalry is back though)  i somehow managed to keep my job and most of my important players. now I'm in my third season and I'm two points of top but I'm just targeting a top 4 finish.i have also had a lot of fun bringing my youth through dan crowley serge gnabry and a few others are now semi regulars. but yeah thats it at the moment
Fairplay Freiburg !
thats true not disupting that but the question isn't what character is a badass. its a shark sharks need to eat leave the poor bastard alone
Help please   hey guys i have not had any problems with fm at all regarding running the game. but suddenly a few days ago i load up my save and it is horrendously slow takes ages when i change anything on the tactics screen takes ages to advance forward and to play games. generally really slow and it lagging a lot. i have no issue with memory on my laptop and i have never had a problem like this before and i don't really know what i can do. any help would be appreciated  p.s i have england as a playable league and all the other leagues as view only.
thats awsome ! in one save i won the title 11 times in 13 years with a two and a half star right winger he  was a very important cog in my team
Thanks mate the football manager community are really supportive its awesome !

thanks for the advice and the help means a lot thanks again :)
