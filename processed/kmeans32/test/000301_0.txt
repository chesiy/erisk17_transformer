My buddy said you should watch the documentary called unhung hero.. It's about a guy with a small penis who gets dumped by his gf for having a small penis and then travels the country to see if his penis really is too small... I want to watch it now!
I was about 90% sure I was going to die that night. He could have done it so easily and my co worker didn't give him all the money (although the robber didn't know that) bt if he did that would have been all the reason he needed to do me in. When I think back about it, there are so many things I wish I would have done, but in the moment there was no chance I would have actually done it. But it is interesting to look at the situation from a few different ways in my head. I will have to check out that book tho, sounds interesting to me, especially now
And shit
This is fucking stupid... I smell complete bullshit..  "Defying everything that once stood in our way" Bahahahaha just fuck either already!
Yes, yes I do
So first of faggot, he has been going to that lady for over 35 years.. Secondly, if barbershops weren't full of pretentious douche bags like yourself, maybe I would have considered it.
Thanks so much!!
It's my grandfathers 90th today and I have an old photo from WWII of him and I would not do it justice on Photoshop, so I figured I would put it here. Anything is so much appreciated by my family!
Meet Pepper
These fucking chicks... Awful just awful..
It is in north Lake Tahoe just west of Truckee CA on top of Donner Summit
I recently started taking photos and this is the first photo I am actually proud of.
Found this in the free section of Craigslist...I hope its a joke but moreover I hope no one picks it up...
there is a post rock band called Thieves of the American Dream who do all instrumental music..very cinematic pieces, its been used in documentaries and commercials.. [thieves of the american dream](http://www.reverbnation.com/thievesoftheamericandream)
Hahaha rad man! I am a rock musician too bt do hip hop stuff on the side so I appreciate where you are coming from and putting this out there! You sound a bit like [MC Paul Barman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MC_Paul_Barman) and [Atmosphere](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_(music_group) the lyrics are good with a good sense of timing about them. Te beat is pretty good too just needs to have the drums drop in a little harder! I'd love to put some drums to this track! Nicely done, hope to hear more!
this is nothing new..
Found this while walking on some trails by my house. I think it is an old coin, but I am not sure..anyone have any ideas?
beth?
Hahaha ur right bro. What was I thinking...And learning on white wash u are right, Im so in your way and complete nuisance. It's all good, i don't set foot in PB, so you can claim that for yourself..I'll take a break at wind n sea, table tops, boneyards, hell even beacons or any other break in NC over PB any day so that's all yours man..  If your worried about a "kook" stealing ur wave, don't trip. I have lived here my whole life and have been in the water for most of it just not surfing, so I know my etiquette. But I will say out of everyone I've talked to about this learning experience, you sir have been the biggest Richard of them all, so I say good day to you
Hahaha thanks, someone at the bar the other night made the same comment and I had to google it to see bc I couldnt remember..good call tho
Back story?
living in San Diego and being a padres fan and trying to get a job with them myself, this is awesome and I hope she finds work!
how does one get laid with a bathroom like that because you and I know that after sex, she is going to use the bathroom..
thats why you always gotta have your other shit to keep you sane, trust me if I just had this job, id kill myself bc overnights suck balls. But I know that this is just a paycheck for me and the real fun happens once I get off! its all a matter of tolerance
