Congrats, detective.
Honestly it's more like crapware. Sometimes I have fun infecting my VM with stuff from malc0de, MDL, etc, and more than a couple times this 360 Internet Security kept getting installed (maybe it was in a PUP installer?). Then it started detecting other malware in the VM (lol), and I had to uninstall it, which was hard, as the uninstaller was in Chinese, so I had to try different button combinations.

I don't get it, don't you have a up-to-date autosave now?
Now that was an interesting read. I was part of the ones who thought RLD was the afterlife of DEViANCE. Guess not. Also, interesting how scene drama has barely changed, even compared to the old days. It always consists in bitching about other group's cracking methods, and how they're stealing something from someone. Also, Hoodlum.VS.Reloaded-Bitch-Session-**JEW**   lol.
I usually just use scenenotice.org to find PCISO scenedrama, but damn, browsing the archive and there are so many "unsecure"/"pay2leech" scenenotices.   Oh and also found this on pre.corrupt.net: **ColdIce.and.ZiruX.are.idiots.on.3fn3t-UNPACKME** . It's funny that in #razor on Efnet (Razor demo division) I think  he was actually there, under Zer0x or something, can't remember for sure. That was pre'd in 2006, and I saw him there last year.
Haha, if only that were true. Well, maybe it is, if the protection isn't too tricky :)
Yhup, and marked as spam [here](http://pre.corrupt-net.org/index.php?q=group:Razor1911). God, I was so hyped.
If you mean key store sites... I got BF4 Premium from G2A it worked fine. But after the Ubisoft fiasco (I wasn't affected), I became skeptical about these sites. I know you'll argue "but it workz 4 me!", but to me buying from G2A/Kinguin/etc is no different than buying a cheap DVD from a street seller and praying it works fine.
Huh what?
[X-post] The future of PC-ISO
All the very popular games still get cracked but with no demand for the smaller ones, scene groups don't bother  Actually, I see many meaningless Steam being released by the scene, while titles with lots of demand (FIFA 15 and Dragon Age Inquisition, for example) aren't released, not even [internally](https://scenelingo.wordpress.com/2008/07/16/what-does-internal-mean/).  I think the increasing toughness of DRM is the reason.

I'm gonna give a speech for my Portuguese class which focuses on racial issues. This survey takes like 2 minutes if you're in a hurry, but more if you decide to explain your opinions. Thanks everyone :)
My parents used to go to the supermarket thinking I would close the door when they left. And I usually did, but  one day I had my ear plugs on as I was studying, and didn't hear them leave. After a while, I seem to hear some small noise. I open the door and there are 2 filthy gypsy women in the kitchen. My heart starts racing and I pretend I believe their "oh we thought this home was for rent - or is it your neighbor's?" bullshit, as I'm physically weak and don't want trouble. One of them asked to go to the bathroom while the other one kept developing that fake story. When my parent's arrived, besides cleaning the toilet, they noticed some gold stuff we had (like necklaces we've been offered at our birth) had gone missing.  Now I'm just hoping the government decides to cut welfare for these pieces of cancer. But I doubt it, in Europe we love supporting those who not only do nothing for us, but also damage our lives :)
[OP] Objective Pushers Obliteration   Ah, I'm adding that server to my favorites. I saw tr1plex, Yay_Dogecoins and ONYXGFX on then feed, so I thought it was SAS.
I don't want the next Battlefield to be futuristic   I'm rather new to the Battlefield universe. I've only played BF3 (singleplayer) and BF4 (singleplayer + 400 hours of multiplayer) and I like the fact they offer modern warfare, but not futuristic (at least, not that much until Final Stand). I just don't care for futuristic games with robots and super galactic weapons and stuff like that. I think Titanfall and COD are already enough when it comes to this matter, despite their differences to Battlefield.   Then again, I might be wrong. I didn't play BF2142 after all. What's your opinion?
Oh, I see. thanks!
Yes, I like the way you think, Mr. EA's CEO. Take a sh!t on paying costumers by making a singleplayer game dependent on a stable server connection. And yeah, the online DRM totally worked with Simcity. Everyone could play the game when it was released, and EA got so much love for it. Just like Ubisoft did with their always online DRM a few years ago. Last, but not least, a new study showed that games with aggressive DRM usually sell more. Take a look at Sims 3, for example, it had an uncrackable DRM (CD checks, lol) and thanks to that it sold 10 million units.

You reverse engineer software to understand how it works, and can then do stuff like bypassing the copy protection, analyzing its malicious behavior (if it's a malware) or fix it.   When I didn't know anything at all about reversing, I started reading [these](http://thelegendofrandom.com/blog/sample-page) tutorials. The first ones will introduce you to reverse engineering/cracking, and teach you to use the (main) tool to crack software, called a Disassembler. A Disassembler converts binary/hexadecimal code to instructions of Assembly code.  You see, you can't easily "edit" an .exe. After the guys who make a software program it, they compile it to the .exe, and it's all converted to Assembly code. Assembly code is incredibly confusing and no one in 2014 still programs in it, it's really only used in reversing. [Here's](http://www.ollydbg.de/Pics/OllyDbg2.gif)  what it looks like. I know it looks like hell, but those tutorials I mentioned will explain the basics. At some point, though, you'll want to learn Assembly to make sense of ALL of it.  The disassembler you'll be using is called OllyDBG, the one in that picture. It's included in the tutorials, as everything you possibly need. With it you can see that Assembly code that makes-up programs, see the text strings they have, etc.  They start by teaching you how to crack simple software known as "Crackmes". After a while, easy commercial software will be included, so you can practice on real targets.  By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to crack simple commercial software, although this can be reeaaaly time consuming. Please note cracking DRM like Origin, Steam and Battle.net is much harder than the targets you'll be cracking, and you might only be able to do this after years of reversing.  [Tuts4you](https://forum.tuts4you.com) is a community of reversers who's always glad to help you. One rule, though, is to NEVER give info about what software you're trying to crack.   So here's the more in depth explanation :) Cheers!
Ha, it is indeed. I've spent 15+ hours trying to patch an unpacked VisualBasic program, but still can't. By going deeper into the calls before the conditional jumps that decide *goodboy* or *badboy*, I couldn't find the place where the serial verification is done at startup, and that can get frustrating.
You sir, are a lucky bastard.

I'm from Portugal, and it's hard to find something I like here. We've got beaches, (usually) sunny weather and a cuisine that pleases many foreigners, but unfortunately I don't like any of that. I'd much rather life in a cold, snowy place like the Scandinavian countries or Canada. Oh well, maybe one day :)
