not sure it's a big issue but I would work on having a solid foundation when unracking the weight. On a squat get into a squat position under the bar and then lift to make sure you are in good position...same with OHP, get into that front rack position like a front squat and then use legs to lift weight out of rack  squat: crank your elbows down a bit, this is going to help you keep your frame upright. on a couple reps(especially the last one) it appeared like the weight got forward of you and you were doing a good morning
yup. was priced at $99 a couple weeks ago. They lowered it to [$60](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1631401394) and my work gives us amazon gift cards based off wearing a pedometer and how far we walk :)
I would like to point you towards reddit.com/r/allthingsterran :)   1. i transfer 4-6 ish, once my first command center is slightly below saturation i point both cc's towards second (or maybe even my third)  2. As I low down my 4th cc i tend to stop making scvs. I'm looking for an army of 60-75 ish supply most the time.  3. terran drops? usually a about 3 well placed turrets on corner of you bases will stop most but you can obviously play super safe with more. for zergling counter attacks i make a wall at natural and at 3rd ramps with bunkers by each(usually with 3 marines inside)  4. Thats a really broad question. go over to the allthingsterran subreddit and check out the [build guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/1c9gbb/gosubuilds_update_1_month_after_hots/)

I'm only going to comment on the TvP as I don't feel knowledgeable enough in TvT to help you there.  * 1)you placed that second supply depot way way to early. Either the scv building your rax should start it right after the rax OR that scv should build your 2nd CC when you only have one marine and after that you build your 2nd depot. not game ending but less efficient * 2)I personnally feel like your bunker is a little late...if he marches right across the map with a stalker and zealot you're screwed. * 3)THIS IS THE BIGGEST: IF HE DOES NOT HAVE AN EXPANSION BY THE 6:30-7Minute mark(which btw is a great time to scan) YOU HAVE TO BUNKER UP.  The build works assuming your opponent is macroing too...but now you have to start learning about what you are scouting and what it means and reacting appropriately. Hope that helps :)
yeah i can't even connect to the site. so sad :(
all weekend the streams in the live player were freezing/stopping. I tried talking to support and they either told me i was lying or told me to switch browsers and would not help further. I was really pissed as a paying customer. When i went to twitch.tv I had no problems except not being able to watch high quality...but that was better than everything stopping middle game
Hey robin,  I thought over all you did really well especially when compared to Beta stream last year. If i could give some advice it would be  * i didn't mind the camera work but it did seem off and/or too frequent. When you do a zoom/rotation there needs to be meaning behind it(aka getting a better view of the action) * you need to find a line in between joking caster robin and serious caster robin. I thought when you casted Korean qualifiers with JP you had it spot on...this weekend you seemed a little too "jokey"  but thats just my opinion * you need to become less aware of the camera when you have a cocaster. During the finals when Tumba asked you a question you would speak to the camera with an occasional glimpse to him...it really should be the other way
yeah when i took my post 4 week pics i actually could tell a major difference despite the consistent weight. So i'm not complaining. Week 6 now and going strong
to be fair its still negatives. i can only do half a real pull up now. but i'm getting closer every day! :)
here is what four weeks of classic and eating right has done for me weight wise: http://imgur.com/yk91M  this is my third attempt(and by far the farthest i've gotten) and it was MUCH easier this time. I've got a little soreness but not pain. Hopefully thats what you are doing too.  I would say if possible follow the principles of the fat burner diet (50% protein, 25% carbs, 25% fat) as that is probably the most important part
Week 3 Day 6. No weight loss but a change in muscle/fat composition of my body. I went from having no upper body strength(not being able to do a negative pullup) to better upper body strength(I did 36 negatives last night during the course of legs/back.  I've always been told it takes 21 days to make a habit so i guess the people who drop off after week 2 lack motivation/personal drive(I know i did when i tried before!)
where can i load replays?
