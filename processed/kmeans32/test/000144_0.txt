First, very few emails now days are sent in plain text unencrypted.  Almost all users have started using TLS, which means the emails would be transmitted encrypted in transit.    You missed the point. It doesn't matter if the user accesses his email securely, because the emails themselves are sent over the internet unencrypted. Any server that processes the email (of which there are many "hops") can see it.  On the third point, if you have the key, then you have to be able to see the traffic between the site and the user in order to decrypt it.  That means you have to be tapped in very close to the server or very close to the end user.  Neither of those are easy, most require physical connections at the location.  True a proxy server would be a great way to go, but the user would still need to be using the proxy server.  It is simply too much work to steal an SSL key and then try to get that traffic.  Sure, if it were Amazon or Bank of America, then yea, go for it, having a key like that might be really useful.  Having a key for Bob's Putty Store who sells putty to 20 people a month isn't going to be as useful.  Bob's putty store doesn't need HTTPS if he doesn't need the security of HTTPS. This effectively reduces the security model of HTTPS to HTTP+email interception.  If you signed up for HTTPS, you should expect your keys to be safe.

While it sounds all insecure, really, there are far easier ways of doing that attack that don't require hacking an email, then finding and setting up an MITM style attack or snooping on a connection.  First of all, you don't need to hack an email; these are sent in *plain text unencrypted*, so anyone on the network path it was  on can see them. Second, if it's so useless, why don't you publish all your SSL keys for all the websites under your control?  Third, what "easier" method is there for passive decrypting https connections or actively mitming an https connection than this?   The end user would need to be identified, then a MITM attack or network snooping setup on them.  Or set up a proxy server, then mitm all https connections through it that you've got the key for.
I'll definitely say that the term child abuse can't be applied for 18 and up. Your last sentence is a semantic game and doesn't reflect what the term is used for.  Whether sending out a 16 year old is abuse or not is a more complicated question, and might depend on a lot of factors (are there easily accessible places for them to move, how self-sufficient are they, etc).

This is headed for frontpage of /top. Wonder why it's not there now, has more points than the last one there and top is supposed to sort only by number of votes iirc.  Edit: it's not even in https://www.reddit.com/r/all/top/?sort=top t=week.
Nope.
This title is my equivalent of clickbait.  I think the title accurately described the content, though?
giving the parents a tax-rebate on their tuition is effectively the same thing as giving the school money. everyone can see that, it is just a loophole to make it seem like the taxpayers money isn't going directly to the school. Tax money is going to the school, the middle person doesn't change this fact.  But this is the parents' tax money.  And anyway, as I argued above, the school is performing almost everything the public school is providing. They should get at least some from the government; it's unreasonable to think that their costs of providing regular education is zero.  Also, for the record, do you support school vouchers for non-religious private schools?

I didn't say it wasn't a large part. Read my comment more carefully. And I don't fly any flags, that's just irrelevant.
Could it be that you were paying that to the company, and also paying 2% or so to the issuers? And maybe someone along the way misunderstood and thought the small fee was all there was? Because I really don't think any small business can pay that little based on what I know.
Also unless I skim-read over the top of it, the train scenario didn't give any concrete numbers for exactly how much time it saves, so drawing any conclusion about the consistency of our valuation of time seems suspect.  Pretty sure it specified *exactly* 1 hour.

Yeah.
The problem isn't with the terms, it's that Apple *assumes you agree if you don't say anything*! I'm sure the blog author agrees Apple can demand anything they want in exchange for listing. But considering someone to have agreed to terms when they're silent is silly, and will never hold up in court.  You're basically agreeing to take responsibility for your own content.  Apple is *assuming* you agree, and in order to disabuse them of this notion you must do an action. That's what's unacceptable.

That's actually the worst way to fork. If we don't have 50%, we don't want to switch. We also don't want to force miners to mine larger blocks. You could get around that by specifying some non-backwards compatible protocol change, but I don't see a strong reason for that (I haven't thought a lot about it, though.)  (And seriously, a hard fork isn't enough, you also want to break compatibility with smaller blocks?)

Currently bitcoin is partially decentralized. Bitcoin is such an obscure libertarian play toy that it's decentralized enough to remain secure. If it ever gained any popularity or value, the current decentralization would not be enough to stop it from being attacked.  How can you call something with a market cap of over 1 billion as not gaining value?  If there was enough motivation all you would have to do is convince 3 people in the world and you have control of the majority of the hashing power.  I've said this as well a couple of times. I do think that if bitcoin went significantly up in value, there would be substantially more nodes, and mining would decentralize more.  Also, those 3 people (and in reality, it's 3 companies, which hopefully have multiple people that would need to be compromised) would gain a lot quickly, but would then lose a lot of mining power as miners switched to a different pool. I also think that if the price goes up, miners will have more incentive to switch to smaller pools, because of the very same incentive for attackers.  Do the math, 20mb blocks = 1 TB of dice game spam added to the bloat chain every year. How many people are going to purchase multiple TBs of disk space and give up all of their bandwidth to run a node?  There have been proposals. Note that pruning will allow for the vast majority of the blockchain to be discarded.
That was basically done in the original post (the one with the math and theory) and the response it got is basically "try it yourself"  He doesn't claim to be a physicist.  Never let the ideal textbook calculations or simulations get in the way of empirical data. I test for a living. I learned this my first week on the job 13 years ago.  Which is just.... terrible.  I agree. OTOH, they also mentioned a paper that agreed with them on the math, so either one paper is wrong, or misinterpreted, neither of which I have the expertise to judge.

Having the most money means you can change the system to make sure you keep being the person with the most money sounds like a good idea to you?  Whoever controls 51% of mining can already control what is mined. The only thing about the system that could be changed under this plan is the blocksize.
I'm on an i7, but I think it's in the 3s in GHz. Didn't time anything more than 5.
If you run your own node, then you have the full security of bitcoin as long as at least one node you connect to is honest. You can only be "fooled" into accepting a shorter chain if nobody that has the longer one can communicate with you. Also, if the fake chain is a lot shorter than the correct one, it will likely have very long gaps in between blocks, or the latest block will be far in the past, increasing suspicion.  If there are few nodes, then it's easier for someone to ensure that you connect only to them.

It's a distinction without a difference in this case. So he knew he was doing something illegal, ergo he got caught and is going to jail.  No argument here.  I really don't understand what you are arguing at this point.  Your claim that he "knew he was doing something wrong", which I think is not supported.  I get it, he's is your hero  I haven't said that.

I call ...(spoilers 111)   ... that current!Harry is missing some memories, and that was masterminded by the good guys (either himself or Dumbledore). Additionally, this is causing him to act in a way that appears non-optimal, but is necessary for reasons that will be explained. (Possibly because he needs to believe some things to say them in Parseltongue.)
