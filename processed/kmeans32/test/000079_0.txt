The Guardian - Star Wars: Armada review
If that's the only criteria, [this](https://boardgamegeek.com/search/boardgame?sort=bggrating advsearch=1 q= include%5Bdesignerid%5D= include%5Bpublisherid%5D= geekitemname= range%5Byearpublished%5D%5Bmin%5D= range%5Byearpublished%5D%5Bmax%5D= range%5Bminage%5D%5Bmax%5D= range%5Bnumvoters%5D%5Bmin%5D=100 range%5Bnumweights%5D%5Bmin%5D= range%5Bminplayers%5D%5Bmax%5D= range%5Bmaxplayers%5D%5Bmin%5D= range%5Bleastplaytime%5D%5Bmin%5D= range%5Bplaytime%5D%5Bmax%5D= floatrange%5Bavgrating%5D%5Bmin%5D=7 floatrange%5Bavgrating%5D%5Bmax%5D=10 floatrange%5Bavgweight%5D%5Bmin%5D=4 floatrange%5Bavgweight%5D%5Bmax%5D=5 colfiltertype= searchuser=test_subject2751 nosubtypes%5B0%5D=boardgameexpansion playerrangetype=normal B1=Submit) is probably what you're after.  But **Mage Knight**, **Kanban**/**Vinhos**, **18xx**, **Here I Stand**, **Twilight Imperium** are all heavy games that are on par with Through the Ages but they are vastly different games. It would therefore be more helpful if you provide more information:  What did you like/dislike about Through the Ages? What's your usual player count?
Games new to me:  **The Doge Ship** - An average worker placement game. I'm usually up for dry euros, but I feel like there's mostly tactical play in this game and not enough strategy.   **Formula D** - We played the base game only. A lot of probabilities and calculations involved, but I'd say it's a good game if you don't take the dice rolls too seriously.  Games that I've played before:  **Kanban** - taught it to 3 newbies but they all got on quickly. It's always a blast making jokes about office culture and meetings during the game.  **Panamax** - Probably my second favourite in 2014 after Kanban. Taking the offshore account card secured my win.  **Castles of Mad King Ludwig** - Probably my third favourite in 2014 still. The score updating is still a bit fiddly and the presence of AP players are what my ratings down.  **Agricola** x2 - Made a huge mistake that I probably will not forget whenever I play Agricola in the future....after having the baking tray I used the Major Improvement space to build the clay oven as I forgot that it could be built as a Minor Improvement. Lesson learnt at a severe cost.  **Splendor** - I still enjoy the game as a filler but probably will not voluntarily suggest bringing it out any more.
What are some subtle details that made you think "I wish more board games did this"?   What are specific details that made you appreciate the attention to details that board game designers have put in a game? It may be something subtle in the rule book, designs on the board, player aids etc.  For me, I have found the following useful:  1. Easy reference sheet on the back of the rule book (instead of credits!) to explain various icons so that you don't have waste time flipping through the book.  2. If money is open information and is used frequently, use a resource track on the board to indicate how much each player has. Also makes the game less fiddly.  3. Different icons in addition to player colours for the colour blind players.
Looks like you enjoy Euros so obligatory: **Power Grid**, **Keyflower**, **Eclipse** and **Lords of Waterdeep w/ expansion**.
Have played **Pictomania**. It's one of my favourite party games! The rules are very simple, basically there is a common board of topics on display and you are randomly assigned one of it to draw, but you have to guess other people's drawings quickly at the same time.  There's a variety of difficulty that players can choose, from easy ones like submarine, goat, gardener, to abstract ones like who, bored, insurance.
Awesome! It's interesting to see that it drops off slower than the overall 100.
The paper is thin, like a normal card, so it could get bent easily. I know the tableau doesn't play a significant part in the game (the cards do), but a similar thickness to that of the Imperial Settlers tableau would be much better.
I really enjoyed this game up until the last few rounds. Then it's a repetitive motion to bash the leader because players may only win at the beginning of their turn, not the end. This draws out an extra 30 minutes. Obviously this matters less in a 2 player game.  If it wasn't for this mechanic for game end, I'm pretty sure it would be a top-250 game on bgg.
Pretty solid week for me:  **Roll for the Galaxy** - really enjoyed this. It flows much smoother than Race for the Galaxy as you don't need to stare at your hand often to decide which cards to keep and which to play.  **Spyfall** - quite fun after you know the majority of the available locations. Love it when people come up with creative questions.  **Witness** - mildly amusing light logic game that takes 10 minutes.   **Cyclades** - very cool bidding+area control game that becomes intense in the last few rounds of the game. I thoroughly enjoyed this.  **Lords of Xidit** - I really wanted to enjoy this more but I just can't stand it when people are AP over a simple game.  **Orleans** - my second play. Still enjoyed this but I have a feeling every time the ending of the game would be the same.  **Brass** - messed up some rules in the beginning but we eventually got it right. Very brain-burning but satisfying at the same time. Came close second, if only I chose the right railroads to build, argh!
Games where   1. Players are rewarded for planning ahead (**Terra Mystica**, **Agricola**)  2. Information is mostly open - even if you get backstabbed or blocked by other players, it should be foreseeable.  3. Replayable. Mostly comes with randomised setup.    4. No randomised outcome generator, so every immediate outcome from a decision should be mostly predictable.  5. Feeling of progress within a game. You start out slow on resources and abilities, but you get multiple upgrades during the game.  Basically, I like a game if on my way home I think to myself, damn I should have done this and this instead of that, I was such an idiot!
I go to London on Board too, and I find that it's easier to bond with gamers with similar tastes than convert a friend to a gamer.  I prefer playing with gamers for several reasons:  1. Personal preference for games. Some interactive games (e.g. **Avalon**) probably work better when you play with friends and I'm personally not a big fan of those.  2. More opportunities to try out new games when playing with a group of gamers.  3. More opportunities to play at a competitive level (e.g. tournaments) with a group of gamers.
They are all great choices based on your criteria.   **Glory to Rome** is an excellent game, but I highly doubt you can find a copy for less than $25.  I'm certain you'll enjoy **Race for the Galaxy** and **Star Realms** as you liked **San Juan** and **Dominion**. Just be aware that you directly attack each other in **Star Realms** in case that's an issue. Also, you can try out **Race for the Galaxy** for free on boardgamearena first.
Probably not a common gripe but only my own for **Lords of Waterdeep**. I find the initial 2 quests+lords randomly dealt to a player involving too much luck. I usually go with card drafting for the initial 2 quests, then deal 2 keep 1 for lords.
**Ingenious** is quite similar to Quirkle. Most of Knizia's games are abstract math games, examples include **Ra**, **Lost Cities** and **Kingdoms**.
Unlike Agricola, Caverna rewards you for specialising, so focus on one-two main scoring elements. Also, remember to use rubies at the right time, e.g. getting a tunnel before building a mine/animal right before breeding/using a high level dwarf etc. Sometimes it even takes opponents by surprise.  Not sure about the balance in weapons in a 3p game, as you said, it's powerful if only one does it. If two do it, the other person can easily build a strong farm+animal engine very easily. It's usually well balanced in a 4p game.
Based on the aspects you like, I recommend:   **Terra Mystica** - It's a game about expanding your control on a map trying to form towns, while different buildings give you different income and abilities. No randomness after initial setup, not much direct conflict, managing the use of 3 resources (workers, money, power). There are no changing cost of resources though.  **Brass** - Economic game about connecting your industry empire to trade coal/steel/cotton. There's changing cost of resources. Not much direct conflict. Slight randomness due to card drawing.   Alternatively, buy more expansions of **Power Grid** if you're just bored of the base map and power plants!
For every single game, there will always be people who hate it/regret buying/rate as a 1 on BGG etc. I think it's always important to decide for yourself (and your group) whether you like a game or not, especially when trying out a new type.   It's also a very popular game so it's also likely that you could trade/sell it away if you didn't like it after all.
Played for the first time:  **Panamax**: Really liked it, definitely in my top 5 for 2014. The rules explanation takes quite a while, but once we started playing everything is quite straight forward. It comes down to either (1) take a contract and load cargo; or (2) Move the ships. Players need to balance the pace well - shipping everything in a round might boost income and save costs, but it might be very difficult to avoid costs in the next round.  **City hall**: A worker placement + bidding game. Played this with 3 players. Was not impressed as I won by exploiting the health commissioned spot early on which seemed too powerful to me.  Games that I've played before: **Small World**, **Viticulture**, **Coloretto**
What are some Causes   Effects that most people don't realise?
It was a good week!  New games played:  **Mage Knight**: Bought this second hand at a bargain and played the tutorial (exploring) game solo. Already now that I'll love it.  **Five Tribes**: Solid game. I find it more tactical/opportunistic than strategic. Just don't play with players with AP.  **Lost Valley**: Tile laying Euro with a badly written rule book. Turns are quite simple so a game was quick. We all felt that this game was just a bit short of being a fantastic game.  **Via Appia**: Fun light game which reminds us of arcade games.  **Valley of the Kings**: Great deckbuilding game with set collection for a small box. I plan to buy this one.  **Glen More**: Fun little tile laying + resource management Euro. Really liked the turn order mechanic. I'll buy this if I have the chance as well.  Games that I've played before: **Ingenious**,**Lords of Waterdeep**, **Agricola**, **Port Royal**. **Star Realms**, **Fresco**, **Dominant Species**, **Greed**, **Biblios**
[Review] Rahdo Runs Through: Subdivision
**Martin Wallace** - If you like managing money and cashflows, you'll love his games: London, Brass, Steam.  Also games that are slightly chaotic: A Study in Emerald, Discworld.  Heard good things about A Few Acres of Snow but have not personally tried yet.
I have yet to try this, thanks!
A good week for me.  New games I tried:  **Suburbia**: loved it. Lots of strategic planning, with a moderate degree of interaction so it's exactly my type of game. I love how we all create some back story for describing each of our cities as we go along.  **Cosmic Encounter**: Was somewhat fun but a bit too confrontational and chaotic for me.  **Arctic Scavenger**: Nice deck builder with some theme and interaction. Would like to play with the role cards next time.  **One Night Ultimate Werewolf**: I normally stay away from party games but this is short enough for me to be able to enjoy it.  **In the Year of the Dragon**: Another Feld that I enjoy. Probably the most unforgiving game of his but I really liked the mechanics.  **La Citta**: Was pleasantly surprised by this city building game. Early actions are hugely important.  Games that I've played before:  **Loot**, **Agricola**, **Tzolkin**, **Alhambra**, **Coloretto**, **Quantum**,**For Sale**,**Tsuro**,**Mascarade**
Thanks! I'm not sure how to get the sizing correct as I've heard many people say it stretches a lot and it needs to be downsized 2-3 inches. So if I go to a retail store the "correct size" wouldn't feel comfortable right? How could I tell if I found the correct pair?
