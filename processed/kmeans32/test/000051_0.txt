Apparently, I never expected this reception O_o How do you kill that which has no life?
The drunkest dankest gril that ever was...
Nah, still lacking the wubdub's and Airhorn symphony.
Hmmm, Are you green with envy?
Mentlegen!
Feel free to plop one on! Just make sure to link your masterpiece so we all can enjoy. :V
Feel free to "fix it" as much as you want. :P
Here is Version 2 of MLG Ibuki with a backdrop.
I thought that was a jp youtube site? I did not bother to login to find out if it was or not. Either way I supplied the author name.
I am not sure if this is the best place to put it but I just made a heavily edited MLG Ibuki.
Thank you for the advice, I try to finish what I started and then I leave, fortunately it worked out in the end and I was not coached.
Thanks Captain Hindsight!
I will definitely try this, thank you!
Thank you, that is incredibly helpful. I am going to try to arrange a meeting right now.
He was trying to force me to stay past my clock out time, when I am in a good mood I will volunteer time to help clean up and do more work, they will have me burn off the overtime later as a result. If he had actually asked me, it wouldn't have been as big of a deal.
Thank you for the response, luckily there were a few people around, including my fellow IMS co-worker, so I should be covered as far as witnesses go.
Thank you for the quick response! I agree due to the additional XP drain when trying to level using Carrier/Helios.
Does anybody know when they gave us the ability to unequip a sentinels weapon? I logged on today and was able to successfully remove it from my carrier.   However I cant seem to find any mention anywhere in the patch notes and I was wondering if this had been awhile ago or not... Thanks in advance!
Samsung Galaxy tab 3 7 inch takes an estimated 10 minutes to boot...     I dropped my Samsung Galaxy tab 3 in the toilet a while back. All the water should be out of the system, however while the device seems to be fully functional with some input delay that hadn't been there before, except for the whole "ten minutes to boot" deal.     Now this would not be too big of a problem if the device didn't already have a glitch where it would crash if plugged into a micro USB occasionally...    I have factory restored it for the hell of it, it still connects to my desktop and I can access the device. I would appreciate any advice or suggestions.

I will keep that in mind, I appreciate it!
Thank you for the link. That should come in handy!
Thank you for such a thorough list! I was in a hurry when taking pictures and the tools were everywhere, so it was kind of chaotic and I appreciate you taking the time to go through them like that!
I need help with identifying a large amount of tools ranging from the 1920s to the 1990s.    **Thank you for all the responses, that should be all that is needed for now. I really appreciate it.**    So I am in kind of a predicament where I need to sort a lot of tools in 7 days before the house I am in is being put up for sale and potentially everything in it thrown away if not removed at that time.  https://imgur.com/a/vzQm1#0       My great grandpa was alive from the 1920s up until the 1990s. A lot of this stuff I have found I know what they are. But I need to prioritize what is actually of value for keepsakes and what is not.   I will be going back down later today to snap a few more pictures of items I missed. I would appreciate any kind of help I could get.  If you see a specific type of tool or item in the pile please circle it or identify in someway I can understand since I do not know most of what these are called.

Shame and thanks for the confirmation. Ill just have to back up a bunch of the music, even the ones I have not fully decided whether I "like" them currently or not.
Where in the world is Ozzwald?   What happened with Ozzwald and his/her youtube channel and all the associated music/remixes they made? I could not find any information other than that they are all gone.  Its a real shame at least to me because I really appreciated their Gypsy Bard remix but all I can find is a speedycake and one poor quality upload such as this. http://youtu.be/v4rNysM51kA   sidenote: I have his original song still and I was trying to tag it with a link to his youtube upload.
