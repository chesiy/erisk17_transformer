4 post about MH 17 (Something from a year ago) in the last 2 hours, but only 1 about Jade Helm, that's still going on?
A U.S. official says the gunman in the shootings in Tennessee has been identified as 24-year-old Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez.
So, if I go to Texas, I can open carry firearms in the House of Representatives?
A search of "Hilary" in /r/politics is showing the newest posts to be things like:   Martin OMalley Criticizes Hillary Clinton for Flip-Flopping   Hillary Clinton Said to Hire Former Wall Street Cop as Campaign CFO   Hillary Clinton's presidential announcement video is creepy    Gutfeld: Hillary's Campaign Rollout More Staged Than 'My Fair Lady'   How John Roberts Made Hillary Clinton President   Hillary Clinton campaign to accept lobbyist donations   Doesn't seem  like /r/politics is trying to justify Hillary at all.
It's been two year since Ted Nugent was supposed to be dead or in jail if Obama was reelected, so we at least know that making a prediction like that one or calling the President a subhuman mongrel, doesn't fit the criteria for who gets on the kill list.
Ten lines in "The government ought to leave non-violent offenders alone," said Paul. "If a guy is selling loose cigarettes and not paying the king's ransom in taxes, couldn't we give him a ticket instead of throwing him to the pavement?  Maybe you should read more than the first paragraph. This about more than drugs, he even mentions people being jailed for nonpayment of court ordered child support.
You'd have to get remarried if you move to a different state, if not, then it wouldn't stop gay marriage because gays would just go to another state to get married and come right back, thus nullifying any state law against gay marriages.
I suspect that about a hundred people, all with a couple dozen accounts and no job or much of a life, sustain these subs and make then appear more popular than they really are.
officials confessed that nearly 4,000 illegal immigrants had been accidentally steered from the states low-income Medicaid program and instead were enrolled in Obamacare    So basically, people who were getting free government health care from the State, are now getting government assistance to pay for private healthcare from the Federal Government?
Me too. I was like "Just because they found a 19th century pear point in a freshly killed whale in the 90's, doesn't mean it was thrown by a 19th century guy." That's when I realized they meant the whales had been alive since the 19th century and I am a dumbass.
Good. I like this. It makes me happy. People who refuse to buy health insurance screw over the rest of us when they run up huge medical bills they can't pay by causing the hospitals to charge the rest of us higher prices to make up the difference which leaves insurers no choice but to raise our rates. I'll be glad to see them voluntarily paying higher taxes that they could have avoided by simply buying something that they needed to buy in the first place. They're no better than people who build their house in a floodplain and expect FEMA to bail them out every ten years.
I actually feel kind of bad for the conservatives now, as long as the emails were missing, they could fantasize about what was in them, now it'll be Benghazi all over again.
I don't see how ranked-choice voting would have changed anything for me on Tuesday. In nine of fourteen races there was only one person running and in the other five, there were only two. No third parties or independents on the ballot at all.
Respect, actually looking people in the eyes and saying "good morning", not "sup". Getting off your phone when you go in a restaurant or store, acknowledging the cashier or waitstaff as being a human being and not an ATM or something. Asking if you can take a picture first.
When Kalashnikov died, I posted a story from CBS news. I didn't edit the headline which used the term "assault rifle". The first and only comment was about my "poor choice of words" followed by my being banned from r/guns.
I have also heard that there was no Ebola in the U.S. until after Obamacare was passed and it may be responsible for the attack on the Canadian Parliament.
"You see, it's been our misfortune to have the wrong religion. Why didn't we have the religion of the Japanese, who regard sacrifice for the Fatherland as the highest good? The Mohammedan religion [Islam] too would have been more compatible to us than Christianity. Why did it have to be Christianity with its meekness and flabbiness?"  Adolf Hitler Quoted by Albert Speer, Inside the Third Reich: Memoirs, pg. 115  http://wikiislam.net/wiki/Quotations_on_Islam_from_Notable_Non-Muslims#Adolf_Hitler
I'll just leave [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6hRDS3LvQQ) here.
Don't you just love how they announce that they're partisan right in the name of the site, "Welcome, come on in and rest assured that you won't read anything here that disagrees with your preconceived notions".
Susteren then asked Higbie about his time as a Navy SEAL, As a Navy SEAL, you have trained foreign troops? Right? How many times? More than one trip to Iraq?  Absolutely, we did two deployments, Higbie said. We did one in 2007 and in 2009. We did this foreign international defense over there, and its not effective. They dont have the accountability, and the understanding, and the actual fortitude to fight an enemy like ISIS whos dedicated. Theyre willing to die for this cause.  So, you didn't do the job that we sent you there to do?
Pretty sure naturalized citizens already pay income taxes and according to your linked article   Census said income households led by foreign-born workers, which includes non citizens and naturalized citizens, rose 1.7 percent over the same period of time.   62% of naturalized citizens are employed, as opposed to 58.6% for the whole country, the biggest percentage of naturalized citizens is in the management category: 38.2%, and  80% of employed naturalized citizens make more than $25,000 per year.  http://www.americanbanker.com/bankthink/looking-for-new-mortgage-leads-try-naturalized-citizens-1069738-1.html
What I never see explained in these type of stories is how common burglars and carjackers know that there has been an increase in the amount of concealed carry permits being issued and therefore a greater chance that their potential victim may be armed, do they go down to the sheriff's office and ask? And if the lowest rungs of the criminal element aren't aware that there are more people with guns, then how is it a deterrent?
This is a least two years old and he is still employed by Fox News.  http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/personalities/andrew-p-napolitano/bio/#s=m-q
Considering that in 1937 a dime would buy you a copy of Time magazine, a comic book or two cokes, I think it would be a little more than that.
National Guard in Texas to make arrests and apprehensions, something Guard troops in past border deployments have been prohibited from doing
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Sunday laid out what he said was overwhelming evidence of Russian complicity in the downing of a Malaysian airliner in eastern Ukraine
I don't trust news stories from sources that tell me in the opening paragraph, how I'm supposed to feel about or react to the information in their stories. That's not only a sure sign of propaganda, but bad propaganda at that.
Interesting, but I don't see how this is "political".
There's only 45 million black people in the U.S., they could just give them all a million dollars a piece, have money left over and call it reparations and say "look what the Republican party did for you. Not the Democrats, not the government, the GOP did this for you."
According to the New York Times, the President has decided to kill the existing NSA phone metadata program and come up with a substitute that leaves the metadata with the phone companies.
Rand Paul has charisma, fundraising power, and new ideas. Now if only he can resolve his sticky habit for bending the facts.
