Yeah this offends me so take it down.
Me and this guy who is a underground rapper from Memphis was playing checkers in an abandoned trailer one night back in 1997. He started beating me and I got pissed off, took the checker board and chunked that shit in the air. Well after we picked all those checkers up, he got knocked upside the head by a checker that came outta nowhere A MINUTE AFTER WE PICKED THEM ALL UP.  Rapper friend gets hit in head by phantom checker in an abandoned trailer.   EDIT : Got downvoted cause nobody believes me.
I have no clue but I been listening to Local X alot more. It has that 93X vibe to it.
I have a metric fuckton of 60s-00s Richie Rich and Hot Stuff comics in the same shape. I usually sell them for 25 cents each because not much of a demand here for kid books.
Live between Memphis and Jackson,Tn. All I can say is stay away from East Jackson, Orange Mound and East St.Louis. Anyone know about Paducah?
The fedora is strong with this one.
I may have said this long ago but I really think I ate breakfast with a serial killer once.
Nah. Phantom Stranger isn't obscure. But I have a fan theory about one obscure DC hero. I really do think this makes sense. Dial H For Hero : That dial is a cosmic multiversale construct on the same level as the Time Knife, the Book Of Crime, the Omni-Gauntlets,etc. The Dial possessor switches places with a hero on Earth H. It's a very very powerful multiversal device on par with the Ultimate Nullifier. We just haven't seen the full potential of it yet.
Holy fuck.
You did not mention Slayer, Pantera,Anthrax, Megadeth, Testament, Iron Maiden or any good metal. Slipknot is ok. First album is meh. Iowa is the shit. Vol. 3 is ok.
But Denver has legal pot!
Was you expecting Shakespeare?
You need any early 80s X-Men for some them DC stuff?

That's like half of reddit!
I googled Zippos and found this.
No, because reddits is not a part of free culture and never was. It's a private company that has the right to run its business however it sees fit. If you don't like it, leave.   I asked a question so please chill. Offended by a question? Then you are part of the problem.    Those of us who are capable of respecting and appreciating each other will not miss you one bit.  Why so offended by a simple question? Did the fedora get too tight around the fat that you have to want me to leave? Bitch please.  I hope and pray that this is just the beginning of the cleansing of reddit. Fatpeoplehate was a good start.  No. It was not. you got some really horrible subreddits of dead kids and your chubby ass gets all silly about r/fatpeoplehate?   There are more that deserve to meet the same fate. That a threat or a promise?

I grew up watching you on Remote Control and Who's The Man? You are a funny fella, anywho I got a few questions to ask.   1) Tough Crowd ever gonna be on Netflix or released on DVD? 2) You ever meet Bill Hicks? (I want to say that Patrice O'neal was the Black Man's answer to Bill Hicks) 3) You ever see a worse move that this? It's called Hawkeye and it is sad. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOMitpwKJh4
I helped out on the knowledge thread at totse back in 2005-2007. Here is the link http://www.scribd.com/doc/10626424/totse-knowledge-thread-1#scribd
Nothing is wrong with Spawn. Most 90's thing would be Youngblood Pogs.
If she says you got a little dick, just tell her she has big hands.

But I did not tell you about the man who answered the door naked with a poodle.

Nippleneck - A complete waste of a human being.  Bobbing - Created this after a old friend of mine we called "Dirty Bob" would wear the same clothes every day for months at a time without him taking any showers.  Fucknugget - Another name for a Alabama Hot Pocket.
also wouldn't be an old image that this reporter simply doesn't recognize. Ted Kord has only ever shared a single panel with this version of Booster Gold before -- in Futures End: Booster Gold. That issue saw Booster careening out of control through DC's Multiverse, before ending up "home" in the pre-Flashpoint DC Universe. The armored costume -- generally depicted with an A.R.G.U.S. emblem on it, although not here -- first appeared in the Justice League International Annual #1 in the New 52, meaning that Ted Kord was not a superhero and shared no history with Booster Gold when that look debuted.  It's likely that this Booster Gold is the same one who, in a different uniform, lent guidance and occasional surreptitious assitance to his younger self and his son Rip Hunter during Booster Gold Volume 2. That "Older Booster" was last seen just before Flashpoint during the Time Masters: Vanishing Point miniseries tied to the Return of Bruce Wayne event. That version of Booster would have been the one whose younger self worked extensively with Blue Beetle on the JLI and later the Justice League America.  Currently, the pair of old friends and former Justice Leaguers are working together in Justice League 3000...but that doesn't take place in the "regular" DC Universe, but instead in a similar universe where Keith Giffen and J.M. DeMatteis' humor-tinged, nostalgic take on the Justice League International is the standard. That world is a version of the pre-New 52 DC Universe, but one in which (among other things) Ralph Dibny isn't dead and Max Lord never went evil.    DC is a clusterfuck.
Thank you
Pardon My Blooper. A Kermit Schaefer blooper film.   A collection of classic bloopers (mistakes) from radio and television broadcasts, based on Kermit Schafer's blooper books and recordings. Never heard of it or seen it...anyone else?  Here is the IMDB link of the film in question http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0304519/
I actually spread a rumor in my town about a Los Locos gang. Hanging out at the park, jumping out of nowhere, singing songs and shit. People believed me.
Recently bought a 3DO for a buck at a yard sale and need help!   I recently bought a 3DO panasonic system at a garage sale for a buck yesterday! Kinda dirty but cleaned it off and hooked it up. IT WORKED! Now I need games for it. This may not be the right place for this question,but I need help searching for homebrew games or 3DO .iso files.
