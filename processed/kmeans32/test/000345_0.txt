I was stoked on it actually...the photo montage is mine.  I whip this up all the time now.  The trick is to get the pan super-hot so you get a nice sear on the chokes.  It's a 2 min recipe that's perfect for guests to snack on while you finish cooking the main dish!  \m/

I dunno, I've tried all the ones I mentioned - Bloomfield is cool cuz you can opt to just go out to the farm and pick everything yourself which is really neat (http://www.bloomfieldorganics.com/upick/) - we're just finishing our Twin Palms CSA now for the season which has been great.  I think we're just gonna do farmers markets for a while and see how that goes - too much fucking KALE lately. \m/

Man, I never talk about it....when my daughter was 2, I was out front flipping my 800lb strongman tire in front of the garage.  I had been drinking w/ friends and was showing off.  I was just finishing a flip whe I saw my daughter out of the corner of my eye run right under the tire just a fraction of a second before it smacked down on the concrete.  She would have been crushed to death.  That was 8 years ago.
Thanks!
