"Prakash" was using an alias from the outset, besides which he was no innocent man.   But, I have his lap-top now, and all his accounts were logged in when I found it in his living room. I don't much care if his reputation, and my confession get buried as far down as him.
That after his death his online accounts will be anonymously usurped and his reputation ruined.
I'm *really* sorry to hear about your sister, man. Do whatever you can to defender her, once you get out. Creepy-ass brothel owner...I tell you man, it's this damn city. It attracts the worst kind.
Nothing but great things, I'm sure. ;)
This Twigsy guy really knows his craft. I've got to respect that on some level.
You vaguely remind me of my creepy-ass, late brother-in-law.
Aneurysm my ass, she was young and in great health, doesn't make sense.
Thanks a lot, yaar :)
Thank you.
Thank you very sincerely. I'm thankful that I shared Diane's final act of love and devotion. Sharing it feels less lonely.
Mujhe apni patni ki yada a raha hai apna khayal rakhna, dost. maf kijiye, mujhe Hindi nahee ati hai. mai U.S. se hum. My mom's from Delhi but my dad's from the South. We mostly spoke English at home. Apna Khyal Rakhna.
My dad is Tamil, and my mom's from Delhi. They met here in the U.S. though. I didn't feel a particularly strong connection to North or South, which is I guess, why I wound up marrying a gora...
That's a sweet proposal story! I guesstimated my wife's ring size by casually letting her mess around with an old ring I normally wore. When she slipped it on, it seemed to fit perfectly, so I figured "If it fits me, it'll fit her" was a good philosophy for engagement ring shopping.   Then when I bought the ring it was too big for her. Apparently my own ring was slightly tight on me and slightly loose on her.   It was ok, because it's always easier to resize a too big ring than a too small ring (plus, a girl will feel embarrassed if her finger is too big to fit into the ring). Unfortunately I hadn't purchased the "re-sizing insurance" thing, so it was extra.    TLDR: Always buy a slightly too big ring, and re-sizing insurance.
Yes it's my name (I don't normally give personal information, but I figured first names would be ok because I didn't expect many people to see this). I grew up in the U.S., but my parents are Indian. Take care.
I keep getting comments like this, but I really don't know how to answer. I mean...can you imagine my own confusion?
Yes, we had played it, plus the left-overs and coffee were still out. That's how I know it wasn't a dream, and that I hadn't just woken up in bed and found her.   I just got back from a three week long trip with my brother where we stayed with my aunt and uncle. I've been surrounded by nothing but friends and family, which definitely helps.
I know I was conscious. The mugs and plates were still out from the coffee and left-overs we had.
She was decent. She enjoyed solving the tests, but to be honest I think she liked the story lines more. Sometimes she got frustrated and watch walk-throughs. She also liked to watch me play.
It's not silly at all. Diane and I always kept a white-board on our fridge, where we'd write things we needed to do, and our shopping list.   Some things (errands we hadn't gotten to yet, and frequently purchased groceries) would just stay on there, cluttering up the board forever.   The other day I went through the list to erase the things that had already gotten done (mostly things pertaining to Diane's funeral services, and my recent trip to India).   I don't drink cashew milk, but Diane kept it on the list. I started choking up right after I erased it.
At first I did. I really really did. I sobbed for hours just thinking "why did I go in". I spent days on the couch wishing I could see her standing over me.   But ultimately, I don't think I can regret going in.   I know that Diane must have been a very pure soul to achieve something like that, almost pure enough to attain Moksha (in Hinduism, it's freedom from rebirth. An extremely perfect state. Its *way* better than rebirth, but it's hard for we who aren't very spiritually advanced yet to grasp).   I can't help that I wish I could see her again. But I also fear that her attachment to me could hinder her on her journey.  I'm sure that when she departed, she took birth in much better circumstances than in our house, worrying about me.
That's so very sad, I can't even stand to picture my wife in that situation. I wish that coupled had gotten the last moments together Diane and I had. When I first learned learned her death was caused by an aneurysm, it seemed like something that must be incredibly rare. But now when I tell people about it, it feels like everybody knows of someone who's died this way.
Thank you. I think I will. Eventually.
Thank you for your kind words. I'm grateful that my experience can be meaningful to others.
Haha, that's sweet. I'm happy for you guys, treasure each other.
Thank you for your kind words.
Please do. I'm happy for you and your wife, it's a comforting reminder that joy and love still exist out there, even if *I* am sort of on pause for a bit.   Please, forget trivial disagreements, realize the value in every moment and make as many pleasant memories together as you can.
Thank you. I know maybe it sounds cliche, but writing about it has been a little therapeutic.
Thank you. It happened little over a month ago. It took me some time to bring myself to write about it.   I've told a few people I'm close to. Most seemed sympathetic (or at least didn't verbalized their skepticism).
My wife didn't want me to go into the bedroom.   Hi R/Nosleep. I havn't been able to sleep for a while.   Sometimes I stay up late. I love my wife, so much. So so much. But, sometimes I stay up late. My wife goes to bed, and I stay up. Redditing or playing video games, or watching T.V...   I'd fallen asleep on the couch as I often do, and I awoke to my wife standing over me, crying, shaking me awake. I asked her what was wrong, but for a while she didn't speak. She just hugged me and sobbed. I stroked her hair and comforted her.   I wondered if she might have had a dream that I died or something, or if maybe she'd received a text with some tragic news. Finally when she calmed down a little she said "Let's just sit together for a while."   "Do you want to tell me what happened?" I asked. She seemed to think about it, and decide against it. "No. I just want to spend some time with you, for a little while."   "I'm tired." I said, stretching. "Let's get in bed." "No!" she almost seemed to shout. "No. I don't want to go in the bedroom right now." I was concerned, but my wife could be a tad eccentric, sometimes even charmingly child like. Maybe going back in there would remind her of a nightmare she'd had?  We wound up sitting on the couch chatting. About anything and everything under the sun (except for what had upset her). We played portal.   She made coffee, and we snacked on some left overs. We laughed, we reminisced about the early days of our relationship. Before we knew it, it was 7:00am. "I'm too tired, sweetheart, and I'm sure you are too. Let's get some rest so we don't waste our entire Saturday."  "No! We can't! Please!" She cried. "Why!?" I asked "What's the matter?"   "We just can't go in there. Please. If we go in, it'll be over." She said, her eyes welling up with tears.  "What!? What's in the bedroom?" (I was really confused. Had she accidentally broken some heirloom, and she was afraid I'd be upset with her?)   There was a long silenced as she fought back sobs. Then finally...  "My body is in there! I'm dead, Prakash. I saw my dead body, lying on the bed. Once you see it, it'll be over."   This was a bit much. Obviously she'd had some nightmare, that she'd believed was real.   "Oh, sweetheart, no. No...it was just a bad dream. Everything is ok." I hugged her as she sobbed. "Look, you're just sleep deprived. You'll feel better when you wake up. I promise."  She nodded somberly, then walked silently, with me to the bedroom. I gestured to the empty bed, completely devoid of bodies.   "See there? It was a dream. Lay here with me." I flopped onto the bed playfully and then propped myself up on my elbow, to chat until we slept. She laid down next to me and closed her eyes.   "So, what had you dreamt?" I asked. She didn't answer. "Diane?" I asked. "Did you really fall asleep that quickly?" I laughed.    I shook her, and she was stiff. I noticed her lips were a little blue around the edges. Next I noticed she wasn't breathing.   Of course I panicked.   Of course I called 911.   She was only 27 years old. An aneurysm in her sleep. The coroner said she'd been dead for five or six hours before I "found her body".    I miss her so so much. I hope my promise is kept - where ever she is now, where ever she woke up, I hope she feels better.    [Sleep well, everyone.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3e485v/prakash_must_die/)
I saw her walk *through* a glass window, once. Like, just kind of *phased* through the window above my bed, as though it was open.   I think she can pass through anything light can pass through. If you have wooden shutters, try locking them, or otherwise obscuring points of entry for light.
Holy shit. I'd definitely try to stay on Matt's good side, if I were you.
That is terrifying, do you have someone else you can stay with for a while? Dogs are a great alarm system and source of protection, please get one!
