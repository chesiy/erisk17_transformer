I also just saw Southpaw (no spoilers)   All I can say is wow. Jake Gyllenhaal is unrecognizable from his character in Nightcrawler and did a phenomenal job which just goes to show the range he can achieve. While the plot is a little predictable, the movie really is great and the performances are very believable (especially from the daughter, Oona Laurence). On a final note, James Horner's score was amazing and really added to the feel of the whole movie. As someone who's not really into sports films, this movie really was wonderful and I recommend you all go see it if you get the chance.
I've never had anyone say anything about it. Most people don't care, but there's always a chance you'll get someone that's a little too serious about these things.
First: 2007 Suzuki SX4 Automatic  That car has a lot of sentimental value to me and I get a little happy when I see them.  Now: 2004 Subaru WRX 5-Speed  I fucking love this car. Period.
[Meta] Sorry for inactivity   I just thought I'd give a reason. I've been getting ready and packing and stuff and moved into my dorms today. I should be posting regularly again this week.
Yep. I'll have my wiki updated by the end of the day.
DO NOT QUESTION THE MOTIVES OF LIECHTENSTEIN!
[News] Hchste Kaiser's Word 2022   This year was rather in eventful for Liechtenstein.  Our eternal leader unveiled his joint project with France, the AT-23 Spectre Multi-Terrain Vehicle. This vehicle can be exported to any country willing to pay and only France and Liechtenstein hold the rights to manufacture them.  Second and lastly, Hchste Kaiser offered refuge to monsoon victims and offered supplies and refuge to all involved in the Argentina conflict.  This has been Hchste Kaiser's Word 2022. Tune in next year for your only yearly choice in national news.  Next: TV Static with Hchste Kaiser
[Event] Liechtenstein extends a welcoming hand to Luxembourg's new AI leaders   Despite the controversy that the seizing of power has caused, we believe that the instant decision to declare war on your nation is a very rash decision. Therefore, Liechtenstein would like to extend its congratulations and hopes that, upon the reopening of the borders, Luxembourg would be willing to peacefully negotiate trade relations amongst other things with the people of Liechtenstein.  Hopefully,  Hchste Kaiser of Liechtenstein, /u/test_subject7429  Meta Edit: Shit.
[News] Liechtenstein's fraction of a year   The newest leader of the great nation of Liechtenstein began his eternal term this year rather successfully. He was able to bring the country's military strength up well over what was necessary. When questioned, the Hchste Kaiser responded, "What the hell does 'moderation' mean?" The nation's great leader was then given a dictionary and, upon reading the definition, had the reporter publicly executed.  As of now, the nation's borders are still closed due to the bacterial crisis in Africa and will only be opened for reasons of the utmost importance.  In other news, the Hchste Kaiser has said that he won't nor will he ever recognize Duck Rights.  That's all for now, but tune in next year for Hchste Kaiser's Word. You're only choice in Liechtenstein national news.  On next: Cooking with Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429
There's a whole sub if you didn't know! /r/reclaimedbynature sadly it doesn't seem to be very active at this time.
I finally get to one of these early enough and I can't think of a question! I'll just settle with saying that the game looks amazing and I'm excited to see where else it goes! Big fan of Obsidion. Good luck!  Edit: OOH! I thought of some. What thing about PoE has you most excited? Also, what would you say is the most unique thing about the game?
Oh, I see. Thanks!
I was seriously thinking it was the one I usually go to.... But your comment has made me second guess myself.
Nah, just as fun, though.
In quite a butthurt fashion, might I say.
That's an awfully curvy L, don't you think?  Edit: in all seriousness, though, that's pretty cool.
