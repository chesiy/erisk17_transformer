In four articles and two forum threads I found only a single mention that said the limits would be reevaluated at the end of the year but nothing guaranteeing that are not going to be continued...
Fly those flags people
Yeah, I saw that a while ago (I'm one of those people who follows him on Twitter after having seen many times, "You'd know this already if you followed me on Twitter").  To be fair though he was being pretty silly.  He could have just as easily parked the car rather than go through the drivethrough backwards.  He was being...Doug DeMuro.
See, that's funny...I don't find broccoli rabe bitter.  I get it on pizza sometimes at a place we like to go do.  Might have it tonight in fact.
Eight and a half years?  Wow dude (I'm assuming dude).  That's a long time to keep a secret.  You were probably all psyched up for one or two different potential mind blowing reactions and when she was just "that's nice dear, I love you; please pass the salt" you didn't know what to do with yourself.  Props for finally being honest with the person you share your life with though.  They're always the hardest when they ought to be the easiest.  Funny huh?  I made it a point a long time ago to basically "come out" on the first date...My current (and likely final; going to follow Beyonc's advice one of these days...) girlfriend embraces it completely.  Hell - she'd watch if I'd let her (not that we have an open relationship nor do I believe in that sort of thing but it's a fantasy of hers).  And hey, if you can be someone's fantasy then that's pretty awesome ;)
There is a reason I have a meme pic of Grumpy Cat saying "I AM smiling" above my desk.  Also, diagnosed?  INTJ isn't a condition, internet person.  It is a part of who you (and some of us) are.  It's not a bad thing.  It's not a good thing.  it's just A thing.  People will not always understand you.  That's their problem.
So that car we saw at Boxerfest and then later it showed up to the afterparty/dyno day at Pure Auto.  The louvers look really good on the car in motion.  Stupid, stupid expensive though.
No.
That's because a 225/40-18 is half an inch bigger in diameter than the stock 215/45-17.  A 225/35 would've been .4 inches smaller.  OP did about the best he could do, but I'd have gone smaller personally.  That combo probably weighs a ton more than stock given XXRs and Chinese tires.

Yeah.  The bottom bolt was oily and harder to break free than the rest but I got it out.  Was afraid it was cross threaded because it was tight all the way out but it wasn't thank the car gods.  So it's take out all three bolts, use a long flathead screw driver to pry the stock plate off, clean off the mating surface with brake cleaner (and a razor blade if there's any RTV residue), dab some Permatex ultra grey on the parting lines between the cylinder and head (top and bottom), rub some oil on the new plate's gasket, then mount up the new plate and finger tighten the screws; come back after an hour and torque it to spec.  Then, let cure for 24 hours.  I'm sure it also helps that I have a lithium battery that's less than half the size of the stocker too.  Gives a lot more space to work.  Here's the new plate:  [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/nuz6XQ8.jpg)
I just...don't even know what to say about this.  It snowed four inches overnight.  It's still snowing here.  Last week we had a night of 8 inches.  Second winter where I live and I've never seen a single person driving with chains on.  And you're doing this just in case for the one day it might snow an inch in Atlanta?  I...I don't get it?
That is not MY Battlefield theme...  http://youtu.be/vg0Tmydj29M
Yes, I do upgrade my PC.  I bought my last rather than do a homebuild, but since then I've upgraded storage twice (small SSD and then a larger SSD, swapping the small SSD into my bedroom HTPC), and graphics card to a newer single then an SLI configuration.  Processor, I still haven't needed as I'm just at 1080P on my living room TV and I've gotten tired of FPSs.  I certainly understand the parallels - I think though it's probably a case of a phone being much more important to some folks than they are to me, since I can't really do anything with it for work like a lot of folks seem to.  Thanks all for the explainers :)
It's not a conspiracy, nor is it a theory.  It's a fact of how Facebook operates.  There is a ton of information online about how their algorithms work.  It's hardly a secret.  It kills your credibility to doubt they do it when it's full acknowledged by Facebook themselves.  I'm perfectly happy for folks who want to put themselves out there but I don't feel like putting up with ads and having my likeness used to convince my friends and family to buy things.  http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/08/how-much-should-you-know-about-how-facebook-works/378812/  http://www.businessinsider.com/how-the-facebook-news-feed-works-2014-2  http://www.valuewalk.com/2014/11/facebook-works-motivate-election-turnout-results/  ...
Treasure Island?  Taken pics there many times over the years.  Usually I go on the west side of the gate facing the city and hope for a moment alone.  Doesn't always work out though.  This was from visiting family before we moved to MD in 2013 (the Ram).  [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/O4hH52f.jpg)
The RS 1.0 has a body kit, lowering springs and an axleback exhaust (i.e. different muffler).  There are some other minor interior appearance things but really, that's about it.  The engine and transmission are identical to every other FR-S/BRZ.
Well my theory originally was to run the LWCP until I could afford a nice clutch/LWFW and tearing into the transmission.  However just recently a member started a survey thread about running both pulley and flywheel and there are plenty of folks who do without problem.  It's likely a combination of other mods like FI contributed to the problem, as well as being a holdover from other Subie engines (where it really was a bad thing to do).  http://www.ft86club.com/forums/poll.php?do=showresults pollid=956

I think you have misperceived the intent of my comments, but that's ok.  There was never an implication of joking.  In fact, I'm not even disagreeing with you, or taking this seriously as you seem to be.

Ok, OP, so you asked for advice on how to achieve in a career and you got a few folks bragging about their salaries.  Sorry about that.  I won't do the same.  I'm not in software but the general principles are the same.  Perform well at every level and go outside your required duties.  Take extra tasking on that would not typically be expected of you.  Let people know you're interested in new and different opportunities, even if they may seem outside your area of expertise.  Maintain networks of folks you've done work for - you never know when you might need or benefit from a reference.  Take training opportunities that come your way.  Make yourself invaluable.  Learn things that are new and exciting, or old and fading away.  Things that are out there in the world need to be maintained, just as much as the new things need to be created.  Strive to do better on every assignment then you did on the last.  If something's due on a particular date, get it done early.  Anyway, that's what I have for now.
Was watching with my girlfriend aboard NAS Pax River...Saw a bright red flash that lasted about 10 seconds then nothing.  Caught up with the live stream on UStream.tv to find out what happened and saw about the explosion.  One of my coworkers watched from a boat out on the Bay and forwarded some pictures as well.  Pretty crazy; an unfortunate setback for commercial spaceflight.
Ah ah ah, spoilers sweetie.
Oh and it's "Allons-Y", aka "Let's go!"
A non gender specific pronoun would be something like "they"...not partner.  But I get your point.  My point is simply, don't expect to get away with that for long as people notice it taking an effort to maintain.  Intelligent people, anyway.
There's a stock DPI version as well with 1.0.1  http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=56028380 postcount=129
Might be available eventually, or reps, but they only just announced the thing in the past twoish weeks...
34...Male...Closest representation to my belief system is libertarian, which is barely second string in the US, and that doesn't really cut it.  I'm for: guns, marriage equality, choice (abortion), vehicle modifications, motorcycle lane sharing, reduced law enforcement, separation of church and state, preventing religious organizations from free use of public facilities, preventing religious organizations from operating tax free, preventing businesses from offshoring their tax burdens, against unions, against vehicle mileage taxes...Those are probably the things I care most about
Insurance didn't care whether I had a lease or financing.  They asked "Are you leasing or financing?"  I said yes.  Simple as that.  They only care from the perspective of to whom the policy pays out.  Also, I have no requirement to have my maintenance done at a dealer.  Pretty sure they can't legally force you to do that, even on a lease.  Now, Scion Service Boost gives you maintenance for 22,500 miles (basically, first three oil changes) - maybe that's where you're confused?  I'm in the US as well - things don't vary THAT much on a state by state basis.
Well there was an update today.  Dunno if that'd make a difference for you.  November doesn't really matter though seeing as the G3 only came out in July...  I also rarely text because it drives me nuts.  So I don't know if you're one of the text fiends like most kids these days but I can't frakkin' stand texting.  What takes thirty minutes via text would take 30 seconds on a phone call.
Are you kidding me with this nonsense?  Even without a muffler, the car is below limits.  My stock CBR1000RR motorcycle is louder.  Many cars come without spares.  Our Hyundai Sonata, for example, came with a flat repair kit.  So does the Porsche Boxster, Cayman, Corvette, Chevrolet SS...I carry a 2 lb flat repair kit I chose based on Amazon reviews, and roadside assistance coverage, which comes with the car if you weren't aware.  http://www.scion.com/promotions/serviceboost/  Also, do you really think someone you force to ride in the backseat of your FRS will still be your friend once they get out of the car?  I would never put an adult back there.  We have other vehicles when we  want people to ride places with us.  The rest of the time. the blonde in my  passenger seat is the only "friend" I need.  I don't autoX so if that's what you'd rather spend your money on, more power to  you, but don't insult my choices just because they're different than your own.
