As of right now there is nothing much that linux could offer me. My pc is stable as it is and i am comfortable. I also have an old laptop running crunchbang (ubuntu before this) and a few pi with raspbian that I use as an easy information board system.   I think the moment i just rather stay with windows was a few years back when I have am optimus based laptop and there was a problem with linux using the nvidia gpu and it always will use the Intel gpu instead no matter what I did

I just realised your edit. Sorry mang :/
Started following F1 when it was held in Malaysia in 99. While technically the internet exist, it's still in it's infancy and you have to go to a cybercafe to use it, which is costly to me.   Thankfully every Sunday there is a cars special slip out section in our newspapers, and Mobil One sponsors a 10 page F1 spreadout in  it. So I collected that. And since Mobil One sponsors McLaren, it also has special features on Mika and DC  I remember watching races delayed, and I would turn off all radio and TV news before watching them.
Imagine if he debuts with the Big Show's music  Wellll!! Well it's the Big Joe! It's the Big Bad Joe toniiight!~
It's because they used her for the whole taping session, which is why she seems to be on every episode.   And you she needs the exposure. You don't become good from just hiding behind the scene. She might not be good now. but in time with enough experience she would
24 hour race car, which I think is a LMP1 car for all intent and purposes. Lego took some liberty I think. But I like it due to I can modify it with my own remote control and lego engine with minimal change.   The generic F1 car model is awesome due to the pushrod suspension, something that actually worked well and made it easy for me to explain how F1 suspension works to other people
Pretty okay match. I mean it was a spot fest in a mark town, so props to that. But the match did nothing in showing Reigns wrestling ability. It only shows he can take bumps. The tag team match was a whole lot more entertaining than this match in terms of wrestling move and in ring skills.  Interestingly I was more entertained by the Big Show's attitude.
I don't agree to an extent. What's the best flowing track on the calendar? Hungaroring. The drivers love it because once you're in the groove, it's like riding a roller coaster driving there. But we all know how hard it is to overtake there.   While a circuit should be blamed, some of the problem also lies with the cars themselves. The dirty air syndrome was always something the FIA had tried to get rid of, every time they introduce a new rule. But every time they do, engineers find a way to gain more downforce in areas they could, which in turn, introduce back this problem. The rulings for 2009 for example was introduced due to this as well as various ruling there after, but almost always, the teams manage to churn out a car that still has this problem.  Combined that with Pirelli tyres that does not last that much (because oh, people want to see tyres that does not last) you have team that err on the side of caution and instruct the drivers to drive within a certain constraint.
I just realised that after you mentioned it and went back to see my pics  http://i.imgur.com/sDmRs57.jpg  You're right, can't seem to see it here
Helps that he's charismatic as hell and I was surprised to know that NXT is his first wrestling stint. He looks so comfortable in the ring and with the crowd
I honestly think it was actually a segment meant to get Reigns over, but Heyman, being Heyman, well maybe he feels that he would give his 2 cents, in a non direct kind of way  I do honestly feel he was being sarcastic. When he went to the ring, he looks visibly scared of DBry, but he was not so of Reigns. Why would you be scared of a guy that had lost to the person that you're going to meet?

caterham and Merc certainly won't be too popular during the Chinese GP   Due to the sad case of the missing flight MH370, where the majority of the passengers were Chinese, some of the Chinese citizen has taken among themselves to blame everything that has happened on the Malaysian Govt.  With Caterham lead by Tony Fernandes that has ties with MAS (Air Asia and MAS swapped some stocks) and Merc is sponsored by Petronas which always proud of it's Malaysian root,they certainly won't be too popular in China during the GP weekend
Team balancing needs to be made smarter   The built in team balancing options for servers right now is quite basic, and once it detects that one team has a number of more players, it will take the first person that has been killed on the other side and bring it to the unbalanced side.   This, while is logical sometimes can be infuriating, moreso in RUSH and OB. Three times in Rush, I died after arming an MCOM to see I was moved to the other side. There was an ironic moment when I died arming the last MCOM with the ticket count is less than 10, and I was moved to the other side to see my arm lead the other side to victory, while I was given a lost, even tho I was the one that armed that last MCOM.  For me, this is what I think should be done for team balancing  - No player movement should happen in RUSH once the tickets are are low enough (15 or less) - Players who died PTFO (capping, arming a bomb or MCOM) should not be moved - Players that has a high number of captures/MCOM arming or defending or bomb arm should be given "less priority" to be moved  Feel free to add your idea, or fix mine
