People make the argument that it is okay that the information was leaked because swingers/poly peoples' SOs already know the information, so it is okay. I'm sorry I misunderstood your post. I'm not upset, nor was I was trying to "shit on" your post; quite the opposite. I was trying to have a conversation around the issue because I don't understand why Reddit (I'm basing that on the number or front page posts celebrating this hack) is so happy about this hack.
1- because this is a message board whee people converse 2- because it is hard to tell if your comment was a joke because that same logic has been used to justify the hack
And if the boss isn't an asshole? Do you see my point? People deserve privacy- even cheating assholes. I have a lot of swinger friends, and they keep it a secret because people are shitty and say shitty things like, "oh he/she must suck in bed, so that's why they have an open/swinging relationship". Having people find out about other peoples' private affairs, moral or immoral, is an inappropriate breach of privacy.
And how will you know if your asshole boss is cheating or if he's a swinger/poly?

Ahhh, I see. Thanks!
I tried looking this place up, but I only saw a short 4 mile loop. Is that what you're doing? Or is there more there. I ask because I live in Sacramento and am always looking for trails to ride :)  I've done American River, Sacramento River, Santa Rosa area, a lot in SF, and in Davis.
