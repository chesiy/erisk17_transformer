because it included many amendments. Of course, Congress does this a lot to many bills.   http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/what-do-highways-have-to-do-with-planned-parenthood-and-obamacare-120440.html
Baker signs $38B budget
Lincoln is a good replacement for Hillary's spectrum of voters, who don't want to support her, but indirectly helps Sanders to rise in the polls because the moderate wing is split.   Jim Webb is for those truely Conservative Democrats, which cmon... is like a nearly extinct species in the Democratic Party. DINOs! LOL  Sanders just needs to worry about O'Malley splitting his votes or hope Chafee vs Clinton gets intense for him to continue to rise.
I am not sure, if you can tell, who actually needs it the most economically, since anybody can respond saying that they need it and write up life experiences. Either way, it is your call on the pick. haha  I could talk my about my interest for it and write an essay long reasons of why I would deserve it for reasons a,b,c,d, etc. But I want to say that I am a normal yugioh player. I do have cards, of course who wouldn't with all those commons/rares/and the occasional super from the packs. I have a roid deck from when I was younger, cyber, and batteryman deck, so it is not really "meta" per say nor beginner "starter" deck. This is my first 6 ish months of attending locals and I would say that it is a great way to meet new people, have a good time, trade with others, and duel others for enjoyment. It is a great experience, since I couldn't really play casually yugioh with old long time friends, who got away from yugioh with their own niche/interests, etc.  Anyways, you are a great person, who is willing to help other members of the yugioh community. Thanks for your support! (Flattering the person lol)
High-Density doesn't really occur until you have the population density and budget to maintain it. Business Growth will reach max demand when you have over 100k people with a good mayor rating with many services and high traffic congestion. The biggest problem is high commute time and lack of jobs when you are in high density mode. It becomes a problem because people abandon your city and causes a recession. Your industrial areas need to be in manufacturing + hightech mode as well.
Ultra Rare Expressroids - This  Jetroid/Decoyroid/Gyroids maybe your best commons to pick up, since they are wind roid monsters, which matches the theme of speedroids.  Also, any generic anti-synchro cards or generic synchro support cards like tuners, synchrons, synchro monsters like Stardust Dragon, Plant synchros, synchro spells. synchro traps, etc because Konami will probably want the card game to coincide with the Arc-V storyline, where the characters are in the synchro dimension.   The set won't be out until October, so you still have over the summer to pick up the stuff.
RMT: Should I use an extra transfer? $0.4 million in bank and looking to maybe build some value?
Free-Trade is always good for America says most intelligent economists. Even if 5 chapters is  about trade, Lower Prices for Consumer means that overall welfare has increased. Trade is done in a comparative advantage way, which will boost more GDP. Do people really want tariffs everywhere?  Outsourcing and Automation is good for society, so we can focus on other industries.
Nelson Rockefeller (the moderate Rockefeller Republicans were booed by the Goldwater Conservatives in the 1964 GOP National Convention), Dwight Eisenhower (desegregated the Southern Schools from Conservative Dixicrats + continued the New Deal + warned about the military industrial complex), Richard Nixon (who enacted the EPA and basically was Keynesian in economics), Teddy Roosevelt (one of the leaders of the progressive movement), and Abraham Lincoln (freed the slaves and opposed the States Rights Movement + Supported the idea of the federal government assistance in building railroads) would be shocked at how conservative and southern/rural the Republican Party currently is.   Also, Bob Dole stated, "I thought I was a conservative, but weve got some in Congress now who are so far right theyre about to fall out of the Capitol."  http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/04/23/bob-dole-says-the-republican-party-is-way-more-conservative-than-it-was-even-20-years-ago-hes-right/
Yep. :D
Firebirds is an amazing name
Nico's voice is fine, if you have watched Yugioh GX. Zuzu's voice is what I would expect. Personally, I wished Yuya's voice was similar to that of Jaden, since at the moment, it does sound a bit annoying, but I can get used to it. Gong is what throws me off. Like....Texan Voice? LOL
Ya. I am taking economics right now in college, so I might not be a complete expert on this topic, bur I do enjoy learning about it. If I faced off against a person with "supply side-centric", I will probably lose. However, economics is a "dismal science" as noted in the economics subreddit and it really just depends on your opinions.
It may be true in a way, but I only stated this because people have been saying that protectionism never works at all, even though it had for decades before the Great Depression.
I wouldn't recommend getting Powers since Colorado's attack isn't that great. Forwards must score if Powers wants to get assists. Then, again, if you have Colorado Players already on your team from past, keep them there because you will never know what the future will hold and you have double the chances.
Thanks for the help! :D I didn't know how to do that as well.
The minimum wage is still a price floor though. You could raise it to $15 min wage and reduce the labor supply and it wouldn't really create a lot of deadweight loss of the demand is inelastic. demand for labor is inelastic when businesses have to take the market wage and can't automate as quickly.
Driving in the United States has a very inelastic demand, so when prices increase by a certain %, the reduction in demand % falls less relative to the price % increase because most Americans live in areas without good public transit nor have jobs within walking distance. Hence, why people are so concerned when prices increase because it affects them a lot and can't change it. Some might get discouraged to drive as result of the gas prices increase. Those people will take public transit, which in turn increases ridership revenues via fares. Fare Increases in the MBTA to pay for the system itself would discourage and reduce ridership because city people can take taxis, walk to their jobs, carpool, buy a care, take UBER, etc. Most economists agree that raising the gas tax can be a very efficient policy.    In Europe or other developed countries, Gas Prices are currently in many places 50% more or even double than our gas prices via very high gas taxes. Their roads and mass transit are better than ours.
Batteryman. Easy to OTK lol
Because the Bay Area is one of the largest metro areas in the US. They can support 2 teams. California could potentially have 6 MLS teams, if people, who say it should be based on metro areas instead of states, get their way.
Yes. it will take amending the Constitution, but it should be a good thing. There is way too many Americans for just 2 major political parties. Also, we need to make sure that the greens, libertarians, centrists, socialists, and fringes of ideologies are heard to keep in check in the powers of the establishment.
Max Urruti was my fav for this season during the pre-season, since he trailed BWP in goals per 90 minutes last season, but he is on the bench.   If I had to list potential candidates, it would be:  Blas Perez, Urruti, Altidore, and Rivero at the moment. Still too early in the season to call.
I just transfered one player because 1st days are always unexpected. Eric Hurtado for Jose Villareal with some spare millions.  I just hope the ones that I got before Week 1 actually perform in Week 2. Otherwise, I will have 3 transfers to build up.
roids!
Should the MBTA be privatized or not? Why?   Recently, the T has had a lot of infrastructure problems from the storm, which caused a lot of people to complain about it. However, the real problem is a money and the lack of investment in the system for years. Would Privatizing it help? Should the T get more funding? Should the T cut waste? What should be done?
Get the Box early, if you know that you really want the cards for the archtype. Do note that after supply increases, the prices of single cards will drop until the demand, which is the metagame, favors Nekroz. Then, prices will start to increase faster than supply. If not, the prices will fall to its minimum.
You will make a profit, if you resell. :)
Keep the Shift. Strategy makes the game interesting because the defense is not stagnant in the same positions.   If MLB wanted more runs and offense, Put the DH in the National League. An average MLB pitcher is almost 85%+ a guaranteed out. They are worse than the worst actual batter in any lineup.  If you want drastic changes to rules to boost offense, How about don't count all fouls as strikes? Why 2 strikes and a foul = nothing happens, yet first 2 fouls = strikes? Why not have all fouls = strikes to speed up the game?
True. I just don't want Obama to be labeled as "anti-energy" when he clearly isn't. Also, signing Keystone prevents Conservatives from blaming him for rising gas prices, if they were to rise. Also, I don't think many rural conservative voters understand the hazards of the Pipeline. I say let them deal with environmental hazards, if they leak. Though....Congress could just sign Keystone by bypassing Obama's veto and take all the blame, if environmental damages were to occur.
Ya. Though, for American Football, you can place a stadium anywhere and people will still go because it is only a weekly event. Plus, it is very inelastic in demand and supply due to low amount of games for millions of fans with limited seats.
It was part of the Stimulus, if you didn't read the news back in 2009 to 2010 or looked into it.   Here is how it was spent:  http://projects.nytimes.com/44th_president/stimulus?ref=economicstimulus  The infrastructure spending within the Stimulus is just minor patch to a major problem. Of course, we can't fix every problem, but less than 100 billion to fix a 3.6 trillion dollar problem isn't enough.
