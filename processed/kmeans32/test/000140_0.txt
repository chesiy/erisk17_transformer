Not sure why you are being downvoted. The problem is that people are super picky about where they want to live. The peninsula south of SF still has quite a bit of affordable locations. Shit, even MV has apartment complexes with 1br at $2500/month which is peanuts in the area. I'm living close to Palo Alto and my rent/utilities comes out to be $22-2300/month. The combined income of me and my partner is $90k. We are able to put away a little bit of money every month, aren't living paycheck to paycheck, and we can't eat all the groceries we buy in a week either!  I think some people just have some really strange ideas of what a "middle class" and comfortable lifestyle is. Perhaps it's a problem of people moving to the area when they're too young, making more money than they can imagine, blowing it all on eating out and partying, and then complaining that they don't have a sustainable income.  A childless couple on $150k/year in the SF Bay could easily save up/invest for a downpayment for a house or even for retirement.
I would argue the opposite about Dany and Cersei. It's been shown time and time again (at least in the shows) that she is way too naive and idealistic to know how to actually rule over people, yet alone take care of her dragons. "I'll free the slaves and everything will fall into place!" Perhaps it's also Emilia Clarke's terrible acting chops, but she is also portrayed in the television series as a petulant and stubborn teenager who constantly has to admit that her inner circle was right all along.  In Cersei's case, her thirst for power and control leads her to do batshit insane things that blow up in her face in the books. All because is an alcoholic who is paranoid about losing the only thing that gives her agency in the world: being able to manipulate and control her children.  In Sansa's case, why would you expect her to become stronger? She has not shown much indication of being particularly bright (unlike Arya).  One message that I think the show is trying to get across is that there are power structures that are out of everyone's control, no matter how hard they try to get out.
Don't do that, unless you want to get an opportunistic skin infection.  Maybe a better idea: somehow get a of sweat from someone who doesn't smell that bad (eg. give them a towel after they exercise), and squeeze it under your armpits.
Dont we take care of our own? Not really, not unless you come from money. In poor families you become a nurse if you want to aspire to a better life.  Now she's just ranting.  Sounds like entitlement to me, and also sounds like someone who uses her "socio-economic status" to justify her entitlement. You can be financially poor, but if you are at OHSU of all places for medical school then you sure as shit aren't in the same galaxy when it comes to hierarchy in society.
That really depends on a lot of factors. Because $35k/y is a pretty comfortable lifestyle, literally everything you make from whatever career you choose will be pure profit. I don't think most people who have that kind of funds sit around and do nothing. My guess is they would try to find new and unconventional ways to have more income because they wouldn't be bound by risk.
If they were all about good intentions then all they would have needed to do is implement a version of the "dead man switch". You have to come back after winding it up for X minutes. If you don't your car gets towed. The switch gets reset when the car leaves so you can't wind it up forever and leave it for the next person.
I thought seasons 3-5 were the best ones. Season 3 was when it started to turn into a real spy drama with a large overarching plot, and 4-5 got quite good. I started watching from the first episode and was pretty happy that it matured into a pretty cool show. All things considered, the finale was pretty much the best that anyone could ask for. Most shows don't even attempt to wrap anything up.
Not to mention the USSR was driven largely in part by "extracted resources" from satellite states and the resulting trade with them. Things like food and raw materials. Russia has none of that, doesn't have a great manufacturing sector, and is frozen out of capital markets from international sanctions.   Wars are expensive. Invading Crimea was the dumbest thing Putin has ever done. It gave the West a reason to put the classic economic stranglehold on them. Putin was also too stupid and lacked the foresight to see US fracking disrupting the oil market, which with the invasion gave the Saudis two reasons to really fuck with the oil prices.
When I fall asleep (even naps) I start dreaming in seconds. I get uncontrollably tired during the day, but only if I'm unstimulated. Does that sound like narcolepsy?  In college and grad school I also fell asleep in almost every single class, and I would have desperate urges to lay down (in public!!) and fall asleep when I was out and about on campus.
I do NGS all the time in the lab -- there's really not that much difference between kits when you're sequencing exomes at 100x to account for false discovery rates. You're going to pretty much hit everything. The problem with the SureSelect kits are that they cost a ton of money. Illumina has a nice "Rapid Capture Exome" SKU that lets you do a multiplexed exome capture if you BYO Illumina multiplexed library for $300/capture and just use the Nextera enzyme for another experiment.  Also when you're looking at diseases with a very strong phenotype, most likely it is exonic and that should be the first line diagnostic before you do WGS because you will otherwise get too many false hits.  If you want to take it a step further, doing trio exome/WG sequencing for an affected person can really help you narrow down a mutation, regardless of whether it is inherited (by following pedigrees) or spontaneous (novel mutaiton not found in either parent).
Don't worry, that won't happen. China knows they are walking a very fine line. As soon as there is violent suppression of the protests they will lose all legitimacy on the island and it will spiral out of control. Contrary to what everyone else sees, China only has tenuous control of the entire country so long as economic conditions are growing. That's why they are so worried about a slowdown in growth (even if it's at 7%!!! this year).   In Hong Kong, you have 90% of the population that is essentially nativist/"nationalist" against outside influence. The only reason why China hasn't seen more resistance is because they agreed to the "don't fuck with us and we won't riot" treaty in 1997. If this escalates to violence, you can't stop 6+ million people from throwing out the government. Once this starts, you know that other large cities will start to push back.  Also keep in mind that by and large HK is much more affluent than the rest of China. They aren't bound by the same economic social contract. They are genuinely concerned for their rights, as opposed to many mainland Chinese who will put up with a lot of oppression for economic growth.  Source: I'm a HKer.
PROTIP: If you see anything that says "MSG free", but has "hydrolyzed yeast", hydrolyzed protein, or "amino acid salts" on the ingredient list.... that's MSG! Tons of people happily buy this and think they're getting a "healthier" meal.
What you are basically saying and other admins on reddit have said are that the only types of content that will ever be removed from reddit are (a) ones that violate copyright, (b) child pornography, and (c) personally identifiable information. Everything else is a total free-for-all.  This is the disconnect that you have with large swaths of the reddit community. Not only are those three categories occupy such a narrow range of topics, but yishan's earlier post suggests that the discussion is more or less closed on how reddit censors content. Also, these three categories are also conveniently ones that will get you in trouble with litigation or law enforcement, which makes it seem like a total CYA move.  Please, try to understand this perspective from the community's point of view. If you are going to actively censor content, you have to do it in a less tone-deaf fashion.
I think this is a common trend as you get older. As a guy, I don't understand why women feel the need to cover themselves with makeup and fancy clothes every single day. My girlfriend doesn't wear any and dresses in jeans and a tshirt, and the fact that she's comfortable makes her positively radiant.
The sad part is that there is simply too many people for "low density" farming to feed unless you turned the entire planet into farmland. Intensive industrial farming is just objectively more efficient. Bourlag's Green Revolution saved billions of people simply because farming techniques became modernized. I don't think people really understand that when at the mercy of the weather/climate, entire societies regularly starved to death. Look at North Korea now, and Eastern Europe not even that long ago.
Holy shit.
I don't blame him -- getting conned makes you lose your trust in the field and can shake you pretty hard. At least he didn't commit suicide like the guy at RIKEN. He probably had a lot of academics throw shit at him as the witch hunt got pretty disgusting at times. I wouldn't be surprised if he had a "fuck this shit, not worth it" moment.
I think the main problem is that the technology's not really there yet. Unlike cancer, there's not a huge foundation of biomarkers and proposed mechanisms to build on. The ones that we do have, though, are somewhat inconclusive/have low effect size/not completely predictive. Today, at least with cancer you could sequence and find mutations that could be clinically actionable. I think the best thing we can do is try a similar approach, but instead of looking for mutations we could look at gene expression changes that could be druggable.
I went to Harvard as a PhD student and this was always confusing to me. I knew a few people that ended up getting Masters degrees from the Extension school, and also plenty of people that ended up getting certificates or taking post-bac pre-med classes. As far as I know, for the degree programs you were still enrolled under the Extension School (which is part of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences), so it's unclear whether you would be sharing classes with the rest of the undergrad community. You could join all the extracurriculars and community events, though. Finally, you were also strictly prohibited from listing your degree as from "Harvard University" and had to list it as "Harvard Extension School", although I know literally nobody that actually followed this rule on their resume.
I'd give them a bit more credit. The Transformers movies have been getting better with each sequel. I think the writers and even Bay himself have been getting comfortable with making this type of movie. There are very few decent movies that exist today where the main characters are *not* the humans. Godzilla was terrible (despite a lot of redditors loving it, for some reason), and Pacific Rim just barely got the right balance. The Hollywood track record actually isn't very good.
The only problem is that seeding guts with genetically modified bacteria has never been done and is probably going to have a hard time at the FDA. Theoretically you could functionally cure type I diabetes by engineering E. coli to express recombinant insulin with specific molecular triggers (eg. some kind of sugar alcohol or drug inducer) and have it live in the gut. Many types of insulin on the market today are recombinant, so it's not a matter of capability -- it's a matter of the FDA flipping its shit when you produce a "living medicine".
For sure! I was in a pretty tough program in undergrad, and we always had group homework sessions. It's a waste of time to do homework by yourself when you can ask your peers/TAs for help. Most professors are very supportive of this because it encourages collaborative learning, but keep in mind that working together could easily lead to copying assignments -- and most students succumb to the latter even with the best intentions. It will bite them in the ass eventually but they do it anyway.
IMO, it wasn't even worth the $8.50 student discount price that I paid. Godzilla was on the screen for maybe 15 minutes, and the other monsters just flew around and didn't do shit. Not to mention the huge plot-holes. I could forgive all that if there were lots of monster-Godzilla fights, but most of the time it just cut away to another scene! Especially during the Hawaii scene when they first start fighting! WTF was that? It just cut to the next day and the MUTO had ran off with no explanation!  Pacific Rim I could forgive, because it was exactly what I expected. Godzilla had no plot and no action.
Your friend is missing a crucial point though -- you can't make blanket statements about medicines, since their mechanisms of action are so disparate. You have salicylic acid and artemesinin, two plant-derived drugs that are first-line use, but you also have a ton of other plant-derived molecules that can't be used in people without significant modification. These kinds of generalized statements about drugs and medicines are unfortunately convenient because they don't require much critical thought, but the fact is that you have to look at everything on a case by case basis.   Add onto that the **type of knowledge** that we have is very different today then it was back then. There's still a lot to be discovered and a lot of uncertainty, but it is not in the same areas as 50-400 years ago. We are capable of more critical thinking today than in the entire history of civilization, so it's not useful at all to generalize.
The whole argument for armed guards everywhere is completely ridiculous. The fact is that the USA is one of the safest places in the world to live. It's the media that's inflating the fear of violent death. Violent crime is typically concentrated in bad neighborhoods and ghettos, where the police are reluctant to do anything useful (for various reasons I won't get into here). Violence also is particularly pronounced for certain ethnic groups. If politicians and the police force were actually serious about saving lives, they would actually direct resources to areas where they would have an impact instead of making a big show out of it.
I used to own an LG Voyager and my gf still uses and env2. Those things are tanks. I complain all the time about how my smartphone is now so laggy, but those things just power through with no lag. Very responsive. Even the shitty web browser didn't freeze half the time on a webpage, which was great for briefly reading the news. I miss those days when you didn't have to wait for anything on a phone.
Look at that quote: "According to the new data, the last confirmed communication between the plane and the satellite was at 8.11am (Malay time) Saturday 8th March." That thing was in the air for a *long time*. AFAIK, it might have still been communicating with the satellite when it was supposed to land in Beijing! AFAIK the transponder signal was flipped off at ~1-2am, which means this thing was in the air for a solid 6 hours without anyone noticing.
What about used lab equipment on places like LabX or laboratory surplus stores?
I'm a Canadian living in the USA for the past 8 years.  Let's be fair here: when stratifying by ethnic groups, standards of living in Canada are by and large **much** better than the USA. It's not even a fair contest. Crime rates in Canada are downright laughable compared to the USA. It is true that jobs are segregated across racial lines but that is changing a lot as the children of immigrants get out of college, start second-generation families, and compete with white folk for top-tier jobs.
To be fair, not all of us who favor intervention are in favor of military action. There are a lot of steps to go before you send in soldiers. Fundamentally I think the notion that another country's problems are not our owns is somewhat racist. It's like saying their own problems are not worth addressing. There are non-profit programs all over the world that work in health and education and people support the development of these infrastructures, but as soon as civil strife and violence comes in everybody throws their hands up and says "not our problem" when civil society is one of the most important aspects of ensuring day-to-day stability. It's like saying that these other countries aren't "good enough" or "civilized enough" to join the world society at large.
A coffee maker is too inconvenient, and the water doesn't get hot enough to extract nice flavors. Here's an easier method:  1. https://shoponline.melitta.com/items/COFFMKRSPROVER 2. Boil water 3. 3 Tbsp of coffee 4. Pour hot water onto grounds. If you are really fancy you could pour at a constant rate like those hipsters do. I just fill it to the top because I don't care. 5. Drink. Throw away filter.
Violent reaction with superheated water!
