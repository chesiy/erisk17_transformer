what the fuck is a sonic?
It's a hell of a lot better than when Jon was on it
Spore. best one they've done
He misses an assload of cues and there were blank frames in a few episodes, the audio levels were fucked up for a while, he put up the wrong thumbnail once or twice, I'm sure there's more, these are just the ones I remember off the top of my head
If the entertainer listening to the criticisms is ultimately their own personal choice, then what's the point of your comment here even existing?   There are a lot of stupid people that don't understand the concept of criticism. This is where people labeled ventgrumps as whiners, nitpickers, etc.   There's already several posts complaining that they don't want to be downvoted if they criticize the show. Why can't they stand that other people have a different opinion? "Oh no I got downvoted! I guess everyone else is an idiot!" is the general consensus amongst people like this.   The criticizers know that the Grumps have a choice.   The criticizers don't seem to know much of anything. There was a guy on Ventgrumps shortly before it closed complaining that Game Grumps is "now a comedy show and no longer talk about game design" **that** is exactly the problem with illegitimate criticism. If you don't understand what the show is and always has been to begin with, why should you post your opinion at all? And why is it such a sin for someone to downvote your completely useless opinion?   Thus, your comment is completely useless.  I can see that it went right over *your* head, but it's not useless if it helps ONE person understand my point
He **did** grow up as kind of a spoiled rich kid, so when the time came that he actually had to commit to/work hard on something, he probably couldn't handle it. It makes sense, and he did voice his disdain for the fact that it was a JOB (which is actually a very positive thing, despite his attitude toward it) several times on the show and in the Ode to Jon video
It'll be the whole channel once the company finally reaches the stage where they can create content for other platforms that provide more financial stability.  Arin and Ross are each working on an animated series, Starbomb is already a highly profited music project, Danny is always working on NSP and Starbomb, and there will be plenty of ideas that they'll have/pursue in the future.    I foresee a Ninja Sex Party movie at some point that will bomb at the box office despite being totally rad and hilarious (like Tenacious D's movie)

"MMmm, that cake was delicious! I wish I could have some more without worrying about getting fat! OH wait! I have JUST the thing!"
look, dude, I understand it's just a joke, but I can't suspend my disbelief entirely!  **At his job?** Seriously? Jokes have to have SOME sort of basis in reality here

I'm not enjoying it. It has some funny moments here and there, but I hate when they talk about the games, which they're doing a lot of here (unless the game is interesting, which Bloodborne does not appear to be.) I was actually thinking about getting it, till they started playing it and I realized how boring and repetitive it seems  Edit: Don't forget to downvote if you disagree with me, cumfaggots :)
"Your performance in this position has been unsatisfactory and I'm afraid we'll have to let you go"   "Whatever! Come at me, SCRUB-LORD, I'm Ripped!"
"Well kids, sorry, but that's the seventh night in a row... you know what that means!"  "We have to eat the firstborn?"  "That's right... Cody, you get a 10-second head start. RUN!"    (Arin.... how do you **LIVE** with yourself!?!?)
I usually don't care, but there's only so many jokes Danny can make at the expense of Arin's failure before it gets boring. A whole episode of fuck-ups is fine, but not if it's the exact same fuck-up over and over again. Go to a different level and fuck-up there.  Plus, it's just super fucking annoying to hear Arin complain about a video-game. Ever.

You better have my money by Thursday, you got it? If it aint in my hands by then, I'm gonna hook you up with a nice job with medical benefits that pays 35 dollars an hour so you can pay off your debt!  ....trust me... you don't want it to go that far..
It's an actual project, not just a Let's Play. It takes time to produce, and they don't have a big post-production team. There's a lot of editing that needs to be done, which will be more complicated because they'll have to make sure it's coherent and actually tells a story (even if it is a Reality-Show-esque story) There seems to be a lot of live-action elements to it, and that's a lot harder to edit than game footage. There's a lot more to editing a real project than just putting clips in the correct order. Once the raw edit is done, it is immediately followed by Sound Mixing, Music, Color Correction, etc.  Each of which are difficult and time-consuming on their own.  They also have to balance this project with the other projects they're working on (some of which they probably haven't told the fans about yet)
**I'll start it off:**  "I'm having a waking nightmare,  I'm seeing colors in the sky...  Everybody wants to know about me,  but they don't know about my........  big ol' penis, flopping around,  it's three big feet of pleasure.  Put it in your mouth and put it in your vagine...  Everyone's having a real good time,  when they're hanging around my big floppy penis.  Can't quite stroke it really fast.  Covering three feet of skin with your hand isn't really easy.  Here's how fast I can jack my whole dick,  "Hah, ah, ah, ah, aaahhh."  That includes the back and forth motion,  let's do it again, "Ah aahhh."  "Ah ah ah ah ah ah aaahhhh..."  That's how fast I can jack my peen.  Everybody thinks that they have seen my penis,  but they haven't,  'cuz if they have...  they'd shit themselves.
I didn't miss it, I just felt like rectifying it. Too many people seem to think hearsay = fact
Death is coming for us all, man, woman, and child...   The Fyllid traveled 10 million light years to reach our world, to harvest the blood of the creatures they planted here long ago, in the age before recorded history. Those creatures began as simple-minded apes, but have now evolved into a society.  They'll be expecting no resistance. Let's be sure to give them one hell of a fight!  (As told by the crazy guy on the street corner with tin foil on his head)
There is an actual legal problem, it's that singing songs you don't have the rights to is copyright infringement.  http://www.songrights.com/infringe.htm  A lot of people here have a misconception about this, thinking it's something covered under fair use, but that would only work if Game Grumps was a review show (and reviewing the song in question)  While youtube's automated "third-party content" detector does suck, they can repeal false claims. But if they get flagged with proof that they infringed on someone's song sitting right square in the middle of the video, it won't go over well for them.  I know it seems unfair and I know you see it everywhere on youtube, but it is illegal to perform cover songs without permission. (And, you'd be surprised to see how many covers have been flagged and now all the ad revenue goes toward the copyright holder)
Guys! I found a site on the internet devoted ENTIRELY to beautiful naked women having sex! They call it 'porn!'    I think you'd like it if you gave it a chance
That's the most common myth people believe, but the truth is, it's infringement regardless of the amount of time.   If you are doing a video that falls under fair use (a review, a critique) then using 30 seconds is protected. Game Grumps is not a review show.  And they would also have to PROVE fair use, it's not automatically assumed.

I was gonna say something along these lines but you beat me to it
Sure thing :)
well after all the rape, of course! It's not pooping if it just falls out of you without your consent  (hint; because your asshole is widened)
and all the other ones too
Well, what I mean isn't that the other universes are created when possibilities are presented, it's that those moments are where each universe starts to veer into its own, beginning with the most miniscule of differences. There wouldn't be an original 'you' just a different one.  A question I just thought of, though...  In an infinite universe, where mathematically speaking, anything that is possible or thinkable can and will eventually happen, then wouldn't THAT be in a way, predestination/fate?
Thinking of Writing a Stand-Up routine for atheists...   I used to do stand-up but stopped doing it to pursue filmmaking/improvised comedy. Recently, some new opportunities have arisen that may require me to do some stand-up on the side. I wanna talk about subjects that actually interest me, and definitely subjects that haven't been done to death. I've written some jokes on Star Trek, a few on being married that send up the "married life cliches" in stand-up and sitcoms, and a few on death that lead into the concept of Hell. I'm most proud of the last ones because, not only do I think they are the funniest bits, but it's a very interesting subject that I don't think I've heard many comedians talk about. The only thing that comes to mind is George Carlin's "but he LOVES you" bit.  So, I'm wondering, what are some topics you, as an atheist, would love to hear some comedy about? You know, there's SO many things that comedians could touch on but they don't, I just want to know what the community itself wants.   edit: For reference; here are some examples of the Hell material: "... I mean, you never see a father trying to discipline his kid going "HEY! BILLY! Quit hitting your sister with the stick or I swear to Christ I will punch you in the fucking face! And I'm not JUST gonna punch you.... I'm gonna punch you...... FOREVER!!!  Also, "The belief in Hell clearly stems from these peoples' history of being abused as children as well as living in a society that recommends and accepts it. It implants warped views of justice in their minds and gives them a sense of an unavoidable cosmic malevolence.... trust me, I googled it..."
