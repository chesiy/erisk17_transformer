Wow thanks!!
I dont know much about the jacket, but I have been making props and masks for a while. If you choose to modify the mask, BUY PRIMER! specifically for plastic (I would assume the mask would be plastic) and it comes in a spray paint can. Acrylic paint would work the best because its bright, but the downside is that it chips if you dont seal it.   Now if you want to make a mask, the quickest way would be to use worbla and shape your own mask. I would recommend using a foam head that they use for wigs as a form. Worbla can be expensive, and a little tricky to work with, but it looks very professional as a final product.
Basically, my dad went out of the country (San Miguel de Allende, Mexico to Bostom, MA) for college and he HATED it. He doesn't want me to feel isolated and alone in a different state. Him not paying 50% for out of state tuition is a way to try to get me to stay in state, which I have always been adamantly protesting since my sophomore year...   I have visited MSU and I genuinely like the relaxed feel the student body has. I feel that itd would be much easier for me to graduate near the top of my class with amazing grades. But on the other hand, UNC is more prestigious but I feel as if my grades wont be up to standard.
Going in for a major is English Education and a minor is TSOL! :)   They are one of the only universities that offer TSOL as not only a major, but a minor as well so thats what really won me over.
Haha nah I'm in North Carolina!

[srs] met chloe at a cosplay convention and she is one of the nicest people ever, not gonna lie. she gave compliments and tips to all the fans she met and seemed pretty down to earth.  i do think she oversexualizes cartoon/movie/comic book characters, but hey, its cosplay.
Eyebrow game STRONG part 2
A few weeks ago I received CC that I should try to fill in my brows more and to try out a more "dewy" look. I took the advice, so what do you think?  Products used  Primer: TwoFaced Primed and Poreless  Concealer: IT Cosmetics Bye-Bye Undereye  Foundation: IT Cosmetics Celebration Foundation  Lips: Vaseline   Eyeliner: NYX liquid liner  Eyebrows: Anastasia Beverly Hills Dipbrow Pomade  Highlighting: Sally Hansen Natural Beauty Highlighter Duo
IT is well worth the price! Honestly it covers so well I dont need concealer, but you have to buff well so the foundation doesn't appear cakey.  And about Coldstone, its just the way they're run, but mine doesn't require you to sing unless someone asks :P we're lazy!   I cant believe youre a cosplayer, its do rare to find them!!! I've done Taiga Aisaka from Toradora! Yin from Darker than Black, Harley Quinn, and im working on a Poison Ivy now that I got my awesome green lipstick from Melt Cosmetics 3
Also, in Japan everyone is Japanese. I have been here as an exchange student for 5 months and the only foreigners besides my fellow classmates are the occasional tourist.
