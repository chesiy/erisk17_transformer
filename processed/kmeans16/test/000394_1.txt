She knows what she wants and it's a nintendo ds.
No, pero yo esta quiero aprender. I literally speak NO languages beside English, that is why I'm trying to just take languages into my own hands and push myself.

He's very persistent. How do I tell someone I'm not interested?
Until now, I never even thought about looking at depression books. My Christmas Give is going to be so helpful, thank you!
Nothing of importance? I thought 1984 was wrote there? That's something I guess. Plus when famous people visit the islands they tend to skip over Islay and go to Jura which annoys me because I just think 'Come to our island, Jura has like NOTHING on it!' but yeah.
I'm not sure if it changes where you are from but as long as you have a medical note from your doctor and you have been experiencing problems with it then you should 'qualify'. They can't reject you because people need to realise this is a real condition and it has real affects to daily life. Whether you are in uni or have a job or both - depression can make it a lot harder to keep up and get by.
Because I feel like I might be milking it a bit and they might think that I'm just attention seeking or something. But I'll take what I can get
Can anyone recommend any cool/unusual wee shops in Edinburgh?   I moved here not long ago and have already done the main things. Also went to the elephant house recently and stopped by a cool shop called Joe. Does anyone know any cool wee places to go? Preferably not including museums, monuments or anything like that. Also does anyone know if there are any cool themed restaurants or cafes or anything? Thank you!  Edit: Thanks to everyone who has recommended a place to go. I will definitely be trying to get to all of these the next time I'm out exploring Edinburgh City.
I am going in to get a diagnosis tomorrow and was wondering if anyone had any tips to someone who gets anxious when talking about feelings and personal issues?   I have avoided talking about personal things and my true feelings since I can remember and am really anxious about my doctor's appointment today. Just to be prepared I have printed out a PHQ and filled it in but I'm still really nervous and panicky. Any tips?  EDIT: Thanks everyone! I had my appt. and it went really well. She was straightforward, actually listened to me and then gave me a perscription and told me to use my free uni councelling service. It really helped that I braught with me the PHQ. I now have a perscription for fluoxetine.
I need absolute quiet when I'm sleeping. Thats the reason I wear headphones to bed (it's done the trick til now). Rain sounds sooth me but I can't fall asleep with them. Thanks though!
whats a white noise machine?
My flatmates watch t.v in the hall of our flat til late, talk loudly and keep me up - what is a nice way i can deal with this and not make it awkward since I have to live with them til June?   Recently my flatmates have taken to watching tv on their laptop in the hall of our flat. There are three of them and it only started happening recently. They put on youtube clips of movies, songs (and sing a long with them) and talk really loudly. Sometimes they scream and one tends to shriek a lot. Sometimes I can hear them running up and down the flat chasing eachother like children. FYI - no drinking involved. Usually I put up with it but when I have a 9am lecture (and I know that none of them are in until around 12pm) I can tell its gonna be a long night. I shouldn't have to put up with this though right? Also I have depression to getting sleep is really important. I have said to them nicely that I was trying to sleep (that was last night) and they quietened down but I'm afraid that they will be more bitchy to me if I come out and say it on a regular basis.  BUT ITS FUCKING ANNOYING! So what do I do? This is uni accomodation so I have to stay til June and can't change flats (another flatmate of ours applied ages ago because of them and was told there is none)
