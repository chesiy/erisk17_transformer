Hey guys! I don't know how AMA's are organized on here but I do have afew sugestions: Headhunterz, he made the switch from hardstyle to house a bit ago so I think people would have some questions for him. Angerfist, he had his own festival last year and he released a pretty kick ass album to go along with it. Noisecontrollers, one of the biggest names in the hardstyle scene, he has an album coming out soon and I think it would be cool to ask him afew questions
For the hard dance boys and girls!  This is terror 14 (if you like terrorcore)  Universal tranzmission (a compilation from kidd kaoses label, some great hard trance 3)  Angerfist - Retaliate (hardcore classic)  D-block and S-te-fan - Super nova (2009-2010 Hardstyle 3)  Darren Styles   Francis Hill - Come Running (rounding it off with some UK hardcore)
This guy is basically a blond version of Pat
I agree with this! Ophidian I love you

It had a lot of things that turn me off anime *cough cough* INSEST *cough cough*... But seriously one of the main things I didn't like was the tone it was just inconsistent, it goes from goofy cat girl bullshit to horrible multination with no middle ground. The part that killed it for me was was the fight scene between Lucy and that other girl they both looked ridiculous which made it even more stupid when she says "my vector has a better range then yours" which I guess sums it up right their. TO MANY FUCKING CLICHS lets see: goofy sex stuff where another character walks in on them *check* Incest *check* taking a girl home with you who you just found at the beach with no clothing on instead of taking her to the hospital *check* building up a harem *check* having one of those scenes where two characters are comparing their powers in the middle of a fight *check* naked underage girls *check*  just too many clichs  presented with a completely straight face which makes the violence hard to take seriously (it is pretty raw I will say that though) also this is kind of a minor gripe but fucking cat girls with invisible hands coming out of their backs that are basically high frequency blades...... I mean really. It's late here.... So ya fuck you elfen lied
The hypest basketball game
I love how obvious it is that Sam is doing the vocals for this one   EDIT: fantastic reverse bass, a lot of my favorite reverse bass tracks come from Bioweapon/Audiofreq
Kick making :) as you can probably tell by my flair kicks are a big part of the music I make, weather it be the over driven sound of a gabber kick, the dry dusty omf of a gated kick (gated kicks are commonly used in hard trance), the aggression of a frenchcore kick, the power of a hardstyle kick or the solid thunk of a UK hardcore kick. Theirs something about synthesizing or editing one from a sample pack that is just so relaxing and fun, plus it's so cool to hear how just a little EQing can change so much about the character of a kick
for when you burn your friends super bad. Ladies and gentlemen I present to you "Ohhh suck it.wav"
Believe it or not he actually has a hardstyle alias, sadly he's only [released one song under it](http://youtu.be/0wXZJues_bs)
Sure thing dude, I don't know of any but I'll take a look for you. Also *gives pat on back*
RULES OF NATURE!!!!
Not all hard trance is like this but most of the stuff I listen to is, some recommendations I have are Lisa lashes, Kidd Kaos, Alex Kidd, dark by design, ASYS, geck-o and the organ donors. P.S. Listen to [this](http://youtu.be/erZJu-x41hQ) it's what got me into hard trance :)
great song but not exactly what I'm looking for, come to think of it the stuff I'm looking for would probably be classified as Big Room/Main Stream house :/ any ways heres another [example](https://soundcloud.com/fiveandadime/5-a-dime-tempo-6-59-songs-in-an-hour-1) (start at 46:34) P.S. this mix actually has a lot of the kind of music I'm looking for
Sure thing :)

[Japanese stream hardcore 4 album preview](http://youtu.be/IZRvaeJUKjw) my favorite song from this album is clock control by Kobaryo, the melody is spot on   [Massive Circlez 2 cross fade demo](http://youtu.be/IZRvaeJUKjw) all the Massive Circlez compilations are gold, most Japanese producers make all kinds of hard dance but the massive new krew consistantaly make Hardstyle so check them out  As for buying these... Well most Japanese releases I've seen are physical copy only and they are only available from various Japanese websites (so unless you speak Japanese or your browser translates it for you, you might have a hard time finding out if the CD's are still in stock / if they ship outside of Japan). the Japanese stream hardcore comps. Are on iTunes as for the Massive Circlez you might have to result to torrenting. I can PM you the torrent file if need be
Thanks :)

Me too ^^^^choo^^^^choo
Need some feed back on an idea   Hello everyone! you may remember me as the guy who asked for euphoric hardstyle needed in a [mix for a school talent show](http://www.reddit.com/r/hardstyle/comments/2itn3g/a_call_to_everyone/), well here's an update. Me and my friend decided to do our own things for the talent show, it was after that I got to thinking "why just show people hardstyle when there's a whole genre of music (Hard Dance) I could expose them too". So after some work I have made a mix and a power point, I'm going to do a live mix while projecting the power point behind me. Each slide will have the genre of the current song, facts and what song is currently playing. This is where you guys come in, [heres a link to the mix](https://soundcloud.com/infernal-imp/hard-dance-lession) [and heres a link to the PP](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-dST9JfmygNvSEaYppJVyBqe36W_bYfXJMalfE6xZjU/edit?usp=sharing), I've made it so you guys can leave notes on the PP in case I got any facts wrong. Thanks in advance :)
