It's hard to put my finger on it. I think mostly it feels like I'm hearing my brother and sister fucking each other if that makes sense. Beyond that, I just have never really liked the idea of living with a couple. Especially new couples. No matter how well we get along and how well we know each other,  it's still a new relationship and things could change for the worse.    nbsp;   Also, to be completely honest, I've never felt as comfortable hanging out with the guy alone without her there to facilitate the conversation so, meh.
Oh wow this is a great one :)
That sounds amazing! Let's do it :)
I can give you the bird; that one I still have! I stupidly cleaned off the spilling because I was being hard on myself and ended up making it have an orange background.. You are welcome to have it anyway, though. Other than that I can make you a cat if you'd prefer! I gifted the fat cat to an old room mate for holding onto a sentimental piece of furniture that I sold years back but I love drawing cats and am always happy to do more :)
Oh my god!!! I love this, haha. He looks so beaten down by life.   *"I don't know, man... I've... I've seen some shit."*   Thank you so much!
Thank you! :)
Ha, well based on everyone elses response, it seems like I'm not the only one. But, you know, it's cool if you feel that way.

This is in Boston. Everything is expensive and nothing makes sense.
Thank you so much! This is incredibly helpful! I've tried quite a few, but honestly ony can remember about one or two from most categories as I wasn't drinking them with the intention of selling it, heh. I really appreciate the feedback and will keep it in mind until I have my own go-to's as ammunition :)
Just made a ton of flash cards and have been taking notes and making sure I'm pronouncing things right (like Cynar for example).   As far as customer service goes, I have that in the bag and I know I'll kill it in that department; I just need to make sure I don't fuck up my drinks!  I am going into the bar before they open today to do a little practice. I'll report back after. Thanks a bunch!
Great job!
Seriously, you have helped me get through SO many shitty days at my horrible job. I put a post-it on my desk that says "You didn't get mauled by a bear. You can get through this day!!!"  As much as that sounds like a back handed compliment, I read your whole thread and your attitude and just overall sense of fight has seriously been such an incredible inspiration. Thanks for coming back to check in!!! :D
Haha no offense taken. I was greasy and awkward... It was also taken in a shitty mall photo booth with my best friend at the time... It had a banner that said **ANGEL'S** or something pathetic like that, too. I'd probably be offended if I still looked like that, haha...
Hey! You're one of the few girls that can be compared to a hippo without it actually being an insult (perhaps)...  Hippopotamus also sweat red! Their sweat is much more viscous and works as a natural sunblock. Maybe you're just more evolutionarily advanced!   http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/3749351.stm
