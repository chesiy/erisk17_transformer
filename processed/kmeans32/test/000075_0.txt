To combat sectarianism like this, go to Iftar this Ramadan to a mosque of which you are not the majority denominations and post pictures on social media with the hashtag. #IStandWithMyShiaCommunity, or #IStandWithMySunniCommunity and tag your friends.
You're projecting your thoughts into my head. My ideal solution is one single state where Jews, Christians and Muslims are living wherever they want and worshipping freely. If you call the death of a Jewish-only state as genocide, then you are deluded.   The terrorists, the ISIS types, the ones who actually wish a military destruction of Israel would fight against "pro-Palestinians" if Israel is out of the way. They give Israel's military a justification, and most of us don't like that. It's why we have our own organizations and don't work with them.   I want what happened to South Africa to happen to Israel. Last I heard, when the apartheid there ended, there wasn't some genocide of white South Africans. Now, prejudices there still remain, but people there aren't subject to discrimination and massive human rights violations.
HUGE chemical plant fire in Hanover this morning.
Who is preaching about a dragon queen...Wait, I have a theory.  [Lord of Light theory](#g "Based on the preaching of the priestess in Volantis, I think the dragon queen is an integral part of their faith, and that Melisandre is eventually going to sell out Stannis in favor of Daenerys, either by the end of this season or after Stannis possibly becomes King.")
I live closer to the Amish than you do, lol. We probably live in the same state. I consider myself practicing, and no, it is not a sin to talk to you. Many Muslim women who cover wear jeans, actually most of of the young Muslim women I've met in the states wear jeans.   Women aren't required to have a man escorting them everywhere. In some of the more conservative Muslim countries,  sure, that rule is there and it is misguided, but the lack of education of many there makes it a safety issue for women.   I've been to Iran, Pakistan, Iraq (mid 1990s), Syria, the West Bank, Egypt, Dubai and Jordan, and I've seen women walking around all the time on their own without a male guardian. My mother and sister got to work every day on their own and both wear the hijab.  We use modern technology,  unlike the Amish, and we tend to wear all types of clothing, unlike them.
Cruz: Universities that boycott Israel should lose federal funding
I just posted an open-ended fresh question in a fresh post. I must confess, I've been in this sub before, and this is most abrasive reaction that I've ever gotten.
I guess you can waddle back to BCND and tell everyone how P S disregarded the article because of the source.  Can you honestly tell me how that is helpful to any discussion? What's done is done now. It seems you're having a bad day, and I'm sorry if this article was just the straw that broke the camel's back. What do you think about the article? Is it unfairly prosecuting? Does the officer in question have a compelling story or does something not add up? Please, I mean no offense.

Soony Saad and Justin Meram are from Michigan. Both are pros, both are Arab-American and both play for Lebanon and Iraq respectively.
And now you're claiming America's soccer games can't be good! You monster! /s  You have to understand, we American fans are a bit sensitive to criticism from people who look down on MLS and other soccer played in North America. Our league is a lot better than what people who don't watch and/or live overseas give it credit for.
If you can get CM Punk to a Chicago Fire game, that would be a match made in heaven.   The Union = one or more ECW and/or ROH stars.   Seattle = Daniel Bryan.   Portland = Don't know any wrestlers from Oregon. Maybe Roman Reigns just to troll.   NYCFC = Zack Ryder!   DC United = Batista  Columbus = Dolph Ziggler or The Miz.   RBNY = AJ Lee is from Jersey.   Toronto = Edge/Christian.   Montreal = Kevin Owens/Sami Zayn.   I'm sure there are plenty for other states, but off the top of my head, I'm out.

Yeah, I read about it in that article by Brian Sciaretta the other week. Sure, the Armenian league isn't all that great, but if Ibarra can get called up, Romero should too. Mexico also has to be noticing his play at this point as media attention increases.
I always thought a good gimmick would for someone to buy into his philosophy, start Bo-lieving and then suddenly win their matches with Bo's help. Someone like Zack Ryder would be perfect. He could wear a white suit, have a combed haircut and start spouting off how terrible he was before he met Bo and started bolieving. They could do that victory lap holding each other's arms high.   **EDIT:** Suit not suite. He can't wear a nice hotel room. It's also spelled "bo-lieve."
Flair up while you're at it!
Nice backpedaling. When you use words like "savages, shithole countries, pitiful sand covered shithole, and uneducated barbaric savages," you're attacking everybody, not just the extremists, and you alienate everyone else. If someone doesn't feel like their country doesn't accept them, they'll look for acceptance elsewhere. And besides that, don't learn about religion from some news articles about tragedies. There's a billion-plus other people who don't do messed up stuff.
Pegida, National Front, British National Party, Party for Freedom or one of the other far-right parties in Europe? Or do you hang out on the right here in the States? Or elsewhere? Whatever the case, there's nothing you can do about immigrants or a Muslim presence. The more you ostracize them, the more you'll push them to the militants. Best to get along with them as best you can and, dare I say it, consider them your fellow citizens and natives. They will have a different color of skin than you and have different names than you. They likely will follow a different religion than you. Deal with it. Because humanity doesn't have a good track record of excluding humans because they "aren't like us." If you're in Europe, look backward about seventy-plus years. Or heck, [just three years back to this guy.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Behring_Breivik) Because that's the end game of your ideology.
What's wrong with that?
My whole argument is that Islam teaches NOT to kill people just for having different opinions. This isn't berating, this is arguing. I apologize if you think that's what it is. I don't know if I can convince you of that. Perhaps I can't, but I had to try. Please don't hold prejudice or violence in your heart against Islam. Muslims are full of flaws, but the ones responsible for the attack went beyond the bounds of Islam. That's all that I wanted to say.
That's not what I meant. Cherundolo had a solid but not spectacular career for Hannover and the USMNT. I'd be happy if Yedlin merely reached that level, but to be honest that is the minimum I expect from him.   And the USMNT is pretty deep at RB. Fabian Johnson, Geoff Cameron and Timmy Chandler can all play there. Yedlin may end up being a marquee right midfielder or winger.

Watching the World Cup today, and no mention of the Seattle - Portland game tonight from ESPN.   I didn't see a single mention of the Seattle - Portland game on tonight, despite it being from the same family of networks in the same sport. No promotion, no commercials, nothing. Was this the same for everyone else? I live on the East Coast, so there may not have been any promotion because of that reason. Was it the same on the West Coast?   **EDIT**: Apparently I need to pay closer attention. Way to go ESPN!
