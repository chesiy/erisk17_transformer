[Here](https://goo.gl/maps/apAKw) is a link to the location I took the picture on google maps. It's right at the apex of the big u-turn. There's a pull-off on the side of the road where you can get out and look at the canyon.   If you have time, you should definitely check out Gateway while you're there. There's an awesome place to stay there called [Gateway Canyons Resort](http://www.gatewaycanyons.com) that has TONS of cool stuff. My personal favorite is the auto museum, which isn't that expensive, and you get to go see some really unique cars. The whole place is owned by the guy who owns the Discovery channel, and he's put a lot of work into it and it shows. Anyways, take care and let me know if you have any more questions!

There's always that one friend who ruins everything...
Smile! "Mleh!"
I think it works well as a concept, and it might be something that could work in a few years, but you're probably right about the lack of infrastructure support.
Would you buy a Nintendo smartphone?
Thanks! Purply is one of my favorite planes of existence.

When I first awoke I was alone in a forest. I didnt know my name or where I had come from. I saw strange boxes all around me, creating shapes of things that I knew to be familiar, but with dimensions that betrayed the sense of form that was buried somewhere deep in my memory. As I wandered I became aware of the delicate nature of the world, seemingly shifting from towering hills to sprawling desert and blackest jungle on a whim.  	 The only constant that remained in all of this was an ever-present symbol that stayed in the center of my vision no matter where I went. It always seemed ahead of me, yet I could not believe that it was something I had envisioned. No, it was a beacon, a guide, a powerful force that showed me the one place that I could have any control over the world. It was my guardian, my protector, and my shelter. Without it I would not have survived the night and the creatures that came scratching, bellowing, shooting, and teleporting in numbers far greater than I could have guessed. I owe it my life. This symbol has given me everything, and to it I now build this monument, a cathedral to stand the testament of time.

The sunset tonight looked like a nuclear detonation.

This all took place in the mid 90's when I was about 12. My dad is a Pastor, and we used to live next door to the church in a small town of about a hundred people in the middle of a farming community. One night, I spent the night at my friend's house which was on the same block, about two houses away. I have no idea how, but I ended up sleeping all the way through the night, and when I woke up I was told something about a fire and that we were going to meet my parents at a breakfast for the firefighters. When we drove by the church, the back side of it was burned black through to the frame and there was smoke damage everywhere, not to mention water damage from the firefighting. Again, this was only a couple hundred feet from where my friend lived so I have no idea how I slept through all of it.   There was an investigation as to the cause of the fire, but since it was such a small community with limited resources, the cause was never fully determined. It was just assumed that the fire started in my Dad's office because of his computer and other electronics in there. My grandfather was a firefighter for his whole career and he stopped by and looked at the damage, and in his opinion, he said that there was no way that an electrical short could have caused the kind of fire damage that the building endured. Months go by, things are returning to normal as the church is being rebuilt, and finally it's finished and we start having services in the church again. One day, one of the youth gets up front because he says he has something to say. My spidey-sense is tingling because this isn't normal, his whole family is up there with him and he can't look anyone in the eye. He confesses to burning the church, and my jaw just drops. I can't imagine any other time in my life where I've been as horrifically shocked as I was at that moment. He turns himself into the police, makes his statement, and then does community service at the church. He didn't go to jail because he was a juvenile. I can't remember if he had any kind of detention or not.   Now the scary part. I didn't find out about this until much later, probably when I was 16 or 17 and we had moved away from there. My dad got a call from the police and they said he needed to come in to read the statement that was given by the guy who burned the church. He declined and said that he had already talked to him, and he was ok with it. The police insisted, and told him there was something in the report that he didn't know. My dad went down to the police station, read the report, and found out that the night the church was burned something else had happened. In the middle of the night, while I was over at my friend's house, our family dog started acting weird and insisted to be let outside. My dad got up and let her out and didn't bother waiting for her to want to come back in. After that, both of my parents said my dog was growling and making sounds that they had never heard her make before, like she was trying to keep something out of the yard. Sure enough, on the police report the guy who burned the church said that his intentions were to set my family's house on fire and kill all of us, but he couldn't get in the yard because he was scared of our dog (she was a husky-shepard mix). Another important detail- our house was covered in this foam insulation that would have engulfed the whole house in flames in no time.   Since I wasn't told about it until later in life, it took awhile for it to sink in. Even though I wasn't home at the time, there's still a police report out there that says that someone tried to kill me. I don't know if you ever really get over something like that, but you use it to help you remember that life is precious and to take advantage of every day.   TL;DR Someone tried to burn down my house when I was a kid with my family inside, but was stopped before he got the chance.  (Edit- formatting)
