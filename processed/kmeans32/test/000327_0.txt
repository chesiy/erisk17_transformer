I tend to think you're being disingenuous at this point. Do you not recall the homosexuality/Chick-fil-A dustup?  If not, [here's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chick-fil-A_same-sex_marriage_controversy) the Wikipedia entry.  Clearly the public will not "punish" all businesses for being anti-homosexuality. We have a modern example where the business actually benefited from it.

Helluva time to find that out (for either person)...
Holy shit.
I've been there and got out. This is solid advice.  In 5 years, it will be the best decision you ever made.  Edit: "Been there" = unhappy, not specifically the same or a similar situation.
Well, it is offensive. If not being offensive is something you value, now you know how to approach this issue so as not to be offensive.  Again, it's not a big deal to make the mistake. But knowingly misgendering someone is.
Finally Nearby surfaces! I was getting worried it was going the way of Wave.
You seem to be looking at this from an immature perspective. It's not about offending anyone or "staying classy".  First, if you ask someone you're casually dating if they're "fucking someone else", don't be surprised if you aren't soon dating them anymore.  Second, if you do ask in an appropriate manner, don't be surprised if the answer is something along the lines of "that's not your business".  Adults can have sex with whomever they want. If you're dating one (without exclusivity), it's really not your business. If you want to ask, go ahead - but accept the response and consequences of doing so.  Ultimately, if you want the right to be upset that someone else is "inside of" them too, then ask to be exclusive. This is not hard stuff.

And that's good, but it shouldn't be the end-all-be-all. If the market thinks something awful should happen (e.g., segregation based on race), it should be ignored.  The government should provide a floor to protect rights when the market fails to do so.
nothing is more attractive than a hot chick that doesn't act like a hot chick  No need to stick a gender on this. And although it's not universally attractive, there *is* something appealing about a person who has experienced both being unattractive and being attractive (physically; specifically, necessarily physically - unlike above... on purpose).
You're just moving the goal posts now.  You originally quite clearly said that executive agreements cannot have the force of federal law (i.e., "No. They. Do. Not"). I provided specific case law from the Supreme Court showing that you are wrong.  You're trying to back peddle now by saying "most" have congressional input. That wasn't your original claim at all.  You're also now admitting you're not an expert, which I take to mean you have no legal training. I do, including studying international law in the U.S. and abroad. You're understanding of the law here is simply wrong.  Edit: And for crying out loud... the paragraph immediately before the first you cited contradicts your point. Don't selectively quote, please.

Bankruptcy attorneys who know what they are doing will require payment up front for a Chapter 7 (which sounds like what you filed). If not, the remaining fee is a pre-petition debt that gets stayed and discharged just like any other. Importantly, the client could potentially sue the attorney for violating the stay if any collection efforts are made (such as calling for a payment).  Of course, if you hire a bankruptcy attorney who agrees to a post-petition payment plan with the intention of not paying (because you now know the above), that's probably fraud and not dischargeable.
/u/timacles specifically commented on _Team America_:  Theres are 10 other mediums in which you could watch 'Team America' right this moment.  In reply to this statement by /u/EmJay115:  A group of hackers is controlling what we can and cannot see.  /u/SubHumanGarbage then asked if /u/timacles meant that the _The Interview_ was cancelled for "reasons OTHER than the terrorists hackers attacking [Sony]." That's a red herring and is not what /u/timacles stated. /u/timacles stated that the terrorists are not stopping you from watching _Team America_, and that is true.
Big Wallet user - got it!
I'm not basing this just on the President. I'm basing it also on *the Republican-led committees*. All *seven*. Not everything bad that happens is the result of ill intentions. Sometimes shit happens and mistakes are made. All evidence in this matter indicates that's exactly what happened here.  You're basing your position on your own assumptions, and that's it.
The downtown is subpar relative to Greenville, I'll agree. But it's not bad on its own. I work and play mostly downtown and love it.  Have you been to Craft   Vine? That is a great bar. So is Bee's Knees. There's some room to grow but we definitely have some good bars.  I will have to completely disagree about the restaurants. Frog Hollow was singled out by GQ magazine as a must visit restaurant. And if we are extending out beyond downtown (which I don't think your original complaint was limited to downtown), there's Oliviana's, Fifth and Finch, Tako Sushi, Manuel's, Calvert's, La Maison, and 5 O'clock Bistro. Augusta is known for having many restaurants because of Masters week: many can make enough that one week to survive all year.  I'll also have to strongly disagree about the outdoor aspect. We host the largest Ironman in the country, are the home of disc golf, have a nice river and a canal, great bike trails, and generally pleasant weather. If you think Augusta isn't an "outdoor town", I suggest you're not taking advantage of what it offers.  As for live sporting - I'll agree except for the GreenJackets. But I see that as a function of size. How many cities our size have a lot of live sporting options? Ditto for live music.  Finally, as an unmarried professional, Augusta is overflowing with dating opportunities (and I'm a gay man which limits the pool significantly). Granted, I'm in a three year relationship but am involved and attend SO many things for the young professional crowd and EVERYONE is single.  Overall, my view is that your attitude plays a big part in all this. If you think Augusta sucks, you'll focus on the negative and Augusta will suck. But if you focus on the positive, you will see a city exploding with new and exciting things.  I love it here, and can back that up quite easily.
OP, don't listen to folks like this. Augusta has a large melancholy band of pessimists that poop on everything about Augusta.  The area is objectively nice: good climate, good economy, cheap standard of living, access to outdoor activities, plenty of restaurants, etc.  Plus we just built the first new nuclear reactors in the country and are now the home of the U.S. Army's Cyber Command (fun tech development).  Welcome and I hope you enjoy our city!
I disagree. The will of the people - as a whole - is best expressed during a Presidential election because everyone gets to vote for the candidates. There are 435 House races and 33/34 Senate races during each midterm election; it is hard to determine whether voters in those races were voting for or against any person other than those in each race (such as the President).  The recent election was certainly a Republican win. But it did not represent the will of the people as far as the President's policies are concerned nearly as well as the 2012 election did.
The U.S. Army is basing its Cyber Command in Augusta. Cool tech shit is happening. Ex., Unisys just announced a 700-person IT call center.
Yes, I have. Quit being a condescending prick.  To bring up an example you used elsewhere in this thread...  There is zero practical difference between the government telling me to keep $20 more of my income and the government taxing me as usual but sending me $20. It reduces the amount of money in the government coffers exactly the same (and increase my money exactly the same).  Whatever amount of money you got to keep because you took the student loan interest deduction can just as easily be viewed as a check from the government.

Minor bump in the road. The highest court that will hear the federal case (the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals) struck down Virginia's ban.  SC officials are simply wasting time and money. It's very disingenuous for anyone with knowledge of the legal system to throw up their hands and say, "But who knows how this case will be decided".  We know exactly how it'll be decided, because the highest court that will hear the case already did.
Yes.
I hate ultra orthodox everything.
Yeah it's not that hard to do just as quickly. I'm American and chose to switch to 24-hour because it makes more sense and is useful for my work. That was about 5 years ago and 20:15 means the same thing in my head that 8:15 p.m. does. No math needed.
trivia
I have an idea for reminders in Google Now: Sharing!   I'd like to be able to give my boyfriend access to my reminders (and vice versa). When we are running low on, say, toilet paper, either one of us can say: "Remind me and [boyfriend] to buy toilet paper at Kroger."  When either one of us goes to Kroger... ding!  It seems like it would be easy for Google to do, and I'm sure there are other ways it could be used. Thoughts, /r/Android?
