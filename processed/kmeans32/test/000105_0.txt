There are a lot of skills and experiences that you can parse and structure well. It partly depends on whether you have effectively identified what types of jobs in the corporate world you think you are qualified for.   So I think the bigger question is identifying exactly what you are well suited for within the corporate landscape, and then tailoring your resume / recruitment for that switch.  You can check out a site like tapwage.com to see what types of jobs there are at both large corporations or startups that might translate to your specific interests and skills. After that you really want to tailor your resume as closely to the job postings as possible, especially given the use of resume screening software / ATS.  If you have a very non-traditional background, you could perhaps specifically look at startups that are more open to that background (also are unlikely to use ATS / resume screening software so gives you more of a chance to tell your story).   Targeting categories of jobs and companies is key to a successful transition in your case. The way you portray your specific experiences falls out of that.

Little Sebastian!
I was in a cab the other day and the driver looked stressed as all hell. Told me that he levered up to buy the medallion at $1 million thinking it was the safest investment he could make, and immediately after, the price fell to $500k. He needed to declare personal bankruptcy. It was heartbreaking to hear.

Candidly - you can't cram for such an interview. Also if you do get the job by pretending to know 12+ technologies, you are just setting yourself up for failure on the job which can be detrimental to your reputation in the long run.  Brush up on the 4-5 things you know and make sure you come across really strong and confident in those areas. If they probe on the other areas - be clear and confident that although you aren't up to speed on the other topics - you are a fast learner, are eager to contribute and build a skill set and be a positive force at the job.  Our best bet is coming across as earnest, hardworking and very knowledgable at the things you do know. Sometimes the most powerful thing to say in an interview is "I am not skilled at that but I intend to learn it very quickly and have experience with other similar technologies today". If you try and fake it, you will get caught out either at the interview, or later on the job.    Good luck.
I appreciate the sentiment but the shower thought I wish you had was  - why do countries and imaginary boundaries matter any more. Patriotism is just a false hangover from the high of abdicating our own responsibilities to professional leaders.
I love Rock and Roll Star by Oasis or Spaceman by The Killers to get me going.
I am so glad someone else actually remembers it. Nowadays when I tell anyone about it their eyes glaze over.
Everything2.com   I used to really like this site. The writing was always really fun, but I loved the links below where you could spend hours browsing the site going from random thought to random thought.   And who could forget gems like this: http://everything2.com/title/The+Art+Of+Insulting+-+Introduction (this one has a whole series)  I wish this site would come back to life again and be updated for the mobile age.

I agree. I once watched a movie about the invention of the windshield wiper (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1054588/) 2 hrs of my life I won't get back. Not all heroic stories need film adaptations.

If you want to strike the right balance, I think rather than doing a lot of different types of programming languages (C++, Java, etc), you are better off focusing on a single type of programming and building some depth. Sometimes the easiest to pick up, and often the easiest to demonstrate to an employer is web development. So my recommendation would be to focus on a single area and do a project on that. Either contribute to an open source project on github, or build a practical app.   Its often easier to code when you feel a sense of accomplishment and doing classes or tutorials on C++ 101 etc, rarely gives that sense of accomplishment and doesn't particularly stand out on a resume to an employer. Whether you are doing app or web development, maybe its better to do a small project that you can deploy, perhaps in combination with your networking / infrastructure skills, and that becomes a valuable thing to show as your body of work and will make you much more employable.
All the time. Not just shows, there are so many movies I haven't watched yet (all the summer releases so far), so many TV shows (still haven't watched Breaking Bad, Sopranos, Walking Dead, OITNB), still need to get to podcasts (ReplyAll, etc.), have 1000s of items waiting on my instapaper queue.   I think I'll have a lot of fun when I retire in 30 years.   There is too much great content and I am not sure how everything will find audiences.

One idea that you may not have thought of is looking at startups in "customer experience" roles. These are (perhaps unfortunately) customer centric roles, which I know might be a problem since you describe yourself as not a people person. However, they are really interesting because you are effectively evangelizing and helping the customer experience with a new technology, so unlike retail, its a more promising role.  Moreover, at a startup, you can break barriers, spend time learning and potentially honing your technology and design skills, and have a career path as the startup grows. Moreover, the positive can-do vibe at a startup might be a good change of pace.   I have compiled a list of such jobs here so you can take a look and see what these jobs are like:  http://tapwage.com/channel/hello-customer-meet-startup  Feel free to reach out to us on tapwage.com if you have more specific questions. Happy to try and help.
1. I agree with TunaSandwich - better to have a job before you quit 2. I have found in my experience that sticking at your first job at least 2-3 years credentializes you. Also most jobs suck in the first year so its not unusual to not enjoy it 3. There are very few jobs out there that are going to pay 100k a year for your experience and background  Maybe look at other sales jobs:  http://tapwage.com/channel/rainmakers-with-benefits (a collection of junior sales jobs at large companies)  http://tapwage.com/channel/selling-eyeballs (collection of ad sales jobs)  Do you have an idea of what you enjoy, or are good at? Do you want to get out of sales?  If you are really smart and quantitatively driven, you could consider junior banking and finance jobs. Those pay well and are very intellectually challenging. Here is a collection of those: tapwage.com/channel/beginning-in-banking  Finally - I wrote an article on finding jobs you love that you might find useful: tapwage.com/cheatsheets/2015/05/14/do-you-love-your-job  Good luck. Reach back out if you have more specific questions.
Finding the Job You Love [Based on AskReddit]
It will be hard. Unless you are going to get your degree at one of the top colleges like Harvard or Penn, chances are slim, and even then chances are difficult. There are other great jobs to look at. Maybe real estate finance at a local bank / financial institution. Either way - get moving while at college, try and do as many internships as you can over summers and through the school year and network hard. Good luck.  I run a career site - tapwage.com  We list a lot of banking, investing and real estate finance jobs. Check it out and see if those make sense for you
Being a product manager is a really interesting job at many companies, especially technology companies because you get to experience the life cycle of a product across various division - finance, strategy, technology, supply chain, marketing, etc.  So these roles can be great stepping stone to broader management careers. I think of product management at a tech company to supply chain type jobs at big consumer companies. These are breeding grounds for future leadership.  The best way to understand what these roles are and what these roles require int terms of experience and skill set is by looking at a range of these job postings and getting a sense from how they are framed. Typically these are for former techies who have some management experience or potentially an MBA and show strategic thinking capabilities and good interpersonal capabilities. These roles liaise with nearly every functional group in the company so great interpersonal skills is key.
