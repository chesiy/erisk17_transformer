Okay.
Me? I'm okay I guess...
I've been there too many times, I know what you mean. It just gets harder and harder to break free from the almost cozy darkness. Loneliness, for me at least, is so familiar. It's easier. I try not to let myself get into that kind of thinking, but I guess sometimes I just get so tired of having to try so hard to be 'happy'.
Definitely the live version of Latch by Sam Smith - he's an angel
I'll make sure to! I'm just watching the second season of Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru at the moment (and loving it!) so that's next on my to-watch list! :D
Oh it's okay I found it! I just typed it in wrong the last time :3 Thank you!! :)
Oh my gosh I LOVED Kimi ni Todoke!!!
I've been recommended Golden Time a few times so I'm definitely going to watch it now! I really loved My Little Monster as well! Ano Natsu de Matteru looks good as well! Thank you for your suggestions! :)
I had a look around and can't find the anime you're talking about. Do you perhaps know the Japanese title of it or a link to where I can find it?
I know! It was so good!
That sounds like exactly what I'm looking for! I'll give it a go :)
[Shinsekai Yori](http://www.anime-planet.com/anime/from-the-new-world)   nbsp;   [Kyoukai no Kanata](http://www.anime-planet.com/anime/beyond-the-boundary)   nbsp;   [Barakamon](http://www.anime-planet.com/anime/barakamon)    nbsp;   [Zankyou no Terror](http://www.anime-planet.com/anime/zankyou-no-terror)   nbsp;   These are all great and in my top ten, so I highly recommend them!
I absolutely loved Chihayafuru (and the second season)! Japanese culture really interests me and I love anime they showcase different aspects of the culture, like Chihayafuru does with karuta. More than anything though I just love the characters and how much they love karuta and dedicate themselves to it! Makes me wish I played too :3
I was the same, although in saying that I don't usually cry when watching anime or movies or whatever. YLIA definitely hit me right in the feels though!
That's fair - I really like anime like Shigatsu, so it was pretty addictive for me :3  Maybe try one or two episodes. It was a little bit confusing at times so I could understand that :D
I agree with everyone here recommending Shinsekai Yori - IT'S AMAZING
Is it more important to you to work a high-paying job which enables you to do heaps of awesome things and look after your family or work a job where you can follow your passion and enjoy your work without necessarily earning very much money? For example, I want to earn a lot of money one day so I can buy my mum a house, and afford my own house and take care of my younger sister and afford holidays and stuff.
I feel you - that was tough to get through...still think the ending makes all of that worth it though. And to be honest, I felt like Shun's suicide was sadder than Maria and Mamoru leaving...
I find this hard to accept - I've never failed a test in my life.
I had enough time to study on the train commute thank goodness! I'm probably the worst procrastinator I know. :/
I can't decide if this sounds like a good idea or a bad idea.
Thank you! I actually did this and it helped a lot! :)
Thank you! I didn't really do as well as I'd hoped...but I should be alright!
Me too. Like right now.
Does it have to be Jesus? I'm not confident in how much he knows about International Relations and political theory.
Most amazing site for all logophiles!
What do you do when you haven't studied for an exam?   So I'm going to take an exam this afternoon that I haven't studied for. I'm pretty much resigned to the fact that I'm going to fail. What do you do when you take an exam you haven't studied for?
I would definitely suggest going back and trying to watch it again. It is intense...but worth watching!!
It's unclear whether it's genetic or not, but my family (from what I've been told) has a history of mental illness. I can't help but think that maybe without that, growing up would have been a lot easier.
The last time I watched SSY, I think my mind was spinning from everything that happens in the end that the impact was lost a little bit. This time I'm determined to watch it properly!
The Nature of Squealer/Yakomaru   Arguably one of the more interesting characters in Shinsekai Yori, I thought it would be awesome to see what other people thought of him. What do you think of the change in his personality? Do you think he was plotting everything from the start?   This discussion is to be strictly about Squealer/Yakomaru so spoilers are fine. I mean, it's a bit hard not to discuss a character without talking about everything they've done, right?
I've nearly finished watching Shinsekai Yori and I'm just blown away by the impact it has. Like you, it's leaving me deep in thought and I can't help but feel really...dark. SSY isn't a happy anime by any stretch and I think it's meant to really challenge its audience. Ultimately, I think it makes us think a lot about human nature, and nature of ethics. It's hard not to find myself thinking about not only the characters and the plot, but the deeper themes of the anime as well. SSY is probably the best anime I've ever seen.
