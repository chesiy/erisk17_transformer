Greenville is not as bad as people are saying.  Granted I just moved from there for a job, but my 5 year tenure there was not bad.  I was not a student there, but in my late 20s.  Apartment-wise look in the Wimbledon and Madison (used to called Hyde Park, until they renovated them).  I lived in Wimbledon for 3 years and enjoyed it.

Would I want to be there for long, absolutely not, but for a short period, i.e. grad school, you can deal with it.

Roommate Flower Debacle   Yesterday evening I left flowers on my girlfriend's from door, so that when she came home from bartending and she see them, which would hopefully put a smile on her face since we couldn't have our Valentine's day together.  After not hearing anything from her this morinng, I finally asked her if she saw them.  She responsed with, "You mean those were mine? They are on my roommate's dresser.  She thought she had a secret admirer."  Now we don't have the heart to tell her otherwise, but don't know what to do.  Input...
