Got mine yesterday!
I started at 20, they increased to 30 about 6 weeks ago and now I'm at 40.
I had them anyway so I just went for it.
Sounds good.
Your boyfriend is not perfect.   It's great that he's been there for you through your illness/diagnosis but I guarantee he is/has been feeling stressed by the whole thing.   If you believe his apology to be sincere then accept it.   It's hard to the other person watching someone you love suffer like that and have nothing you can do to fix it. Especially for guys because we like to fix things.   What he said was not supportive and you definitely have a right to be upset about it. I just wouldn't take it as a sign that he thinks you fake things or are a hypochondriac since he's never given that impression before.   Let him know you were hurt by his comments, accept his apology and move on. It's ok to be upset (for both of you), just don't let it poison what otherwise sounds like a good relationship.
Shores of Tuern (XBox)   I'm on the Xbox.   I just finished 'Assist the Zhentarim' step of the campaign and have Shores of Tuern and Lair of Lostmauth available (just missing requirements).   My question: are the unlock costs a one time thing or do I have to pay that every time I want to run them?
Yes absolutely take his offer.   It would be one thing if she was just someone he dated or hooked up with while you guys were broken up but given her history and the fact that she's still trying to sleep with him even after he made it clear he's not into that (since he's back with you) she has to go.  Honestly if I were him I would cut her out anyway regardless of what you said. She is dangerous to your relationship and disrespectful towards you as well.   As for dealing with the jealousy you're just going to have to talk to him. Ask him to be honest with you about what happened between them and ask all the questions you need answers to. And going forward tell him you need to know anytime she tries to contact him, even if it seems innocent at the time.   And if he's comfortable with it, ask for open access to his phone. Just know that if he says no to that request it shouldn't be a deal breaker.  You are both still allowed privacy.   Do your best not to obsess over it. You guys are back together and he's serious about it. Just look at what he told her when she contacted him.  Trust him, it seems like he's doing the right thing.
What's killing me is that what I'm going through doesn't feel normal.  My wife doesn't give a shit about me anymore, she's not going through one of the toughest times in her life, she's already moved on.   And the fact that she can drop me this easily makes me feel absolutely worthless and doesn't really inspire any kind of confidence for my future.   I know even if I could meet someone right away that jumping into another relationship is a bad idea I just wish I had some hope that I could find one sometime in the future.
What's the point?   My wife came to me at the beginning of January saying she wanted a divorce (married 9 years, together for 11).  I wanted to try and work things out but she was not at all interested.  She was convinced that we would never work out and didn't want to 'waste her time' working on a relationship that was destined to fail.  I was already in a depressed state and this did not help things along.  I ended up checking myself into a hospital for most of February.  During that time she did basically everything she could to abandon me.  She never visited, didn't bring our kids to see me, she only called me once.  I found out after I was discharged that she started a relationship with a coworker while I was hospitalized.  Now we barely communicate even though nothing has been finalized.  We are working out a custody agreement but it's not finished and we haven't even discussed dividing assets other than cars.  She's totally moved on with her other guy and I feel more and more lonely every day.  I'm sure that dating someone else right now would be a bad idea anyway but I'm feeling pretty hopeless about my future prospects.  I've never been great at meeting people in general and women in particular and between work and being with my kids I don't know when I'd have time to anyway.  I'm not an incredibly social person.  Plus, I feel like I am a really bad dating prospect.  I'm 33, soon to be divorced, I have 2 kids, suffer from depression, I'm employed at least but by no means am I wealthy, I'm probably about average in the looks department.  I just keep looking into the future and seeing me alone and it's really hard to keep positive about anything right now.  I'm cross posting this to r/Divorce because I don't know how much of this is normal end-of-marriage feelings and how much is my depression talking.
You can't get stuck on the what ifs.   All you can do is look forward.  I think it's good that you have your own place away from him. You need time to think on things and what you want to do going forward and it will be easier if you're not around him.   You need to figure out what YOU want to do. Not what he wants or what his mom or friends want. Not what your family wants, what YOU want.  You're the only one who can make this decision and that's the way it should be because you're the one who has to live with it.   I understand things are shitty now. I totally get what you're saying about your chaotic emotions.   I'm going through a divorce right now and in many ways I'm in the same place.   But things will get better. I'm not saying you'll feel better about what he did but you will find a way to move past it, either with him or without.
For the Earth Arena coming up I have:  Zelnite x2 Dilma Ophelia  For my last spot, should I use Miku or Douglas?  I've heard Douglas is bad but he's 6* and she's only 5*
Do evolution materials need to be max level to use?  Specifically, does Turbo Hydraloid need to be level 80 to evolve Tridon to 6*?
Thanks!  I'll let you know.

Which is the best dungeon for finding Metal Mimics?  Cave of Desires Lvl 1 or 2?
I cannot access this sub's wiki (the one linked above)  I keep getting an error:   you are not allowed to do that  wiki_disabled.  Can anyone confirm if this is a site error or just a me error?

Lilly reads Melchio's SBB as an attack on your team so it fills your BB gauges.
What are the Bulbs used for?  I can't find any info
Thanks. I think I have enough other units to cover what I need so I won't be holding on to my duplicates.   I could use the space anyhow.
