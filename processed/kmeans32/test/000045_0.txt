I'm in IT, and I cant tell you how many people I have met over the years that have made this same mistake.  b vs. B is something I wish the industry would stop doing.  It confuses the hell out of consumers.

[news] Samsung smart TVs now have an advert embedded into Smart Hub menu   This is now a thing with the update that came out the other day.
Yea, I'm generalizing - not knit-picking this pic in particular.  I already gave a recent example (within the past month at Glacier Point) were the use of a drone was very disruptive at a public place.
He's B-team.  He's Defenders material.
I'm torn, but I'm seriously tempted to buy some sort of gun (bb maybe?) to shoot these fucking things down.  Footage like this looks really cool until you are outside somewhere trying to enjoy the scenery/view/etc, and some jackass is buzzing around with one of these things.  These things are not quiet.  They are just like other powerful RC devices: *they are loud*.   I had the displeasure of having to deal with a jackass up on Glacier Point (Yosemite National Park) who was running one of these things back and forth along the cliffs edge getting footage of himself standing there.
All of this is incredibly late "news".  Its already being aptly covered by multiple subreddits that specialize in this sort of issue.  So, /r/news might as well show solidarity and go dark anyway.  There are lots of "news" sources outside of reddit.  Hit the admins where it hurts with your 5.9m subscriber stats.
You could try better rice.  Minute rice is craptastic imho - but, I might be a bit of a rice snob.  Different rices add different flavor nuances as well as textures.  My go-to rice is Nishiki.  Do yourself a huge favor and buy a proper rice cooker.
She has a good look, but I question her acting prowess.
Where can you get a Pho "kit" like this?  I've made it from scratch, and it was a [delicious] pain in the ass!
An American institution, born on the back of a chick with a big ass who fucked Brandy's brother and recorded it.  Remember this fact when you hear people talk with excitement about these degenerates.  edit: this comment has nothing to do with people who are transgender. this comment is a reflection of that family in the media spotlight in general.
Because it portrays him as a "good" person, that would likely not partake in a criminal activity worthy of being shot over.  When telling a story, in any medium, these are things people want to know.  Its interesting, and its how you tell a narrative as a writer.  With that said, as far as I have heard so far, all this kid was is drunk and belligerent.  I'd love to know why he was shot and killed.

I'm guessing a bug bite spooked it?
This is at the Getty right now?  Awesome!  Thank you thank you thank you for posting this information!
Some outstanding points:  1. we dont know anything about the video encoding/bitrates you are trying to playback. 2. we dont know anything about the throughput from your NAS. 3. You say the videos dont playback, and so you "invariably rip a higher bitrate version"?  Some things to do:  1. Get file transfer stats to/from your NAS.  On windows, this is a very small/convenient tool:  http://www.totusoft.com/lanspeed1.html 2. Test against another Plex client.  Some additional things to check out:  1. http://www.readynas.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=76 t=77444 2. https://www.google.com/search?q=ReadyNAS+Pro+video+playback
Thanks for your reply.  No cropping on my part - whats shown is the full extent of the image (it was a still image, not a moving image).  Its from one of the Evangelion "rebuild" movies, and is an image that is shown very briefly during some dramatic dialog, so I cant help but wonder if there is some hidden meaning/text that goes beyond simply "crew room" or "crew compartment".  I wonder that sometimes a word or two in Japanese means one thing, but has similar pronunciations that mean something else that is more devious.
For those keeping track, this is just about the same exact location as the M3.5 on 2015-04-13 "Windsor Hills".  http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/ci37362808#general_summary  Both of these under the oilfields at La Brea and Slauson.
ohh, totally wooshed me on that.  ty.
That quote is not in that PDF.  Its a quote from another reddit thread (which seems to since be missing/edited, but is partially visible via a Google search):  https://www.google.com/search?q=%22iMessage%2C+your+phone+will+actually+send+each+message+six+times%22
I don't have an issue with a critical opinion. It's what hear as a horrible inflection found in many bloggers who cannot seem to curb a condescending attitude that thy project when giving an opinion. It's an audible influence to give further sway that not only are what they are saying is correct, but you should feel dumb for not knowing it.   It's something that you more often hear coming from teenagers. And not to sound sexist, but in my experience, teenage girls.
with the editing that it has, its very likely a body double.  otherwise, they would use a panned shot to show you that *holy shit*, this is the lady you've been wanting to see get nekkid.
Options for non-transcoding Plex clients?   Over in /r/cordcutters, theres always a heavy argument against against smart TVs, and I understand some of the rightful points.  But, one thing I really appreciate about my smart TV is that my plex client app can direct play videos, and not require streaming/transcoding.  This is great, as it is a viewing device that puts very little load on my Plex server.  Besides PCs and smart TVs, which other DMPs that can direct play?
Got bored: Created an 2.5in. x 5in. antenna from stripped coax in the shape of a figure-8. Works great! Thoughts?   This evening I took a ~24in. length of left-over coax and decided to create a small antenna for my bedroom TV that previously has just been used for my Roku over wi-fi.  I didn't use any formal guides for making a DIY antenna.  I dont have any particular reason for going with the antenna shape that I did, other than I wanted it to be compact and not rely on a rig of some sort to be attached to. I just stripped the wire, and came up with a shape to try based on whatever I could recall from electrical and electronics courses I took 20 years ago.  Most of the stations I am interested in came in great. I was shocked.  Broadcast location is 21.5mi. away on a mountain top. Not pure line-of-site, but am facing that direction.  Pictures with additional descriptions:  [http://imgur.com/a/NE3oU](http://imgur.com/a/NE3oU)  As shown, this antenna is strapped to the back of the TV and sits about 6 inches from the far-right edge of a window.  The window has blinds and a shade in front of it as well.  But, the window (and subsequently the antenna) do face the direction of the TV broadcast sources - although not open LOS.  Am I crazy?  Lucky?  Should I try a larger configuration?  Edit :grammar
If you are bored waiting for 4.0, here's something to do if you have the media available to you: Watch the director's cuts of E21-24 side-by-side with the originals.   I found it very interesting to see what they changed between the versions.  Its not just shimmed in scenes.  They made certain things grittier and dirtier looking. They swapped in/out things in the background.   They changed facial expressions.  They changed the direction/orientation of bodies/faces.  It all gives a different impression to the scene, even for those scenes that the dialog did not change in.

I'm aghast with the utter disregard that many Angelenos seem to have for emergency vehicles   Today, case-in-point, two emergency vehicles are going north San Vincente in the 55 zone.  My traffic group is coming to a stop at Stocker St with the emergency vehicles approaching from behind.  I can see and hear them approaching.  I'm in the center lane at the head of the line, but I leave room in front of my car so I can let the guy in the front left lane pull to the right to let the emergency vehicles through.  He doesnt do it.  I yell to him in his car, trying to get his attention over the fact that he's listening to headphones.  He finally takes them off, takes a moment to open and start eating a Redvine, listens twice more to what I have been repeatedly trying to tell him - and then he tells me to "calm down."  I tell him, "dude, I left you space in front of my car so you can get out of the way!"  Meanwhile, there are other people in my lane pleading with other cars in the left lane behind me to move out of the way of the emergency vehicles.  He stares at me and will not move until all the other cars behind him have moved - wasting precious minutes for the emergency vehicles.  What the fuck is wrong with people?
