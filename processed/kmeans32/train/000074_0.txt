My mom had this CD with a whole bunch of seemingly random songs on it that she would play for me when I was a baby. The first track was You've Got To Hide Your Love Away (Anthology version).
Let's make something wonderful of someone's life!
Wow, that's odd
Both of my hands say 10
At least it's not something about relationships.
Aww man, I just tapped the touch pad on my laptop by accident! I know how you feel pal.
"Is that my belt?"

What's a song where the intro is the best part?

[Serious] What song do you consider to be the most beautiful?   It doesn't necessarily have to be your favorite song, just whichever one you think is the most beautiful. I'm talking about anything at all: classical, rock, metal, hymns, folk, tribal chants... Just so long as it's pleasing to you.
American Express, directed by Wes Anderson
I'd have to agree with you on that!
Now we wait?
That's what I thought too. This scene and the "boss fight" scene in the streets were a little *too* fantastical for my tastes.

Well, all the better games are usually more expensive...
I guess it depends on where you live. Pretty much all of the schools near me have drug/bullying problems, nothing major but enough to garner attention. The short time I did go to a "real" school wasn't bad at all though. In fact I rather enjoyed the whole experience! All my friends who were home-schooled and went to school are very happy.
When I was younger my parents had a lot of input about what I was doing for school work. These past couple of years I've been overseeing myself mostly. No tutors per say, but my mom knows a lot of teachers and she sometimes gets them to do something like, a weekly math class for a month or so.
Me, in an orange t-shirt and brown shorts playing tag with my cousins. I remember this because it was *the moment* I realized I existed. I know it sounds weird, but at that moment I stopped playing for a second and thought: "I'm here"  I then went on to win that game of tag.
Oh, I didn't know that! Thanks!
Yes, this is it! Thank you so much! I've been searching for this forever!
[TOMT] [Song] Modern(ish) Jazzy song?   I've only heard the song I'm looking for twice. Both times it was played on a radio station that plays bands like: AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, The Beatles, The Allman Brothers, Lynyrd Skynyrd and other bands, mostly from the 70's and 80's. I think it has piano, drums, bass, vocals and flute for most of it. Just one man is singing. I can't remember any of the lyrics to it. Please let me know if there is anything else that would help!   Edit: It's not a rock song at all. It sounds like it should be on an easy listening station or something like that  Edit 2: I took a look at some more Jethro Tull songs and the one I'm looking for sounds a lot like Jethro Tull's [Serenade To A Cuckoo cover](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zh4GZJlQCfY) except with a singer and more upbeat.
