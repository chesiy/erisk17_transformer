Daigo didn't even played badly. Ai Ai Juri play was beyond insane and thoroughly outplayed him. So happy he won and made top 8 at EVO. I hope to see him appear future tournaments to come.   The saddening thing was Daigo even admitted before Evo he was scared of him because of Ultra 1 so he should've used another character. Again Daigo's biggest weakness of his pride when it comes to counter-picking is shown here. I hope him watching Top 8 EVO makes him realise this.
Here is a noteworthy list of most successful players in SF4 series at EVO for Top 8   List on the most well-known names:  Daigo - 5 times: (2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013)  Infiltration - 4 times: (2010, 2012, 2013, 2015)  Gamerbee - 4 times: (2010, 2012, 2013, 2015)  PR Balrog - 4 times: (2009, 2012, 2013, 2015)  Tokido - 3 times: (2011, 2013, 2015)  Ricki Ortiz - 3 times: (2009, 2010, 2014)  Momochi - 2 times: (2014, 2015)  Fuudo - 2 times: (2011, 2014)  Poongko - 2 times: (2011, 2012)  Sako - 2 times: (2013, 2014)  Luffy - 1 time: (2014)  Xian - 1 time: (2013)  Bonchan - 1 time: (2014)  Justin Wong - 1 time: (2009)  Mike Ross - 1 time (2010)
Gamerbee came 2nd also in EVO 2012. Heartbreaking for him to get runner up again after all that work.
Don't forget the extra twitch views from the Topanga Japan stream.
Marvel finally reached 150K twitch views!
A wild DJ ipad appears
What a douche.
Am I the only person that gets really disturbed and creeped out when Daigo is just casually smiling in a high-pressure situation match?
That match took like 2 minutes WTF
I mentioned "phone" not "phones" mate
GG Window!
Damn I missed that...that sucks then :(  Still a pretty cool idea if it actually happened some day.
Seth Killian's commentary can be very condescending and smug sometimes. Also dickrides Daigo too much when he's playing (see Evo 2013 Top 8). However, his style is very interesting to hear compared to other commentators since rather than focusing by what's happening in the match, he focuses on the mindset and mentality of players as a whole and on the fly. You can thank his doctorate in philosophy for all of these insights.   Zhi is an enigma. When he's under restraint in a professional environment, he is actually the best commentator when it comes to play-by-play. But 90% of the time, he's on the extreme spectrum of "colour" commentary. He's like a hit-and-miss vesion of Aris when it comes to the anime references/memes/jokes. He's halfway between good and high tier a.k.a his own tier. This is because he has the advantage of knowing the Asia FGC scene better than the US commentators as well as capable of speaking it.  Mike Ross is terrible end of story. But I guess that's his style in terms of being a "hype" man in a WWE way. Both Ultra David and James Chen admit that when they are paired up with him, they sometimes accidentally say stupid shit. That says it all.   Combofiend isn't much better but since he works for Capcom, his play-by-play is slightly better and seems articulate on the mic.  The most frustrating thing about James Chen is that he's the perfect template of what a commentator should do, but I feel like his work on it has barely improved throughout all these years of experience. He should already realise by now on the faults he has when commentating such as getting stuff wrong within the match, being mis-informed on other stuff relating to players and such. Otherwise, when he's paired with Ultra David, most of the time he is very good.
Warner's 'stache is an assault to the senses
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2reKhU28GWA  Skisonic's finest commentary [](/Kappa)
Ryan Hart uses Ryu, Yun, Decapre, Abel. What do u expect? He's given up being a Sagat specialist.   He's no Bonchan. He's not even on Gachikun and Santarou Man level in terms of Sagat play.  He's probably on par with Sanford Kelly though. hehehe....
