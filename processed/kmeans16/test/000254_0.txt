Deathly Hallows Part 2 - an emotional, well-made and EPIC conclusion to the series. One of my all time favorite movies!
TIL that the Batman   Robin sequel was to be called "Batman Triumphant" and director Joel Schumacher wanted Nicolas Cage to play The Scarecrow.   Title pretty much says it all really.   Plus Harley Quinn was going to be in it as The Joker's daughter attempting to kill Batman for revenge of the Joker's death.   I know lots of you guys may already know this but i read it today and found it funny. Thoughts?
