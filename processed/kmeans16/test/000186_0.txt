The more Scott Walker campaigns, the more he proves he is not intellectually fit for the office hes seeking. He asserts innocent ignorance on matters he should by now know something about  a way of masking his apparent bigotry.   I don't care much for Richard Cohen, but he's got Walker figured out pretty well.
I always remember this John Kenneth Galbraith quote when making political decisions.   Politics is the art of choosing between the disastrous and the unpalatable.  Am I thrilled by the backers of and all the choices made by the  Clintons and Obama? Of course not. Would I take take them again over another Bush or Scott Walker, etc?  Absolutely.
Like Sara Palin, Walker plays the politics of resentment quite well. Wisconsin's biggest economic problems center around the still shrinking manufacturing economy, but Walker's managed to convince part of the electorate that Wisconsin's problems are the over-educated liberals, overpaid civil servants and welfare recipients.  Meanwhile he's greatly reduced public services, ended many employment protections, and has ground down Wisconsin's education system, which was one the finest in the country.  He wants to makeover Wisconsin into the low wage model, typically found in the reddest states. I see the strategy he's using, but why people keep falling for it, I wish I understood.
It's the same game of hide the ball the GOP has playing since the 1980's.  Look at this tax cut!  Think how much working families will save! No need to look at the numbers too closely.  It's a tax cut for everybody!
Haskins called it a rather extreme position to say that we ought to allow dangerous pollutants to destroy the only planet we know of that can completely sustain human life, and he suggested work on technologies that can reduce CO2 emissions without destroying whole economies.  Tell me, after your organizations spent a couple decades trying to deny an obvious truth, why would I take any argument offered by ALEC or the Heartland Institute seriously in the future?
There are a number of ideas floating around, including a couple in the article.  But the issue is that Walker promised his economic policies would create 250,000 jobs in four years and it hasn't happened.  Instead of admitting that the projection might have been off the mark or that no Governor has enough control over an economy to make such a promise, (or even, heaven forbid, admit  that his policies might not give the results he expected) he's always blaming the protesters or the media or Obama or just about anyone else. Accept any responsibility for the lackluster economy in Wisconsin?  That's not the Scott Walker way.
I think everything is working as planned.  Most of the earlier tax cutting was on income taxes, and are being replaced with 'much regretted' consumption taxes and fees, which fall more heavily on lower and middle classes.  I used to believe the good sense of the American people wins out in the end.  Now, I'm beginning to think it's their gullibility.
Sure we have a number of unnecessary regulations.  But what's really gone wrong with America's economy is  the movement of wealth and income to a small minority at the top.  This is a side issue and a distraction.
That's an impressive accomplishment. I doubt I would have done nearly as well in your situation.  But I fail to see what the advantage is in charging tuition for community college, any more than to charge to go to high school.  There's a pretty good argument that "both history and economics suggest that nothing may have a greater effect on the future of living standards than education policy" ([Link](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/09/upshot/the-roots-of-obamas-ambitious-college-plan.html). We need an educated workforce, and we should be doing every damn thing we can to make one.
Meanwhile Democrats, who should naturally have the upper hand in any honest fight for the increasingly populist American electorate, were too busy running away from President Obama to embrace the effective aspects of his agenda. As Andrew Sullivan wrote on Election Night, If you wonder, as I do, why Democrats never actually defend their policies or even achievements in power, and run solely on some poll-tested social issues, then your bafflement will likely only increase tonight, as mine has. The New Republics Alec MacGillis noted that in the three states that saw the biggest coverage gains under ObamacareKentucky, Arkansas and West VirginiaDemocratic Senate candidates shied away from pointing that out. And all lost badly, MacGillis tweeted.  Do you think the Democrats will ever offer the electorate a real choice?  Or are we in for more years of 'not quite as horrible as Republicans' as our alternative?
1) If the legislators pushing voter ID were truly worried about voter fraud, they would make provisions so every voter had an ID. When you have laws in Texas that make a gun ID valid for voting (more often owned by conservatives) and a student ID not valid (a group that tends to vote more liberal), it strains credulity to think it's only about voter fraud. 2) In person voter fraud is insignificant, less that a rounding error. I'd be far more concerned about who counts the votes.
Its puerilty has finally crossed over into indecency. Its triviality has finally crossed over into obscenity. The comical political starfcking that is its primary raison d'erp has finally crossed over into $10 meth-whoring on the Singapore docks. Once a mere surface irritation, Tiger Beat On The Potomac has finally crossed over into being a thickly pustulating chancre on the craft of journalism. It has demonstrated its essential worthlessness. It has demonstrated that it has the moral character of a sea-slug and the professional conscience of the Treponema pallidum spirochete. Trust me. Stephen Glass never sunk this low. Mike (Payola) Allen has accomplished the impossible. He's made Jayson Blair look like Ernie Pyle.  That, Ladies and Gentlemen is an insult for the ages. And he maintains the pace for the entire article.
I read Vonnegut as a teenager and young adult, and then ignored him for years afterward, thinking he was an entertaining writer, but kind of an intellectual lightweight.  But as I've gotten older , I've come to the opinion he may not have been the most subtle or original thinker America produced, but damn, he was often right on the money.  You needn't be a complex writer and thinker to be a good one.
Considering Bush left him two wars, an economy in shambles and a civilization threatening climate problem (Sorry,but I think scientists usually know what they're talking about) , and he had to deal with a Senate that set the record for filibusters and a House that came close to causing a default on the national debt because it wanted to pitch a tantrum about the ACA, I'd say he's done all right.  Of course Dick Cheney is still eligible to run for President, if you'd like a repeat of the Bush administration.
[Or maybe this racket] (http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/dec/06/alan-grayson/alan-grayson-says-more-walmart-employees-medicaid-/), were a business 'socializes' it's labor costs .  We can around and around pointing out our favorite hypocrisy on the other side, but it won't change anything.  We can decide we want a society that tries to include the less successful or pushes them down harder.  If we're committed to inclusion, their lives will improve. If we aren't (and I don't think we've ever made more than a half-assed effort), we won't .
Sure, but let's also remember that the OWS was a genuine grass roots movement, not an astroturf outside funded movement like the Tea Party.  I'm inclined to think social movements often sputter out a couple of times before they catch fire.  It's not like civil rights movement began the day Rosa Parks decided not to give up her seat on the bus.  If OWS turns out to be a only catalyst, that might be all America is ready for.  I remain optimistic, although I'll admit in part because I can't stand to think of my kids growing up in the world the right wing wants to create.
