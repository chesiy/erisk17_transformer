Glad I clicked.
It scared me how many people have loaded guns close to them. I'm in Australia and I've literally never seen anyone other than a cop with a gun. Y'all are weird.

Hey man, I hope you don't feel humiliated anymore. My bro broke his neck and was in a spinal unit too. Everyone there shits themselves. He's out now and still occasionally shits the bed. We just tell him not to worry and wash the sheets. If your people don't understand your medical condition leads to you sometimes having accidents then you need new people.
Ambidexterity. Fine motor control on one side and gross on the other.   No wisdom teeth.
I'll PM you in a couple of days with a link.

Damnit, I should've read on 5 minutes ago. I just sent a pic of my eyes only to find out I wasn't the first. Ripped.
Try some different beers. I can't stand lager, which is what people generally think of when they say 'beer'. The clear slightly yellow bubbly liquid that tastes like carbonated piss.    Try a stout, porter or amber ale. They have a bit more balls and flavor to them. If you're American you should be able to get you hands on Brooklyn Brown Ale fairly easily. Australian, try the Holgate Chocolate Porter.
