Since the Affordable Health Care Act, Nevada has been hiring eligibility workers.  It's a tough job, but the state does not discriminate on age.  https://nvapps.state.nv.us/NEATS/Recruiting/ViewAnnouncement.aep?recruitmentId=23887
Accidental Hero: Marcuse's "One-Dimensional Man" at 50 (plus an interesting outline of the 60's)
Several things:  To lose weight, I have to cut way back and exercise.  I lose weight and need to cut my calories again to lose more weight.  I don't think I can cut them any farther!  I also have a history of yo-yo dieting.  I always end up weighing more than before I started!  I think if I would have worked out more when I was young and never dieted, I wouldn't weigh what I do today.  I don't know if that makes sense, but that is how I feel.  It is also a lot of work and takes more time than I want to spend on the topic.  I do know I would feel better though.
I knew someone like that 20 yrs ago who had clients who would pay him - and he was respected in the field! I would hear him on radio shows talking as an expert.  But he was just a fast-talker - just like you are writing about.  I knew his wife.  Not sure if he is around today.  I think the only license you would need is a straight business license (but I'm not an expert).  UNLV offered a class one semester on handicapping and I made my husband go - it caused a stir (not sure I remember why), and they never offered the class again.  That being said, there is probably room for a smart handicapper.  The ones that publish in the paper have always sucked.  The really good handicappers work for the sportsbooks setting odds in the first place.
I'm so tired of it too, and then I think of these crazies trying to tell ME how to be.  I don't mind if they live their own lifes the way they want; just don't prevent me from living my life too.
Some of these right-wing idiots will do anything to screw us.  This was an article I saved last year regarding a guy from Chicago: http://truth-out.org/opinion/item/17917-bombshell-plutocrats-brazenly-collude-to-hurt-state-economies-and-screw-working-people
Nice.
Me too.
Thank you for your thoughtful contribution.  I saw a book on c-span today that was addressing these very issues...http://www.truth-out.org/article/item/1388:gar-alperovitz-the-prehistory-of-the-next-possible-progressive-era This is a Truthout article on his book and thoughts about the subject.  He was talking today about coops, but he said long term we need to define the type of democracy we want.
Wow. Thanks for the post. And since I missed the previous post, I'm glad you did this.
Sick.
I can't believe that I found it.  I knew him through his manager who was named Red (It's been too many years now!)  Saw him box at the Showboat.  I remember the infamous Howard Cossell talking on tv on what a strong boxer he was.  He didn't have the move Ali had, but he could hit.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._T._Gordon
You are making the assumption that it is all the fault of social security and medicare.  We have been spending a billion a week for years on a war.  Social security isn't even a part of the budget.  Boomers paid 110% more than they should have to cover the costs of social security.  Americans LOVE those programs and will pay for them.  This has been a plan by republicans to starve the beast - and get rid of those programs.
Apply online at the mgmcareers.com.  They are the major employer on the strip.  Who knows.  People do get hired.  I also know a woman who recruits for them also, normally low-paying jobs like guestroom attendents.  Mail me your resume and I'll get it to her.  She may be able to chek out if they ever hire on HIB visas, or whatever.
When I was young, we used to take the turn at Glendale going north (off the highway heading to the Valley of Fire and Moapa), and would go to Warm Springs.  In those days, they had three swimming pools open to the public.  I haven't been there in almost 30 years now, and the last time I saw it, one was privately owned, and the other two pools were empty.  I'm not sure what it is like today, but it looks like it is a wildlife area now. http://www.snwa.com/env/wsna.html There are petroglyphs at the Valley of Fire.
Romney didn't run for a second term because he had a 31% favorability rating.  Additionally, he vetoed 800 bills passed by the Massachusetts legislature.  I didn't link the stats, but you can find them fairly easily by googling them.  So much for bipartisanship.  We have to end this plutocracy.  Our only hope we change the constitution or find a way out of this pay for play system, and save the middle class.  Otherwise, we will all lose.
