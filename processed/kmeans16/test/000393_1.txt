You know, the fact that you're even agonizing over this, over someone who has hurt you a lot in the past, shows that you are a good person who is still able to try and see things for what they are, instead of twisting them around like Ns do.  Also, most people desire a relationship with their families, ESPECIALLY after they have kids of their own. You're not some fickle, bratty, hormonal teenager who doesn't appreciate their parent. I don't think that most people on this subreddit can say that they didn't wish they had more "normal" parents that they can go to for advice, emotional support, or things like that. The fact that you feel something is wrong, and need to create more extensive boundaries with someone who is flesh and blood says something.  The sad part is not many people understand this, especially with the subtle (to other people) abuse of an Nparent. Please, do what is right for you and for your daughter. You have dealt with your Nmom for your whole life, you know her games, and you know how to avoid participating in those games.   What I'm saying is, trust yourself, and don't let the family push you to do something you don't feel is right for you.
Very true, good point!
Yeah :/ I feel you. Thank you for the hugs
Haha, I love this
Well, I live in Green Bay WI. This is really stereotypical, but gamedays during football season are absolutely amazing, especially if you're actually going to the games or just tailgating anywhere near Lambeau. Everyone is so nice. It's like having a huge family who you can drink with and party with and love the Packers with. It is a totally unreal experience and it was amazing to grow up here, and I'm not even that into sports, really!  Football is our religion here. It's not an exaggeration what you hear about the cheeseheads haha. Everyone takes their prom pictures at the stadium, a fancy night out is taking a loved one to one of the stadium restaurants, or a restaurant named after someone associated with the Packers...yeah. Everyone should visit Green Bay on a game day sometime haha
Why do you ask?  Edit: I'm an idiot. Yeah, it is. But he's my step-dad. He's sired the two youngest. Gross. I never want to think about that again
You look like Ariana Grande!
Thank you!
Hey, all you fabulous people!   So, I kind of broke a rule (oops) as I've posted before without doing an intro. /u/blanksy was kind enough to remind me in chat that I needed to do one!  Anywho, I just wanted to say that I love this subreddit, and love the idea of having contests and being able to commit random acts of kindness within the context of makeup. This subreddit is so supportive and kind. I reaallllly love makeup and have a growing collection. My friends think I'm crazy obsessed, but they don't mind so much when they need someone to do their makeup, haha. I've only recently had the ability to start feeding into my hobby more in terms of finances and RAoM really makes me feel like I have a home and a comfortable place to showcase what I have learned over the years. Thanks for that!  My other hobbies include singing, reading, and listening to music. I also study Spanish so if anyone here speaks Spanish or is also learning we can practice together. I think that's it! Keep being fabulous!
Wow, this is absolutely gorgeous! I love that lip color on you. I would say that if you want your features to stand out more in pictures, you might wanna turn up the drama on your eyes so that your beautiful features don't get lost in the distance! Perhaps that's not the look you want to go for, but that's what I would recommend. :)
Mmm.

Flushing the toilet.
No.  Your cat's high.
I regularly babysat for my neighbor's daughter, and the day this happened was just a regular day. We were walking to the park, and in the parking lot she saw a puddle that had oil in it, which was making a rainbow. She looked at it and looked up at me to see that I had seen it as well. I smiled back at her. We didn't mention it for the rest of the night. It was just one of those mundane and seemingly insignificant occurrences.  I feel I should also mention that she hardly ever talked except to say something absolutely brilliant and creative, except she was a little morbid.   I was scared to see her at night, since she looked like a typical little girl that should have been in a horror movie (blue eyes that pierced through your soul, pale with very dark brown hair that could have been black, nightgown etc.) and it was usually at night when she woke up to deliver one of these glimpses into her strange little mind.  She had gotten out of bed absolutely silently and had stepped slightly in  front of me, where I was sitting on the couch, watching TV. I jumped a little. Never got used to it.  She asked me, "That rainbow? That we saw on the ground today? It fell from the sky, and it died, didn't it?" Then she got really close to my face.  "And you just SMILED."   I was too creeped out to go back there. Now when I see one of those puddles on the ground I get shudders. Her mind must be a scary place.
