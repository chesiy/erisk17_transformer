I actually have been working on this for the past few weeks for work. I will put it in a Google doc tomorrow and post it here. However I have only looked at 4 issues ; economy, immigration, health care, and foreign policy. But I have clips from all candidates speeches and chart to keep track of how you agree or disagree with a candidate. I teach government so that's why I did this.
Some things that really helped me were colored eyeliners instead of shadows, and rocking power brows. I put the colored liner on the outer third of my eye and blend it in towards the inner corners.  I had to come to terms with the fact that I can't really pull off some make up looks I love. So I focus on lips and brows and my skin . you have lovely eyes and there are a few make up artist on YouTube who could probably show you some tips and tricks, but that's what works for me.
I started playing a few months ago, and can already play a few songs . it is my first instrument and while it is challenging I am able to teach myself with the help of the internet and a couple books. I am not sure I could say the same for other instruments. I picked the ukulele because it seemed fun, I liked the sound ,and I liked the idea of traveling with it. I get what your saying that billing it as easy may discourage new players when it requires practice and patience like any other instrument, but people who do things just because they are easy typically don't make it too far in any endeavor.
Was a bartender before I was a teacher vodka soda with citrus is my go to diet cocktail. Avoid juice or mixers, as far as beer goes ultra has low calories and is pretty widely avalible
Thanks I will give it a try!
He is very thoughtful most of the time after I explained it he totally understood.
Hey I am all for trying the natural way before taking drugs. You have definitely given me some things to think about. I am sorry that I can't do the oily fish I know it has great health benefits but I haven't eaten meat in 17 years I feel at this point it would make me sick both physically and mentally. Do you have any plant based suggestions for omega 3s I eat a lot of flax and chia seeds so I feel I am prob OK o. The 6s
I went to an eating disorder clinic many years ago not as a vegan but as a vegetarian. When I checked in I was allowed to list 3 things I wouldn't eat I chose chicken beef and pork (I figured they wouldn't serve much fish and I was right) after three days of complying with the menu they gave me I was allowed to  choose the foods I wanted as long as they met my dietary requirements so I actually never ate meat while I was there had yoghurt a couple times and eggs once when I didn't get to choose. I hope this helps put you at ease a bit . I have been in recovery for 6 years its a hard battle but I am much happier now than I was back then. If you want to talk inbox me.
Yes you should give up your seat to anyone who is in need... pregnant, elderly, disabled, here take my seat. For no other reason than it is the right thing to do. You can not like kids and still like people. And I am sure I will get down voted to hell for saying this but sometimes this sub is less about being child free and more about hating kids. I like kids I don't have them because I like my freedom more . pregnancy is difficult for most women and if I can ease someone's suffering a bit by standing on the metro then I will.
I think it is a Scottish fold cat
It was pretty much like bartending anywhere else except I wore a corset.
I agree with you I try to eat healthy but tofurky and vegan cheese are great to have around when I just want to make a sandwich for lunch. I recently moved close to a grocery store that has tons a lot of  vegan options and it makes staying vegan so much easier.
What of instead of bus boys, restaurants just had trained  dogs you fed scraps to, and then they took the plates back to the dish washer. Edit spelling and stuff
The miseducation of Lauren Hill...one of the few albums I bought new and still listen to regularly. I love every damn song
Ginger dread man
I am a teacher and personally I would find it odd to date a former student mostly because they are so immature. But my mom was a former student at the high school my dad taught at. He never taught her but he knew her as a student they were 5 years a part and started dating a year after she graduated. Granted this was in the 70s but they got married and had 2 kids so it depends on the situation and the people.
We had a first year teacher this year with 4 preps and no prior education experience. I think he had a degree is bussiness and was teaching marketing type classes. He quit 6 weeks in he didn't realized what teaching would be like and   he didn't have the skills or support to push through it. It isn't for everyone, that guy was a smart, good guy who will be great at someone's company he just wasn't meant to be a teacher. The same way that I would probably crash and burn at a marketing firm. What others have said is helpful too take a day off ask for help, see what is on teachers pay teachers on days when you are overwhelmed with planning. It gets easier , but if you don't like it and it,s making your life miserable then getting a routine down isn't going to make you love it all of the sudden. Best of luck whatever you decide to do.
This is a well.thought out responce. I teach US history, we are doing a unit on slavery and there are just so many parallels . Especially how abolitionists were seen as extremist, and mocked for their beliefs. I think that the move towards veganism will happen out of necessity of saving resources, rather than moral issues. But who knows the movement is gaining traction everyday and it is becoming more mainstream, so here is hopping.
What subjects do you teach?  Are you the only history teacher in the school? Part of your department head's job is to help you grow also reach out to other teachers in general they can give you some ideas you can tweak , good teaching practices can be applied to most subjects.
Have the students do a Mini DBQ. For my US I have them watch the crossing and do follow a long question sheet and then write a short essay. It never hurts to have a review of the stuff we do in the beginning of the year. Also mini DBQ, and a movie are pretty hard for a sub to mess up.
This is what I love ab the bi community, you would be hard pressed to find a group of people more open minded and willing to see people as individuals.
Cellar door
Perhaps I can shed some light on the situation, I had been in only hetero relationships and while I was interested in f/f relationship it just never really presented itself. I met a lesbian and we hit it off as friends after hanging out a few times she told me that she thought she was developing feelings for me. I was really thankful for her honesty because it let me choose to experiment with her and not feel pushed into it. We dated for a little while and while the physical part of the relationship was good I realized I couldn't fall in love with her and I ended things. Because our relationship was built on honesty we both did minimal damage to one another.  So your assumption that for mostly straight folks it may not be more than a physical expression may be correct, I think that if you handle this relationship with honesty and respect then it could have a positive out come.
I have 30 jobs total , but some of them are repeats my desk are split into 3 section and each sections has a specific person to get materials, collect papers, make sure the desk get re-organized after group work, some of my other jobs are answer the phone, open the door when there is a visitor, a person to fix typos on the power point, someone to water the plants, a person to let me know when the supply table is running low. a person to pass back graded work.I give them all very professional sounding names. It helps the class run smoothly and everyone contributes .
BS in psyc MA in education
Abnormal psychology, I got a psyc degree before I became a teacher and spent a lot of time studying abnormal psyc. I found it fascinating and terrifying at the same time. I have a deep seeded fear I'll get dissociative fugue at some point in my life. I also secretly diagnose everyone with very mild forms of psychological disorders in my head just to keep myself from forgetting the symptoms.

My boyfriend drooled on my pillow and when we woke up i said "ewww you drooled all by my face " and he said laughing "it just means that I love you" which is how he told me he loved me for the first time. So if you want to distract a lady friend from your drool just drop the L-bomb
I looked for the things that I got excited about, and for the things that pulled at my heart strings. that brought me to the idea that I wanted to help people  then I had to figure out what kind of job I could get helping people. I had always had an ability to break things down simply, so I would become a teacher. I tell me high school seniors to think about what they love and what they are good at and try to find a job that uses their talents
Network like crazy, go to every job fair you can, check out the chamber of commerce meetings, and see what job connections your professors have.The longer I am in the professional world the more I agree with the statement "it isn't what you know , but who you know." Also be punctual and play nice with others, being late and not getting along with co-workers are the main reasons people get fired.
