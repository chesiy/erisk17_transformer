Thanks man, and congrats! Hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoy mine :)
Was pretty good thanks for asking, I've been eating super healthy the last month so my body was craving something like this lol
Birdie.
SubieFlow is a page that I'm a big fan of, didn't know I needed a turbo to sport one of their decals lol
The Crosstrek is a very cool ride. However, so is your '13 so be sure to enjoy it. Anyone who owns a Subaru is bound to have a blast regardless of the model!
Gives me +10 HP
You thought wrong little one.

Colorado I can understand due to the snow, but Seattle? They rarely even get snow lol. I'm not complaining though, the more Subies the better :D
Is it really worth that much?
I guess you wouldn't mind coming to Canada to help me out with my rims? I'll buy you a case of beer? lol
Want to be friends?
You should be head of marketing for Chipotle good Sir.
and?
I'm glad you got my reference lol. *DONG*
SHAME
yeah I suppose, just a fan of leather, push to start, nav, sound system, spoiler. If I can get it already with all of that then less work for me.
Yeah I feel you on this, I do love that god awful wing on the STi though so I would be sad not having one lol
STi is more expensive, although the WRX isn't an STi I think things like leather and push to start would be cool to have. Not to mention with the money saved I could still go crazy with all the cobb parts I want lol. Thanks for the input
Why can't desperate and single girls like this call my phone?
Congrats, inspirational transformation!
ohh alright, Infiniti is nice but for the price I'd much rather drive a BMW
damn, this should be under NSFW
Shout out to Sauga boys!
Nice! I'm in Ontario too :D
Which color to get?   I'm about to purchase a 16' STi Sport and can't decide on the color. I have it down to WRB, White, or DGM. I'm leaning towards DGM but not 100% sure yet. What do you all think?
I normally don't like blue but the STi is an exception, really speaks to the Subaru heritage. Although the black/red interior makes me OCD run wild as it doesn't go with blue at all IMO lol
no proxy, im in Canada. I made an amazon.com account. used my canadian credit card and just put in a random US address.
wow nice, this was before the stability stuff existed? Don't see how the tree stuff is possible. Also were you an Admin? tons of mats for those id assume.
link?
Would love to see decklists :)
I've waited in a queue for hours and this is what I get once I reach the front...   Any ideas people? I can't even use the "ESC" key.  http://imgur.com/257qVod
