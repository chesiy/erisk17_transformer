Holy... Shit...
Intense.
Smelling salts, huh... smooth, guys. Smooth...
I have never thought of this before! I always wanted to try and do some research on what really happened to my friend, but I never knew where to start. Thank you for giving me another theory to work on. This incident is something I'll never be able to forget, and something that I hope to solve, thank you.
The Jump   Look, I still don't know what happened, but for years it's haunted me. Keeping something inside your head as scaring as this is like having a lion in a rusted, old, creaky cage. At one point, you have to tell someone or that cage will break and let something dangerous come out. So here's what happened, or at least to an extant.  When I was twelve, me and my friend, Pat, wanted to try "The jump." "The jump" was this infamous legend passed around the school that captivated every kid who heard of it. The legend was that if you and  anyone else with you at the time jumped off a certain cliff and called out "catch me!" someone would catch you right before you fall. The thing about the legend was no one knew which cliff along the river was the right one to use. Almost every kid in my school had tried and failed. The assumption was that they had all picked the wrong spots, but this only motivated kids further to find the right cliff. I, at the time, thought it was something made up by a student at my school to scare others. But that didn't mean I wasn't a little captivated myself.  One day, my friend Patrick came running to me with this excited look on his face and told me, "Matt, I swear to god, I found it!" Patrick was always a little infatuated with this tale, and as a result of this, he had wanted to find the real cliff ever since he heard about it. He continued on by explaining how he over heard his parents talking about a cliff where someone had died.  "It's got to be the real thing! Someone died there! They have to be the ghost that catches you before you fall!" Pat exclaimed. I was curios, so I decided to tag along and see the cliff that Pat was so sure about.  Now, before I go any further, I need to explain that this is where things got strange. This is the point where I cannot for the life of me explain as to why these things happened. I wish I could, maybe then I could get closure.  When we got there, I could feel a chill down my spine, the uneasiness in the air, and felt as if I had stepped directly into another dimension. But all that was topped off with the drop from the cliff. Even as a twelve year old, I knew that the fall would most likely kill someone. With all of that into consideration, it was Pats enthusiasm that really got to me. I knew that this whole time he had doing the jump in mind, and after seeing the hell-bound fall, he looked all to ready to just fall a good few miles down to his death.  "Pat, are you crazy!? That fall will kill us!" Pat gave me this confused look and said, "What in the world are you talking about? Sure, it's a good few feet, but kill us?" He then continued with a hint of laughter and legitimate confusion, "I think you're the crazy one here."  I was shocked. Pat was always a down-to-earth, smart, and sensible kind of guy. His answer was a slap in the face to me. A few feet? No way in hell that this drop was a few feet. I didn't know what to say, and before I could get any words out to Pat, he turned to face the cliff.   "Come on!" he said, "We gotta do it together!"  I couldn't. I was scared and could feel my mortality tugging at me. I shook my head and quietly said no. Pat still looked confused and started to even look a little worried for me.  "I'll tell you what, I'll go first and then you can see for yourself if it's okay or too much for you." He then took a good run and jumped.  I ran as fast I could to catch him, but I was just to far away to get to him in time. He yelled "WOOHOO!!!" as he took the leap. It only took three seconds of him falling until he broke out into a horrid scream. I saw him flailing his arms and legs all over in protest until he reached the water. A defining splash sounded out silently as if two hard rocks collided with each other. I knew for sure that the fall had killed him. There is no way he survived from a drop that far down. I didn't cry, I didn't fall on my knees either, I just ran as fast as I could.  I kept running in a full on sprint through the woods. I didn't care about the bushes that scratched at my legs, or the low down branches that whipped my face, I just wanted to run away from there. But out of no where, catching me completely off guard, was the most terrifying thing I have ever heard. It was screaming. It was the loudest, most helpless scream I have ever been able to experience in my life. This literally sounded like the act of murder being committed right in front of me. I kept running and running until I made it out of the woods. When I finally did make it out of the brush, the screaming slowly faded away.  I have never told anyone, not even the police about what happened. Patrick was declared missing, and I somehow grasped tight onto my secrecy of what really happened to him. You have to understand, I was so scared, and I still am today.   Years later, here I am writing this out in hopes I can find at least some closure as to what really happened that day. It's just that... Out of everything that happened to me that day, It was the look on Patrick's face that has haunted me the most to this day. He looked So... Excited.
The Haunting - Absolutely awesome.
Thank you.
I really enjoyed reading this and found it to be really well written. Overall, good job my friend! :]
So, ya... um...   This subreddit has been up for awhile now. You see the thing is that right after I made this I found out about the subreddit uplifting news. Now I'm sitting here feeling dumb for making this. You see that rules bar to your right? Ya, about that, no rules. Bye rules, I loved you. You can show your humanity by doing what ever the fuck you damn well please here or anywhere else on Reddit and face the consequences. The thing about here is there are no real consequences I guess. Just don't go way mother fucking over board. God, It's like when I was in grade 11 science and tech class and everyone in that class drove my teacher insane... Literally. So, fuck around all you like on here. Enjoy!
Mom, what the fuck?
Every party everywhere needs this man, right now, this instance.
Cozy?
Hello 60 year-old woman. Meet my friend, Shotgun.
Jeez, that is really creepy. Working around drunk people who pass by all the time gives me the impression you have enough story ammunition for a 12 hour party (get together, etc.) . But I'm glad your safe and that it all seemed to work out in the end... Just hope he doesn't come back.
I'll get back to you on that one. I'm busy digging a hole right now :D  ... For flowers... (ya, that'll fool em)
How do you teach a dog to play dead?   Bring a shotgun
