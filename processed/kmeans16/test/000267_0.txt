I'd do a lot of the same things I'd do with a duck, it being a fatty bird. The last time I cooked through an entire duck I cooked the following:  Rendered Duck Fat (to make anything you'd need fat in--eggs, biscuits, etc) Duck Confit (shred off the bone + add to whatever--you can even make nuggets :) or a shepards pie style dish ) Pate Broth

you know it! I actually only lived in Seattle for a year but it's still a near and dear place in my heart
I made my first sausages from scratch! (an Armenian sujuk)

I remember reading 'Local my senior year of high school so maybe it's just my anticipation to live in NYC fading. I miss the hyper active comment section though... no one comments on the new articles with is a bummer

it is a great read. but of course if it's too long, just get a high res image of Bosch's "Garden of Earthly Delights" for basically the same content
That's not what I call a magic trick
