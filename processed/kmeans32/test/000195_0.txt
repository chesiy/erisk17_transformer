That's so Ravin!
His mother in law passed away.
Unfortunately for him, there's not really a spot for him on the team. His defense isn't good enough to be a big league third baseman and we don't have a use for another first baseman, at least not as much as we could use another bullpen arm. It sucks because he's raking this year.
There's no way we get two games in today in this weather. I guess it will be the W's and UFC 187 to get my sports fix in today.
My lifting partner went to Swolehalla this morning.   I don't need to tell any of you how important having a good lifting partner is and I was fortunate to have a great one for 11 years. Unfortunately, his health began declining rapidly in the last week. This morning, he entered Swolehalla. I'll continue to lift without him, but I like to think he'll be spotting me in spirit.    Here's a picture I took of him right before he set a PR.   http://m.imgur.com/HMLmOQe
http://imgur.com/a/HHLIp   I'm really just looking for an opinion on these boots. Can they be worn with jeans and a button up shirt if I'm just going out to a bar with friends? Any other suggestions for making them work? I bought these a long time ago, but I'm not a big fan of black boots. I hate letting them just sit in my closet though.
[This]( http://imgur.com/a/HIUPg) is what I wore this weekend for a wedding. First time I've had to dress formally since high school 4+ years ago. I probably won't have to dress formally again for awhile, so I didn't want to put out for a full suit, so I tried to duplicate [this look](http://imgur.com/IbMzgfd). Jacket is from Nordstrom Rack, shirt/tie/pants from a local store, shoes from Ross. Hair product is Murray's Pomade.
RIP OP
A-Rod hits career homerun 659 in the first inning.   He's now 1 HR shy of tying Willie Mays for 4th all-time.   Edit: The game is nationally televised on ESPN. He should get a few more ABs.
I was wondering the same thing. He's also the right fielder and a left handed hitter was up.
I'm literally 20 minutes from the ballpark at my sister's house, but she doesn't get the game, so I'm sitting here, watching Tosh.0, following the game thread.
Retired engineer grandpa was getting frustrated with his new iPhone.
As others have pointed out, we probably wouldn't have won the WS in 2012 without him. Given that that was what he was brought here to do, I think most fans don't regret signing him, and that's just from a baseball perspective. He was one of the best people on the team while he was here.
This isn't a genre or artist I'm familiar with but I've heard so many good things about it, so I gave it a spin today. Can't say I was too impressed. There's a lot going on, but nothing stood out as exceptionally catchy. I might have to listen to it again to make a better judgement.
The guy didn't owe us anything. Boston is a great city with a good team. Let's just be happy for the good years we had with Pablo and even happier that we didn't overpay for him.
I put chicken breasts, a can of beer and some spices in my crock pot on low for 7-8 hours. That way I can shred it and save some for future meals. I made burritos with chicken, beans and cheese. Just wrap them in foil and put them in the fridge or freeze them.     Give /r/gainitmeals or even /r/gainit a look. They're going to be high calorie meals because they're designed for people trying to gain weight, but people in those subreddits love meals that can be cooked in bulk and eaten later.
Definitely northern California.
Police are blocking off an intersection less than a mile away from my house in Auburn. I'm looking out the window half expecting to see the suspects.   Update: Carjacked vehicle reportedly recovered on Riverview Drive in Auburn. Residents reporting gunfire. This is several miles away from the high school, but very close to an elementary school. 2 suspects believed to be on foot.    Update: One female suspect in custody. Second male suspect still at large.    Update: Placer High School is being evacuated.    Update: It sounds like the search is being narrowed to the neighborhood between Placer High School and the American River Canyon. Residents being prevented from returning to their homes.   Update: One officer, Danny Oliver, confirmed dead. His partner was shot it the head. Status unknown.
*"Hunter Pence looks like one of the burglars from Home Alone."*   More commentary from my sister.
Don't let that scare you away.    I'm assuming you know what a parlay bet is, but if you don't, it's a single bet on multiple events. In this case, if the Packers win by 3.5 or more points and the Patriots win by more than three, you win. If either outcome does not occur, you lose. It seems like a reasonable bet to me.    The -105 is referring to the odds that the Packers will win by 3.5 points or more. It's just a way for you to be able to quickly calculate about how much your return on the bet would be. The minus sign means the outcome is favored to happen. The higher the number is above 100, the more heavily favored it is. When dealing with points spreads, the odds are usually right around 100, meaning your profit will be slightly less than your original bet. If the odds say "Even", you will win exactly what you bet. If there is a plus sign in font of the odds, the event is not expected to happen. If something has odds of +115, it means you would win $115 on a $100 bet.
Come on, man. Don't be like that.

Somewhere in the middle of game six in the 2002 WS, I commented about how sad the fans looked. That game and series turned around right there. I'm not doing that again.

I'm on board with this as well. Good pick.
If he had held Belt there, we would have been freaking out on him too. Literally the only way Belt is out at home is if Puig's throw is perfect, and it was.
Depends on what you want to do. For night life, the Gas Lamp, Pacific Beach and North Park are the main spots. The Gas Lamp is even cool during the day and it's within walking distance of PetCo. At night, it's a little showy, but a lot of fun. The trolley runs there, but it stops around 11:30. Pacific Beach is great at night too. It attracts a younger crowd, a lot of bros and hoes. Cabo Cantina will have more 21 year old girls than you'll ever see again in your life. You have to drive there though. North Park is the most laid back spot. It has a super hipster vibe. If you go here, be sure to check out Seven Grand and True North Tavern.    During the day, I recommend visiting a brewery. San Diego has Stone, Green Flash, Mission, Ballast Point and a few others that I can't think of. I recommend Mission. Their Shipwreck IIPA is one of my favorite beers ever. Plus, you can take the trolley to 12th   Imperial, walk there and then either walk or trolley to the game.

No, no, it's "revved up like a douche in the middle of the night."
Are the refs just quicker to throw flags this year? It seems like every game I've watched so far has had a lot of penalties. It really takes the life out of the game.
For a starter to get a win he needs to:  1. Pitch at least 5 innings. 2. Leave the game with the lead. Had Vogey finished the 7th, he would be in line for the win because the Giants scored in the bottom of the inning.  3. His team cannot give up the lead for the rest of the game.
