you pretty much stop flopping around positions long before you get to 55.  That's actually a bad thing. Not that you should flip your position just for the sake of it, but there's also a natural progress in human behavior, and I hope that when I'll be in my 50's I'll still be open to see that's going in the world, what's working and what's not - and adapt accordingly.   I don't see any shame in saying "I used to think like that, but times have changed and I changed my mind". Better than the opposite.
A mistake only a faggot OP will make ;)  Excellent post btw.
This is BS article.  1. If we want regulated markets that protect small investors from doing stupid shit with their money, that's a reasonable and accepted part of the plan.  2. Most startups won't even accept investments of less than few hundred thousands dollars. So it makes sense to limit the investment to "accredited investors".   3. If you do have half a million dollar, and it's all your money, and you really want to invest in some start up despite better judgement, there are easy and legal ways to achieve that.   4. Most start ups fail. You know what else fails? This article. It doesn't mention the hundreds of start ups that go bust and give zero money back to investors, but instead keeps dropping names like Facebook and Linked In.  5. Most of the "accredited investors" are white men, but how is this relevant? It's like saying the Yacht market is blocked to black people. Wealth inequality exists,so let's deal with it. I don't see any added value by putting it in a stock market regulation article.

First post was removed (rule #2), so here's a more decent picture of her. You can search Balai Maria or    for more pictures. I hope this one isn't breaking any rules.
Yep, that's exactly how I do it. I also want to mention that the leftover pulp is great for cooking. You can keep it in the fridge and later add it to many dishes. I also make oatmeal milk the same way (skip the soaking or just soak for 10 minutes).
The movie is an almost 20 years old sci-fi and still holds well today. On top of comedy, action and drama blend there's also great timing and a very nice soundtrack. Not a single dead minute in that movie.   It's also worth noting that it was the second movie Luc Besson directed and wrote in English (after Leon: The Professional, which is also worth watching in case anybody missed it). Great launch to his career.
I think it's much more complicated than that. [](#s "He's being an asshole, right. But he's also a scapegoat, a victim, an outcast and totally depended on their good will. He built trust, and he was able to being an asshole in a personal way.") I think it was written nicely.
It's also not a very easy listening album. Almost no hits. They play Money, Time and Brain Damage mostly on Classic Rock stations. I always felt like those songs became hits because the album was successful, and not the other way around (album sells well because of good songs in it).
Well, people mentioned the bike. I'll add that you gonna need to train for that distance. If you do 30km, double it to 60 (do the same route twice), and then 120km. You'll need to get used to being so long on your bikes, learn your pace, see how you handle water and food (with 30km you don't need to eat, with 100km you most certainly do, or your legs will stop working).
Happy with the result
