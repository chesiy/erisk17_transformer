[Stories] hospital worker's of reddit, what is the most unexplained/ paranormal thing to happen to you?
I think something is off
id say Halloween 5 after, Michael Myers gets shot to shit and such and falls into the river and the old guy finds him and nurses him back to health
i was thinking more along the lines of a show based on the lore of the game as opposed to the game itself
awesome when i clicked the tweet there was no pic still awesome though
just a thought...   what if... and bear with me here, what if wwe is doing the things it does with john cena to anger the iwc?   what if all the superman stuff is to make cena a meta heel, one that is specifically pushed to make a certain fan base angry,  he is over with casual wrestlers yes but that was probably the plan all along, get over with the casual and do what ever you can to anger the smarks... eh just a thought
here are the other ones i have done http://imgur.com/a/GKkv2
