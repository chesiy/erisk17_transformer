Went Ice-Skating for an 8th Grade Trip...   We went to San Francisco for an 8th grade trip and one of the things we did were go ice skating outside in the middle of the city. Keep in mind, I can't skate period, and I remember holding on the the side railing the entire time on the ice as I slowly walked around the rink one time before deciding to get off the ice, regretting the wasted 20 dollars renting the skates. Just as I was about 5 feet away from the exit, I look to my right to see a girl who had seemingly got the hang of skating until, and I shit you not, her skates completely malfunctioned under her feet and let me tell you...there was no time inbetween this chick skating perfectly and her face planting while sliding in the wall head first. Never wanted to laugh so hard in my entire life...I'm going to hell.
That shit is annoying too hahah
Fuck you, Trump.

I liked them too, but since the fanboy-dom died down in me since my viewing I can objectively look back and say they weren't up to par with some of their good movies. Ant-Man was good though. Just go into it like its a fun heist movie and you'll be pleased.
When trying to uninstall, it seems like I check the box of a folder that I am SURE I didn't download and that seems suspicious, but when I click uninstall it doesn't do anything. I'll click uninstall multiple times and wait for 10-15 min and still nothing. Checked my extensions and nothing their that is suspicious, just google slides, sheets, and docs.

When did he say that? smells like BS to me.
What Are Quality FREE VST's/Filters/Compressors/Samplers That You Know Of?   I'm looking for quality FREE Vst's. I make Hip-Hop music. Any VST/Filter/Compressor you feel a producer should have please leave in the comments below and a link to where we can get them would be great (not necessary)!  Edit: I use FL Studio.  Edit: Thank you to all who have posted! You guys help me find tons of new things to play with! Some more mastering tools would also be great, I forgot to mention that in the text   title when I wrote it!
I love Murkah, but he's no Wings. Wouldn't you agree the show would be even better if it were Woody, Wings, Kyle, and Murkah. That's the All-Star lineup, doesn't get any better than that.

Where do I begin. I hated the orange filter over the film, Tom Hardy doesn't even talk, they didn't really introduce the setting or environment for those who have never seen a mad max film before (like me), the conflict at hand was sort of confusing, they drive for about an hour in one direction only to drive back, their were probably more explosions than words spoken and dare I say that the transformer movies that people shit on had more of a story and coolness factor than this movie, they want to see the green place or whatever the fuck but you see the grass on top of the pillars in the beginning of the movie, this movie could have been over in 13 minutes had they seen the grass on the top of the pillars, OHHH and if the mass majority lived without water and power why the fuck don't they revolt, how did the world become the sahara desert, what is the world like on other continents, and lastly the story was absolutely non-existent which kind of pisses me off and I am not hard to please when it comes to movies, but this is one of the few movies that I've ever truly hated and it disgusts me that people drool over it and honestly demand more movies like it.  TL;DR: Mad Max is garbage. Don't get sucked into the hype.

I thought you were correcting my spelling, but it was correct and I just didn't know what you were trying to convey. Good day sir.
Dude, worse could have happened, trust me. Just wait about a month and no one will ever remember that you said that. It really wasn't even a scumbag thing to say in the joking atmosphere. Don't worry about it.
If you have 1 video and split it in to like 8 videos, but get a fourth of the views of the original on each of the 8 videos he'd still be making twice as much money.
What Are Your Favorite Heist Movies?
I'd keep my lights off so that he/she doesn't have an easy time looking inside the house from outside.
They've talked about this before but it was a guy who payed something like court fees or maybe a ticket in pennies. Don't know what episode sorry :(
Get off your fucking phone in the movie theaters! I don't give half a shit if you so much so desire to snapchat that you are watching Jurassic World, hoping on the inside that your friends are jealous that you are having fun.
Thank you so much for this post!
Simple Kick on every fourth beat, a oldschool hat, and a clap. Not my genre per-say (  I'm 16) but its just a simple drum loop over a sample. I could re-create it in like 2 minutes. Sorry, but I don't know what exactly you are asking.
