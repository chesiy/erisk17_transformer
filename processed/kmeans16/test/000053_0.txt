Hm, probably have man hands on that keyboard.
I've read what you had to say, re watched the video and you're right, he did point to the side walk area.  I stand corrected.  I don't know if he was necessarily deliberately getting her out of the view of the camera or if he simply wanted to deal with her off the roadway.  Either way, you're correct, he told her to go over there.
I've a 2400 sq/ft home natural gas furnace and finished basement with a 5th bedroom.  Two Tennant's in my basement, I'm single and 3 kids 50% of the time.  March $150  April $130  May $126  June $118  I am on gas equal billing, so I pay $87 every month.
Did you know you can't grow a weed free lawn without chemical herbicides and regular watering?  So screw it.  Let the weeds grow and my days of toiling over that little patch of grass and spending hundreds of dollars are over.  I have a Japanese lilac tree, columbrian maple tree and a hybrid Apple tree + 3 pyramid cedars + 2 lilac bushes, one of which is a beautiful 10 feet tall.    That's plenty of oxygen.  My kids play at the park.
Murder? Based upon what?  Do you have access to all of the evidence and witness statements?  I've the distinct impression you've made up your mind, despite not having access to the totality of the evidence.
What are they protesting?
Empty?  No.
Longer hugs.
Negligent.  Losing track of a loaded magazine is negligent.  Negligence;  ' Is a failure to exercise the care that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in like circumstances.'
You wouldn't believe them anyway.  You know it.
It wasn't always this way.   Seriously, Ive been online since 94. ( interesting you chose that year)  Things have changed and in cases related to disagreement, not for the better.    You can't disagree with popular sentiment on Reddit, else you'll be insulted, ridiculed and cursed at.  It's pretty strange, as people don't act like that in real life.
In Canada,( where I live) the courts have ruled there is no expectation of privacy in our yards.  Else your neighbor would get arrested for looking into your backyard.  I don't believe cops jerking off in helicopters is a reasonable concern.  To answer your question, you have zero expectation of privacy on city streets.

People cheering on those who would make Death threats in response to provocative and robust speech should hold their heads in shame.
I'm happy to see that the police investigated themselves, prosecuted him internally under the PSA, convicted him and then fired him, which was upheld by the OCPC. ( Remember these cases when Canadians claim cops can't investigate themselves)  There **should** be a mechanism in place to suspend officers without pay on a case by case basis.  No such mechanism exists, so dirty and corrupt cops get their top base salary of 90K while they work their way through the system.  So, the government needs to legislate this power, that is currently unavailable to police Chiefs.  The Ontario Association of Chiefs want the ability to suspend with pay on a case by case basis.
You can still carry concealed.  By your silly argument, every business in Canada is regularly shot up by armed bandits, what with our strict gun control laws and all.
