Be polite but firm. If they ask why or wont do it right away, remain calm and repeat, I want you to put me on your do not call list.     Its illegal for a company to keep calling you if youre on this list. Unfortunately, it is not illegal for charities or political parties. But most of those run seasonal campaigns, so at least your lead will be put to rest for three to 11 months.
