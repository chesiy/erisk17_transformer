'Brazil' and its hidden messages. Could someone elaborate ??   I have been always pondering about the movie for a long time now. This is what I always thought about the movie :   The country in which the movie takes place is a mixture of both the United States and Germany. Sometimes, the movie hints at Germany and sometimes at the United States. Let's start of with the main character - Sam Lowry. He is a normal guy. Who wants a normal job. He loves old music. But, Is always unable to listen due to the government poking their nose in his affairs (Stasi reference maybe ?? ). Then, there is the infamous Flying scene where Lowry is trying to save a damsel in distress. But, he is constantly being stopped by forces such as huge walls (Berlin Wall maybe ?? ). There is a scene where a bomb explodes in the restaurant but the people seem to be going on casually after it explodes showing how they have been brain-washed by the government to believe that everything is okay (Censorship and prohibition of free-speech.)   Sam Tuttle (De Niro) represents whistle blowers and the group of resistance who always oppose the Government. He always points the common people in the right direction.  Could someone tell me if I am interpreting this the wrong way ?? How did you feel after watching the movie ?? What do you think the movie is about ??
What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little pleb? Ill have you know that I have the /r/movies's favorite poster flair, and I lurk frequently in /r/truefilm, and I've watched all 250 films on the IMDB top 250 list. I am also the biggest fan of Christopher Nolan. You are nothing to me but just another pleb. I will downvote you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, pleb. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of reddit mods and you will be downvoted and banned swiftly, PLEB. Youre fucking dead, pleb. Not only am I extensively trained in reddit downvoting, but I am also great friends with /u/girafa , you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little clever comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldnt, you didnt, and now youre paying the price, you goddamn pleb. I will downvote fury all over you and you will drown in it. Youre fucking dead, PLEB. [OC]
**Interstellar**.   Nolan made it in 1999. But, thought that it was too advanced for the public and believed that it would be snubbed. So, our savior has time-travelled from 1999 to 2014 to show us this gem of a movie.   Hope It won't be snubbed in the 2015 oscars. Seig Heil.   P.S I'm in 2012 . Browsing Dank Memes. Brb.

Although Al Pacino and Sean Penn have not starred in good films in the recent years, they did some landmark hollywood films in their prime. Al Pacino has The Godfather Trilogy, Scarface, Carlito's Way, Serpico, Heat and many other great movies. Sean Penn is a bit of an inferior actor compared to Al Pacino. But, has directed some great movies and also has starred in classics like Mystic River, Carlito's Way.   Well, Bruce Willis on the other hand is a bit of a wild card. He can really shine in movies with good directors. But, seems to be having a tough time finding a good role in the recent years.
Never heard of this movie before, trailer seems good. Gonna give it a try.
