My idea is for a meta film of Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin trying to get Coneheads 2 off the ground.  It explores issues such as crowd-sourcing, product placement (in a different way than how wayne's world did it marvelously), aging stars, new forms of comedy, CG vs props, Aykroyd talking up his Oscar nomination, who really has clout in Hollywood, Lorne Michaels as a gatekeeper, Curtin's built up resentment of Akyroyd for the ignorant slut joke,reboots vs remakes vs one last final hurrah, rights to the characters, etc etc.  It doesn't really start with Dan and Jane wanting to do the movie, it just kind of blossoms over time and they ride the wave, attempting to get off the wave from time to time, etc.  There would be multiple scripts for the Coneheads sequel, and about 3/5th of the way in, it would get even more meta as all of a sudden the projector would screw up (kind of like the muppets movie) and we realize that the Dan/Jane movie is a movie within another movie that we're watching about trying to get a movie about Dan/Jane making Coneheads 2.  And the producers having problems with marketing that film and reshoots, ethics of using unused Farley footage, and what is too ironic/complicated, etc.  I would have story and screenplay credits as well as an executive producer credit.     Edit: Spelling and whatnot

Best places for scallops in the Indy area?
Make Me An Offer! Name someone you're willing to trade from your team, and we'll reply with offers for that player.   So you can be a Browns fan and say Johnny Manziel (QB), then others with reply to you with offers from their own team.  Perhaps there will be counter offers or 3-way trades that require representation from other franchises?  Who knows.   You can trade multiple players, draft picks, coaches, mascots, whatever.  Just will be interesting to see what we think assets are worth.   Keep in mind, if you're including players/assets that others might not know too much about, please provide information about them (position, years in league, stats, highlight reel)   Have fun!  Edit:  Fixing what needs to be fixed.
Serious question: How do NBA players deal with needing to use the bathroom during a game?   Obviously half-time would be a relieving endeavor.  But what if they need to drop a huge deuce in the middle of the 3rd quarter?  Do they send in a 6th man and go to the locker room?  Do they train their digestive system by eating at certain times?  Or are they all iron colons?
Who is the biggest NFL fan you know and what have they done to earn that position?   Humorous fat jokes are allowed, but looking more for stories, habits, feverish depression after a pre-season loss, etc.

Which are the best buffets, brunches, and/or all-you-can eat places in the Indy area?   There are some obvious gems like Sushi Club, Edelweiss' buffet days, Spice Nation, etc.  Curious as to which others you guys know about, love, etc.  Edit:  Feel free to share pertinent details such as what they offer, if only certain days/times, if it is all-you-can-eat, vegan, price, etc.  (if you happen to know them)
Which facts and opinions about your team would piss off your fanbase the most?   Feel free to back up your facts with evidence.  Feel free to back up your opinions with facts and evidence.  Be honest and have fun!  Edit:  Your facts and opinions can 'depress' your fanbase if you want as well.  'Piss off' is just a suggestion.  Looking for negative emotions.
Who would you like to see play QB for one NFL game and why? (caveat: They cannot be an NFL quarterback.)   They may currently be in the NFL, a star Point Guard in the NBA, your parents' mailman, one of the Olsen twins...  Doesn't matter.  Just pick someone who isn't an NFL quarterback and tell us why you'd like to see them play.  Edit:  Feel free to pick the teams that play and describe what you'd think would happen.

How forgiving are NBA rims?
What is the worst thing you've ever done at work?   Something you did by accident, did on purpose, were told to do by your superior, have to do daily, etc.  Just the worst thing you've done at any job you've ever had.  Doesn't have to be work-related.  Just something you did 'at work'.  Edit:  Quite the overwhelming response!  Made me realize what a model employee I am, though still searching for a full-time writing position.  Maybe I don't have a scandalous enough work history to be hired yet.  Back to applications.  Thanks for the thousands of laughs, gasps, and cringes.
In the famous ellipsis cut of 2001: A Space Odyssey, why do you think Kubrick chose not to line up an angle of the bone which matched the nuclear device in the cut?   As you can see, when you slow down the scene and/or watch it frame-by-frame, you can see the angles do not line up, which could have easily been done with a few less frames.  Since Kubrick was a known perfectionist and quite in control of every aspect of his films, it would seem he purposely ensured they were not lined up. (Perhaps to symbolize the road of technology was imperfect?)  What are your thoughts?    Scene:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtbOmpTnyOc    Gif of cut:  http://stream1.gifsoup.com/webroot/animatedgifs7/4140844_o.gif    Great interview with Dan Richter (mime who portrayed the lead 'ape' named Moonwatcher) which explains the genesis of the cut: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLcRI9nS-Xk    (And yes, supposedly that's a nuclear device and not a communications satellite.)
[Request] Tia Carrere in Wayne's World's Camera One/Camera Two Scene   I think it's one of the more beautiful/playful/romantic shots.  Just her smiling and laughing going back and forth.  Here's a clip I found on youtube, though there may be better clips online or perhaps you have the DVD.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74M0hPAeFHs  Grazie!!!

Yup, I'm great.

Girlfriend told her friends that I'm hung... now our relationship is suffering.   My girlfriend told all her friends how well-endowed I am, and now several of them are being creepy, hitting on me, and doing other things which are hurting our relationship.  She's usually very shy, hadn't been with another man before me, and told them during a friend's bachelorette party not thinking my size was that big of a deal.  Some sort of bacherlorette-based Truth or Dare game.     She's really embarrassed now and thinks she's ruined the relationship with me and with her friends and questions her friendship with the girls that have been forward with me.  (I continue to tell her that she did nothing wrong and that the friends that are hitting on me cannot be her close friends if they continue to do this.  You cannot be friends with those you don't trust.)  I can tell it's really affecting her view of our relationship.    Any suggestions on how to reassure her?  She's convinced she's ruined everything and feels really uncomfortable around her friends and doesn't always enjoy being affectionate with me anymore.  Edited for clarity.  **Edited a second time to underscore to all those who are pm-ing me asking me how big I am... how pathetic your attempts are.**
