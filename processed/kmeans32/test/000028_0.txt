Pulp Fiction

Wine enema.
I live in Lebanon so nothing is ever available in my region. What  I did (and this works for my google chrome browser, not sure if it works for anything else) is install this thing called Hola! that helps me browse from other countries. I just tried it with the NPR website and it worked. But you should really count your blessings at least you have a chance to see Tame Impala live in Australia. Hope this helps.
ELI5: How does binary work for letters?   I know how to represent numbers in binary but how are letters represented in binary?
...thereby demonstrating his value?
Lemons! Burning candles, weed, some trees after it rains.
I was LOLing the whole time because I was imagining a girl who loves dry, barren lands not delicious pastries but in all seriousness: be honest with her, that's what I like people to do with me. I don't think she should have taken advantage of you at the bar when you met, I met a guy at a party the other day and he clearly had beer goggles and although I'm not unattractive I took it as my responsibility to set him straight, as should everyone who meets someone who is clearly drunk. Morals.
No idea sorry, can you try Shazam-ing it?
Alice Cooper - Is It My Body, The Rolling Stones - Shake Your Hips
Absolutely. Ringo Deathstarr is doing shoegaze quite brilliantly.
Honestly you can't hate on Ariana Grade for her song Love Me Harder. It is a great pop song, especially the production. But while you're on The Zombies, Time of the Season is amazing. The Beatles' I'm Only Sleeping is great. Honestly my definition of pop is pretty fluid it kind of merges into indie if you're going into the 21st century, in which case I would recommend The Virgins' debut album.
If you like indie check out The Virgins, they have some very catchy tunes. If you like 80's or 90's real alternative Teenage Fanclub is great (I Don't Know and Don't Look Back are my favorites). But if you want something more current check out Pity Sex they have an album called Feast of Love and a song on it called Drown Me Out. Also Title Fight have a song called Your Pain Is Mine should satisfy your cravings. Please let me know how it works out!
ELI5: How do we take pictures of our galaxy and others?
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Fight Club
The Mammograms with a debut album called Uncomfortable But Necessary
It's not possible to eat something and gain more weight than its weight.   Some law of masses or something. You can't create more mass than you put in.
No. The only two episodes that I know of that Gail the Snail is in are The Gang Gives Frank an Intervention and the last episodes of season 9, which is I think The Gang Squashes Their Beefs. She first appeared in season 5. Mac Bangs Dennis' mom is in season 2 I think.
Beavis and Butthead. Imagine Butthead commenting on the video for Wrecking Ball
LOST.
It's the coolest thing, ever.
How's your butt doing?
OOOOOOHHHHH
BASE jumping!
Okay but if it doesn't change temperature as much as air then why does it absorb more energy sometimes (winter) and less energy other times (summer)?
Sakata Gintoki from the manga/anime Gintama
Rude!
How amazing would it be if League of Legends had characters from our favorite TV shows?   What if LoL had characters from anime like Naruto, Sasuke, Kakashi, etc. Kakashi's ult would be his sharingan and he could send the opponent champion anywhere on the map. Or from Fairy Tail Natsu's fire dragon roar would be his Q. Would take a million years in programming but worth it.
One second. You don't think "justified" and "not wrong" are the same thing? Because I do.
He did quit at one point, when Skylar showed him that huge stack of money.
I can't rank these but I would love to see them on the list.  The Stooges (by the Stooges) was released in 1969. I love how Ron Ashton did so much with like three chords. The bass held its own while Ashton would masturbate for like five minutes and Iggy would sing the most ballad-y song ever. Everyone talks about Raw Power but they forget this album. MBV (by My Bloody Valentine) was released in 2013 and sounds so peculiar and nice. Innerspeaker (2010) by Tame Impala is so ethereal sounding and haunting you have to include it.
I don't think Walter White did anything wrong   I recently watched Breaking Bad and enjoyed it a lot. But the whole time I was thinking about how Walter did nothing wrong. Yes, he killed Jane and orchestrated Gail's murder, but I don't think he was wrong in doing that. Jane put him in a position where it was either her or him and his family. I don't lie to myself and pretend to be righteous, when given the choice, if someone put me in a position where it's them or me I will choose myself. As for Gail, Wlater didn't actually pull the trigger, it was Jesse (not that he was wrong either). Gail was a liability and you can't blame either Walt or Jesse for choosing themselves over someone else. You can't forge a connection with someone and pretend that you would sacrifice yourself over them. I don't know, I've spoken to my friends and no one agrees with me but ultimately the gist of my argument is that we shouldn't lie to ourselves. If we're given the choice to either die or have someone else die, we will choose the other person. It's self-preservation and it's a natural instinct that we shouldn't hide from or be ashamed of.  Edit: when I said recently that was a bit of a stretch. It has been like a year since I watched it so I forgot about the whole killing Mike and poisoning Brock stuff, but I stand by my statement (albeit not as strongly as before).
