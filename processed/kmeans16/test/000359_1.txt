So you have 12 fingers now. Heh
Not as euphoric as Xanax but still good. The only bad thing about them in my opinion is the long half life, so if I take a few too late in the day I'll wake up groggy and still a bit high the next day.
Bang that shit
A few of my closest friends know I use occasionally and if I'm high they'll usually ask what I'm on and I'll tell them H or oxy. If someone else asks I'll just say I haven't had coffee and I'm tired. I shudder when I try to imagine the fallout that would occur if my parents or any of my extended family found out. But that's the nature of these drugs, you have to be able to keep secrets from certain people.
Fake OC 80 pills. Boston area. They contain some kind of opiate, anyone seen these?
1. I had tried quite a few drugs (but not nearly as many as some people on here) before trying opiates. One day I was finally able to get my hands on some 5/325 vicodins. Took 2, smoked some weed and had a great time.      2. The high has a physical aspect to it that just isn't there with weed. No matter how high you get on weed you won't experience the same extent of analgesia you get from opiates. Or the "not giving a fuck" type feeling because of how absolutely amazing you feel from the euphoria.      3. I only use occasionally so that my tolerance stays low and so I can avoid addiction.      4. I would say they've had a negative effect on my social life. I've had to hide my use from most of my friends. It really depends on the person but the guilt from hiding it from certain people can get to you after a while. As for the positive aspect, getting high on opiates is better than every other drug I've tried.      5. I've never binged on opiates since I try very hard to space out my usage.      6. Know that physical withdrawals are the least of your worries compared to the social stigma, monetary cost, tolerance, psychological addiction and even death if you shoot up.
Immaculately written. I had to stop at certain points since I was laughing so hard. Now I'm curious to hear the rest.
Thank you for reiterating this point. The top comments in this thread all make excellent points regarding why the White House is incorrect in their analysis, but at the end of the day it boils down to politics. And given the current situation for Democrats, this means walking a fine partisan line to appease the party's usual voters (and corporations/institutions that support the party), especially as midterms draw closer. It seems to me that it's just one of the unfortunate side effects of the influence of money in U.S. politics.
Thousands of hours into Super Smash Bros. Melee. The competitive scene is amazing and I love going to tournaments.

Depression is unique because there are so many ways we experience it. I am currently in the same boat as you. Most of high school I was stepped on. You just have to keep on living. Friends were a valuable resource when i finally found some real ones. This community is also great because we can let our feelings be known and not feel so alone. Sorry if this post isnt really making a point, I'm just greatful this subreddit is here as much as you.
Use a different operating system...
You're absolutely right about the attitude part. However, the user shouldn't have to choose between familiar/functional interfaces and security (not sure why you called it abstract, do you mean that users aren't aware of how vulnerabilities work?). I use Nightly Linux x86 and first thing I do in the morning is update it, then get on with browsing. If there are multiple updates in one day and it pops up to notify me, I simply press restart to update, wait a WHOLE 5 SECONDS and carry on with my business. Firefox even saves all your tabs for you while you update, so I suppose the point I'm trying to make is why are people so angry about quick updates? My best guess is that the vast majority of users have no idea about major exploits and the consequences of running unpatched software. Feel free to let me know if I'm going in the wrong direction with this though, because what I feel it really boils down to is patience.
All pretty valid points, thanks for clearing that up.
