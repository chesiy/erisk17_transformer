Ayy-oh!
Thanks for the feedback! I'll add this one in as an option.
The top two comments on a tumblr post are always something along the lines of:  * *wow* * *this is fucking thought provoking* * *this is the deepest thing I've ever fucking read* * *truth*  Who are these people
[AU] Gigabyte P37W or P37K   Trying to decide whether the extra ~$400 is worth it to upgrade to the [P37W](http://www.gigabyte.com.au/products/product-page.aspx?pid=5349) from the lead in [P37K](http://www.gigabyte.com.au/products/product-page.aspx?pid=5375). The laptops are not cheap so I am trying to keep it reasonable. I specifically need a relatively high powered, thin gaming machine with internal optical drive at a min 17".  From what I can see, the only difference is the upgrade from a [GTX 965M](http://gpuboss.com/graphics-card/GeForce-GTX-965M) to a GTX 970M in the P37W.  According to GPUBoss, the 970M is up to 35% more powerful, has a larger memory bus and higher clock speed.  Does anyone have an opinion as to whether the upgrade would be worth the extra cash? I'd love some help. Also, please let me know if I am overthinking things and the 965M is perfectly solid.  Thanks!
I love all of garden

I have no idea. It can technically still be used I guess...
Nope. Although I was very careful to remain anonymous, not name names and only paint the event in a positive light. As soon as it went viral new agencies simply scooped up gossip from social media on which it was rampant.
Hi Captainbosspirate,  (1) This was not a Christmas party. This is an annual occasion just to have fun, and to raise money for charity. (2) Partners are invited to the end of year balls.  Please stop having a whinge, it was all in good fun.  Source: I am the OP of the orginal image and an employee of the company.
My office decided to say 'fuck it' today
The situation at Martin Place in Sydney remains an ongoing one, and one from which very little concrete evidence has emerged. In fact, a statement aired on the ABC - "All we know is a crime is taking place" - remains the truest assessment of the events thus far.  And yet, here we are with this - a rushed out special 2pm print edition of the Daily Telegraph containing potentially one of the most vile, deliberately inflammatory, fundamentally wrong and wholly speculative front covers in the sordid history of Australian print media.

I would assume it's because none of then are factors of each other

That would be amazing.

Ahh just the advice I was after! Thanks /u/reallycoolpeople. I was thinking of somehow installing a row of bulbs around the outer mirror and possibly adding a magnifying vanity mirror.

Oh, perfect - that's a big help! Thank you!
Need help buying/making a battlestation for my fianc!   Hi ladies of /r/makeupaddiction! I need your help.  My fianc's birthday is coming up, and I thought the perfect gift would be to buy or put together a make up battlestation for her. I am willing to spend a lot of time on it, and my budget is not really capped.  In terms of advice, I'm really looking for ideas on what features you'd like in your own make up stations and how to go about sourcing the materials. Mirror styles and types, storage zones (make up and jewelery potentially?), shelving, new make up to buy her to include and the physical design of the entire thing. The area I have available is a space of about 2.5m x 1m.   Pictures of your own dedicated make up areas would be appreciated as well as I really have no idea what I'm up against.  You are all amazing, THANK YOU!
No, I don't think he minds to much. He knows anything on Facebook is public domain. It was more of a hilarious shock I think!

Dropped a glass onto a tiled floor and this happened. Can anyone explain?
