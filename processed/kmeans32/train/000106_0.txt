I guess the name Jimmy Saville has to be mentioned somewhere in this thread. Knighted by the Queen, beloved by all and universally praised for his work, mostly with children. He got away with it all his life. Fucker.
You might be referring to the testimony of the watchmen Frederick Fleet when describing the unusual atmospheric conditions that caused them not to spot the iceberg until too late, as there was no moon, no swell and the berg was of dark blue ice (common for icebergs that have recently flipped over) rendering it practically invisible from a distance, however Fleet would say that as it somewhat detracts the blame from himself as lookout.  There are many theories around The Californian as to why it did not come to Titanic's aid, for example that there may have been a third, unknown ship between Titanic and Californian that also happened to be displaying flares, or that Californian did not realise the Titanic was sinking. Both circumstances are extremely unlikely as all crew on the bridge of the Californian admit to seeing Titanic's distress signals and the Second Officer of Californian, Herbert Stone, whilst being question during the inquiry into the sinking admitted that he said to an apprentice "*Look at her* [Titanic] *now...she looks very queer out of the water; her lights are queer.*" Californian's Log book from the night of the sinking mysteriously vanished and all crew acted very evasive during questioning, so no one really knows why Californian failed to act.  Most of my source material here is from the book' Rough Guide to Titanic', so unfortunately I can't provide links, I'm sure all this is on the net somewhere though.
If they are a light sleeper, find/make a recording of the noise the girl in 'The Ring' makes (that weird creaky, croaking), play it on iPod/CD player/laptop so it gets progressively loader. Wait until they are freaking out then either grab them from under the bed or throw six live cats at them!
I was in Pukerua Bay, honestly thought the house was going to come down. Is everyone in the CBD okay??? Still feeling the aftershocks, one is going as I type!!
As it happens I have been round the world 3 times so far, the first time when I was 18 when I travelled alone, self-financed and unaided for 9 months. I was attacked by a cobra in Laos, had a close call with a tiger in Burma, and was nearly mugged in Kathmandu, although was able to defend myself. I have seen more death than many my age and have plenty of experience of the darker side of humanity. And I have never felt the need to carry a gun. Please don't lecture me on how the world works, I don't come to your place of work and knock the sailors cocks out of your mouth do I? Grow up a bit, and realise the world isn't out to get you. If you are not a complete idiot, you will never be in enough trouble to need a gun. If you are that much of a moron, carrying a gun will only put you in more danger than it will prevent. Grow up.
The Universe is either finite or infinite. Either way the mind boggles.
Partially agreed. I felt the film was *in general* very well made and Henry Cavill did a great job, there was just far too much time spent where the film seemed to be saying "look how awesome all this CGI is!", the fight scenes went on forever and were thoroughly disengaging after a while, as well as the fight scene at the end. It just went on without development, i was actually bored by the end. The plot was a little weak and Zod's character could have been much better developed with a little more time, instead we just got a ton of special effects and endless destruction.  TL:DR: **Great CGI Great Film**
This is the only sensible answer I'm afraid. Humanity will continue to search for the answers and maybe one day we will stumble across a new theory of everything. Due to the unlikeliness of physical evidence being found to explain the universe, it may remain a theoretical problem forever.  The only thing that is really certain as that as we continue to research the origin of everything the more amazing and incomprehensible the world around us becomes, but at least we know less and less about more and more.
The moutain in your picture is not Mount Everest, it is an entirely seperate mountain called Ama Dablam. It is in the same range as Everest, but hugely smaller. [Here is a photo I took last time I was there of Everest, Lohtse and Dablam.](http://imgur.com/B4HWHCN.jpg) Note: Dablam was a great deal closer to me in relation to Everest and Lohtse when I took the picture, they are a lot further away than they look. Only the pyramid summit of Everest is visible, and from some angles Everest is roughly pyramid shaped, especially from the east, assuming this picture is a sunrise.  **EDIT:** u/skatelinsy has edited his comment using my picture. This doesn't illustrate his point very well, as only the summit pyramid of Everest is visible on the far left. Lohtse is the peak to the right of Everest and Ama Dablam is on the far right of the picture
Quite a story, thanks for sharing! Do you know who the guy with the dog was in the film?
Wait, the charge of the light brigade was a historical event? I always thought it was a poetic allegory, or Tennyson was using a fictitious event as a moral exemplar for pre-great war british children, not a documentable historical fact.  Also, I hate to be the one to point this out, but if this were an authentic battlefield there would be a lot more debris than just a few cannonballs. Not saying this isn't genuine, just it might be fair to assume this was either a very selective and pre-organised photograph, or it was taken some considerable time after the event.

I'm going to take a guess that you sought advice on circumcision from someone involved in the clergy? I'm sorry to disagree with you but it has been proven by the medical profession that circumcision does not hold any benefit, think about it logically. If it were beneficial for men not to have foreskin, we simply wouldn't be born with it. Evolutionary economy is ruthless, everything evolved on a human body either serves or has served a purpose, surely that is obvious. Also the idea of preventing infection is utterly ridiculous, how many foreskin infections have you heard of? Teach you son to be hygienic, don't mutilate his body. As for sexual pleasure, use your common sense please. It desensitises the penis, that is pretty much the whole point.  As to Mosaic law: Surely the obvious contradiction is why would one God set down the laws for man to follow in one book of The Bible only for the other God to disagree with the laws and use his own for the second book of The Bible. This is meant to be the infallible word of God remember, if you are a Christian.   The idea that forcing such an irreversible act upon a unknowing child makes me nauseous. Why wouldn't you respect your son enough to wait until he is old enough to make such a unalterable choice for himself, in full view of the facts? Why is it normal to do this to children?  I say it again, circumcision has no physical benefit. If it did, we would not be born with foreskin in the first place. Use your brain.
The fact you bang on about 'freedom' and 'liberty' so much, yet have one of the most corrupt governments of any western country, with measurably fewer personal freedoms. Also everyone in the civilised world has sorted out gun control but USA has too many rednecks it seems, but I'm sure that is something that irritates a lot of Americans as well!
"*If anyone comes to me and does not hate his father and mother, his wife and children, his brothers and sisters--yes, even his own life--he cannot be my disciple.*"  "*Take no thought for the morrow*"  "*I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel.*  Stuff like that? Far too many people hold Jesus up as a moral exemplar, the truth of the matter is that the Jesus of the Bible was racist, immoral and tied to wish-thinking and belief in magic. True he is an improvement over the genocidal maniac of the Old Testament, but that is much like saying Stalin wasn't quite as bad as Hitler. No, Jesus was not a great teacher, we do not need his example.
Part of me salutes you for this response as you are, like so many other people have done, bending over backwards to make something that is so painfully obviously immoral into something good. Your explanation of original sin is good, mankind by its very nature is selfish, it is one of the three most obvious products of our long evolution (These being: self-preservation, the impulse for food and the impulse for sex). This helps to make nonsense of the commandment '*Love Thy Neighbour as you would yourself*'. The thing simply cannot be done, the most altruistic, loving person you know would not be able to accomplish such a feat. HOWEVER, though I respect your argument, *this is not an explanation of Original Sin*. Not even close. This is you attempt to justify an obviously immoral practise, for which I do not blame you. Original Sin is the hereditary blame passed down through the male line for Eve's bite from the fruit of knowledge. It is punishment that every human being inherits from the moment of conception for the crime committed by a distant ancestor. *This is not moral*. Just to compound the offence, let us look again at the 10 commandments. The punishment God lays down for making a graven image is: "*I the Lord your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generation*". The punishment of children for the crimes of their parents or grandparents is universally considered immoral today, let alone the condemnation of the entire human race for a non-crime committed, that hurt no one, by a fictional character in the antiquated past. This is, there is no other word, evil. I respect your attempt to square this by granting a different explanation, but by its very nature you can not cherry pick religion.
If I may interject, I don't think an adversarial debate is really getting anyone anywhere, so lets put our pitchforks down shall we?   As to /u/josh_thompson's point about historical evidence of The Bible. I'm afraid he does have a strong argument, there is excellent archeological as well as historic evidence that there was no exile from Egypt, there was no wandering in the desert. There have been many archeological attempts to research these topics, all of which overwhelmingly agree that these stories are erroneous. There are other checkable dates or events in The Bible that have since proven to be inaccurate after careful research, for example the census at the time of Jesus' birth and Noah's flood, for examples. If these stories are true they are checkable and verifiable through a number of methods, and the unavoidable fact is there is plenty of evidence to show that they are not true; they are myths, stories and parables. Now look at other Bible stories such as Abraham's readiness to sacrifice Isaac, or the slaughtering of the citizens of Sodom, Gomorra or Jericho, the detailed commandments on the keeping of slaves. In that light, aren't you just a little glad that The Bible is not infallible?   As for /u/this_to_shall_pass's points about science. You are quite correct, there are many complicated things that science as yet can not fully explain, although not the items you list. The danger comes when we start to see the holes in science and automatically fill them with God. For a great deal of history God was credited with the creation of humanity. We now know, thanks to Darwin, that we have a entirely satisfactory explanation for the existence of complex life, thus God is demoted to sunsets and mountains etc (all of which are perfectly explainable). This is called '*God of the gaps*', and most theists (believers) try to avoid due to its fickle nature. Just because science cannot yet explain something, that gives no indication that God is any more credible, and when science discovers an explanation for a phenomena such as gravity, geology or life on Earth, God is instantly discredited.  As to my own point of view. I look at the world (and my own human body) and I see extraordinary wonder in the complexity and beauty of what we all have. The chance that every human is given at life is precious beyond words because of its uniqueness and finiteness. You will never have a second chance at living this life and there is so much wonder to be seen and had that makes life precious, the most precious commodity there is. The idea that this life is a mere waiting room, a passage to the hereafter (incidentally, if life after death is infinite, what exactly is the reason for this life, or Earth at all?) then that utterly demeans life and destroys its value. Your life is so precious because it will never come again. You only have one chance to make the very most you can of it. Don't waste it.  Please don't think I am being aggressive or argumentative in this response, I felt it might be useful to open a reasonable discussion on this, rather than an aggressive discussion, and I welcome any response that is reasonable.

Awesome! The reason you are being down-voted is you haven't got a Reddit-worthy title.   If you had put "My premature sister's grandmother, who has learning difficulties and no arms, paints these pictures and thinks they're rubbish. What does Reddit think?" = front page!
For those who don't know, this is the Bob Barker, one of [Sea Shephard](http://www.seashepherd.org/)'s four vessels. It is in port in Wellington before heading to the Antarctic to prevent the Japanese ([who spent $30 million of aid given to them after the earthquake to fund illegal whaling](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/14597y/til_japan_used_30_million_of_their_tsunami_relief/)) from illegally hunting and killing whales. All on board are volunteers, and all on board are heroes.
Nope!
Thank you, it certainly was an awesome experience, but instead of envying me, emulate me! If I can do it on such a small budget and at such an age, anyone can! Its is worth giving consideration to, and I would be happy to offer any advice!
Thank you, I don't know you either but you just made me smile!
Nah its not more expensive, it all depends on how you do it! If you are willing to sacrifice **ALL** your creature comforts it can be done quite cheap, depends where you go!  The most remote place I reached was tiny isolated mountain villages in the Himalayas, one called Khumjung and another called Tengbouche, which has a famous monastery. It was a wonderful place to be, the scenery was just beyond imagination, it was breathtaking (literally as there was only 30% normal O2 levels at times!)  Visas are easy to sort out, the only countries I visited that demand visas in advance were India ($60 US in advance) and Viet Nam ($40 USD in advance) Usually just showing up on the border and bribing the border police works (I once had to bribe the same border guard twice on the border between Viet Nam and Laos!) I have a british passport which is still well respected, its not hard to sort visas out. The only thing is if you have an Israeli stamp in your passport a lot of Arab countries will not allow you a visa, so watch out for that!   Language barriers are easy, you simply learn a few useful phrases like hello, thank you, yes, no etc but english is a universal tongue, most people will understand what you are saying if you are patient.  My emigration process to New Zealand has been fairly smooth, although they have just changed the rules, I'm not sure what it's like now. I have a University Degree which makes things easier.
Tough one to answer! I broke a bone in my foot and was stuck in Wanaka, New Zealand for a few weeks on crutches and could not have been happier. So happy in fact I emigrated to New Zealand! If you haven't been to New Zealand, go for the good of your soul, especially South Island! Other than that, I spent some time deep in the Himalayas which was an incredible experience, and northern Viet nam, also an awesome place and awesome people!!
