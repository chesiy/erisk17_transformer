Introspective novels that don't rely on physical conditions, mental conditions, tragedies, or coming-of-age?   I'd like to know if you know of any novels that are introspective where you really get to know what the main characters are feeling, but preferably without someone suffering from physical conditions, mental conditions, or tragedies, or being a coming-of-age story. Ending on an optimistic note would be a bonus.
