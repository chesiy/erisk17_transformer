Many 3rd party dealers offer financing for a fully unlocked device.    Then there is buy now pay later on paypal.     I pay with a credit card and pay off the device over about 4 months and pay less than if I add up   1. never owning the device and changing the software as I see fit.  Samsung galaxy owners just found out about a HUGE hole in the security of the device that samsung had a fix for for half a year.  But they can't get updates past the dumbass carriers.   Security holes are a HUGE cost when that bill comes due.    2. being locked into 24 months of contracts where i cannot switch carriers and bargain for a better deal elsewhere.     The unlocked devices generally support more bands and allow me to switch carriers and still enjoy the full benefits of the network.     And the carrier is not fronting any cost.  That cost is paid by the bloatware companies LONG before you purchase  the privilege to use the device that they maintain control over.  The thing is, you save 200 bucks total cost but you spend that on the contract.   And if the device is 700 new I view this as a 500 dollar loss as I spent 500 dollars to USE a phone...   Where as if I paid 700 I paid to keep the phone and actually have an owners rights to the car.    And not one single auto financing company ever tells you that you cannot service the vehicle or make changes to it yourself, or move to a different state, or refinance the car under a new lender....
My exynos lag never returned.  I use the app switcher pretty heavily.    Chrome slows it DOWN Down down though.     My snapdragon, nothing helped it.  Not turning off talkback... setting animations to 0... nothing.   The difference between my snapdragon and exynos is night and day.    Sure the snapdragon gives me an extra hour and half battery life each day, but it runs like garbage.   I gave up after I exchanged it a second time and still got a laggy piece of shit in return.    This is my last samsung phone.  I love the note 4 exynos... but damn samsung.  WTF!    I would switch to LG but I heard they lock their bootloaders down pretty tight.   Maybe Motorola?  Motorola is like paying a premium price for an upper midrange device.   I don't know anything about how they do their bootloaders now.      HTC got dumb after they released the Rezound.    Nexus devices... ok.. but ZZzzzzzz.  They always seem cheap to me.      Sony is abandoning mobile.   Damn android sucks right now.   Hopefully Ubuntu phone will make gains.  They had a good first attempt.... its not there yet.
Yup.  But, when the dispute is between a woman and a man, the ignorant public will typically judge on the side of the woman.     I don't doubt that more often than not, it was the man that was being overly aggressive... so people just assume that this is the case EVERY-TIME.   I got caught in the trap of that.     As a male I say it's bullshit.   But as a person I just say suck it up and move on because it's a fact of life.  And to remember that an open mind is useless without open eyes.
Me either.  And if I do click I read the headline, photos and captions... then I scroll to the bottom and watch the astroturfers and trolls duke it out on Disqus.  The more extreme or radical the comments in Disqus, the more likely the REAL story is something I should be concerned about. So I then look deeper for information on websites that don't try and sell me one crazy tricks...  Unless multiple reviews of the articles claim it's legit on reddit... I don't bother.  I'm so tired of being disappointed is all.   And the comments on reddit that say it's a good article can't be stupid.  Like "DIS ARTICLE PREACH! CAUSE IT RIGHT!!!"  I coulda stayed on disqus if it's gonna be like that.
Well I know of three people that did it from my time working in a shady lending center. I worked there for 1 month and saw 3 people that did this.    It's not a matter of securing the loan, but what interest rate you are willing to pay.   And if you're gonna do bankruptcy then the interest rate doesn't matter.     This is especially useful to people that are fully employed in the career field they were educated in.  So the income they receive is often more in line with the tuition they paid and therefore easier to lend on.     Even if your credit is shitty, you can get a loan.   While I worked there we routinely took 525 credit score.  And one guy, with a 495 score, received 25 thousand at 23% interest rate.     So, you can always find some shitty dirtback lender that loans out.  These lenders are counting on bankruptcy claims happening, because it allows them to do some tax jiggery applesauce where they still turned a profit.     Our company was a child company of Citi.
Yeah.  I'm 35 now anyway.  I have a ton more responsibilities.    I am happy nothing serious happened to me up to this point.  Probably because every time I left my driveway I wondered, "Is today the day I die?"     So I never rode like a dick.   I knew I could hit 220 mph on my bike like I see these other dudes do.     I knew wearing shorts, a T-Shirt, and flip flops meant with the low weight I might reach 225 before running out of road.      All those dudes laughed at me and called me a pussy when I rode with all my gear on.  Laughed at my defensive riding.   How I treated each car like I was invisible and they were a retard.    Those guys are the ones I see in the pictures here and read about in the newspaper.     I love to ride.  It's the most amazing thing in the world.     Guess I should get rich, buy a shitload of land, and put my own roads on it.
What?   At least under the current system we have some accountability.  We know that Hillary is a stooge and that Bernie has been reliable his entire career.     Just throwing random idiots into office is not the solution to our current problem; which largely stems from the majority of people not voting in every election.    Election day not being a non-working holiday is the root of that problem.
It's a chaotic world.
Well let see... that never happened so apparently what they are doing is working for them.     The point is people are making shit up and misrepresenting the facts.  Whilst ignoring that we do a LOT worse in the USA.
You're lucky that you aren't a slinky. Get well.   [I started thinking about this.](http://imgur.com/gallery/JrM4Cc6)
Look pal, its hot in here... I don't wanna talk. I wanna stand awkwardly or pretend to clean whilst waiting for you to squirt your magic freon juice into those tubes and make this work.    If the silence gets weird, I'll just bother you with more crazy stories; about how it used to could and now it can't.
It's high time we got a dark serial killer movie where Jim Carrey plays the killer.   Agree or disagree idc.    He'd be creepy and dark as fuck....    Edit: And I don't mean a thriller or black comedy.  I mean make it Horror.     Edit2: Turning off inbox replies.  WTF happened last night?  I barely remember posting this. San Migel Pale Pilson is shit beer.  And I hate Jim Carrey.  I apologize for my behavior in bringing this up.    This is like waking up to discover that last night you were the, so-drunk-it's-awkward-guy, ruining the party.
It tellsh me that gooshshtepping moronsh like you should try reading booksh inshtead of **BURNING** them.  Oh wait I'm not in the Sean connery thread anymore.
The smell: Is it fresh and cooking?   Look at the cooks:  Are they clean?    Thats it.      If the food looks 2 hours old and the cook has more dirt on his clothes than the bottom of his shoes.... then it's a true hole in the wall.
I just thought i'd share that someone standing behind me saw the thumbnail to this and said "that guy is looking at big black cocks on his phone."      Thanks.....   My reply "that's texas beef!" didn't really make it sound any better....
Or the nitrogen argon gas... quick... painless.... he doesn't even realize he's going.    Then it's over.  Justice is served.... and no one is getting sick thrills off continued brutalization of another.
