What's the deal with booklice?   I'm not really looking on ways to get rid of them because I'm lazy and am satisfied with just blowing/wiping them away at the start of each reading session.   However, what is with them? They just appear. I read that they are common on old books, so why are they on my copy of The Casual Vacancy, that I bought back in February or some equally dismal month.  They do give me a bit of anxiety though, nothing major, but just the expectation of seeing them as I'm scanning each paragraph. I know they're not harmful to humans but I have a thing with bugs. My main issue is spiders. Just last week I was minding my own and  reading "The Five People You Meet In Heaven" by Mitch Albom in my bed and this spider struts up to me on my pillow, and I recoil. Good book though, sorta depressing but I enjoyed it.  So, yeah. What are your experiences with booklice or other insects?
same
This guy is awesome,  but I think he went a bit too far with sending unsolicited dick pics.  But the satire and making fun of SJWs had me cracking up;  "Did i trigger you"  "You're an obese tumblrina..." etc, that whole section was great.  and then the ending  "The patriarchy is watching ;)"  You played right into his hands and gave him what he wanted: a beautiful reaction.
You're not missing much, it's sticky and moist and gross and... and... *bursts into tears*
Gavin is going to snap one day and just pummel the shit out of Geoff.  Edit: This is the only comment that isn't crying about the video
:(
fuck off man
The women that you date. Are they bae?
Same, really. I've done one year of Uni and it was alright at first, but after Christmas it just become a drag. Now that I'm back home with nothing to do I simply play drink beer, play videos, read, or watch something on youtube/Netflix.  Regarding netflix recommendations, I dunno much about movies, but I watched Sin City 2 recently and it was pretty good. If you're interested in TV shows then Sense8 was a hoot, and I'm currently enjoying Attack on Titan, an anime.
-70 for a harmless joke, oh boy
NO GAVIN?!?  FTFY.
Yeah, well...
Ah right, cheers. Personally I think people are too sensitive over stuff like this, but eh, I'm not the one getting affected by it so I guess I can't really complain much!
NO BARBARA?!
*bursts into tears*
It is.   (See, I can be an asshole too.)
What did Ray say.
**Look Who's Back, by Timur Vermes**  I picked this up because the other book I bought had a "buy one, get cheapest half price" sticker on it and the man at the till recommended it. It's an easy read and I've almost finished it. I'm interested in how the author plans to end it.
If by the audience you mean one dude, then sure

careful mentioning other let's players in this sub  Edit: not that I have a problem with it personally, but I've seen people saying they enjoy the yogscast or whatever, and BAM, downvotes and rage  Edit 2: And my experimental first edit has proven this, mentioning the yogscast has tripled my downvotes. Nice!
Jack is really entertaining in this episode
