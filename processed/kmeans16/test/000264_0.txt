The gay rainbow flag, writes Breitbarts Editor-at-Large John Nolte, is seen by many Christians as a symbol of hate and oppression, and for good reason. Under that banner, there has been an all-out assault by the media and the Left against our religious freedoms.
A Kentucky county clerk testified that she could not issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples because signing the document would signal her approval of a union that violates her religious beliefs. She said that she prayed and fasted for months before reaching the decision.
Marriage Equality in the U.S. Used to Diminish Gay Rights Elsewhere
i'm leaving their comment up because you have an excellent reply, even tho their account was a throwaway. it's not the first time it was brought up, and it wont be the last, so the more often we reply to it, the more little bits and pieces of a rational repudiation of that position gets added to the narrative.
i'm kinda late to this thread, but here are my thoughts.  1) if it's not bleeding too bad, monitor it for awhile and if it still doesnt improve, go to the ER/urgent care(or equivalent) and get treatment for it there.  2) make an appointment with a therapist. please. i dont know the reasons behind your attempt, but i know you were prolly in a really dark place. it's one that a lot of us recognize from past experiences. but the spiral doesnt always have to lead downwards, you have to find a way to change that path. please, please, PLEASE make an appointment with a therapist.
you're human, and a unique one at that. gender exists on a really broad spectrum, and we spend a lot of time figuring out where the hell we land on it. took me dang near 40 years before i acknowledged that i was a girl. i've known since i was 7, but denial is a helluva thing. i was stuck so far deep in the closet that i was munching carpet in Narnia.  dont let society dictate what you can and cannot do. now that's not to say that there wont be consequences, depending on where you live, being creative in your gender presentation might encourage some backlash. but to be true to yourself is the only way to be happy.
you're welcome! it was a very interesting read for me too.
Transgender Rights: The new light of hope!
A state senator from Houston has asked the U.S. Department of Justice ensure same-sex couples in Texas have the right to marry, after the state's attorney general told county clerks they could disregard the Supreme Court's recent ruling legalizing gay marriage nationwide.
June 26th as "LGBT Rights Day" -- A Coda to Marriage Equality That Includes Trans Persons As Well
you're at the inbetweeny stage right now, and that's one of the worst parts of transitioning. EVERYTHING was hard for me and i found myself questioning my sanity on a daily basis. but even then, i knew there was no going back for me. i tried being the boy everybody told me i was. but deep down inside, i knew i was a girl. and deep down inside, i think you know it too, i think a LOT of us know that. hang on, this will pass.  and one thing i know is that you are NOT alone, we're all here for you.
Because I'm not being transphobic. I'm considering everyone's comfort.. Not just the selfish transgender (wo)man i'm talking too  no, you're not, you're basically saying that YOU arent comfortable with trans people. that's it. you do not speak for anybody else.   Simply put, I do not care one bit if you want to go so crazy as to slap on a pair of leggings, a tutu and a bright orange neon thong, prance around and sing I'm a barbie girl followed up with whatever the hell girls do.  and sexist too, nice.   I however do not think you need to be in a restroom where many people expect a certain level of privacy from members of the opposite sex. You are not physically built like a woman. This can cause discomfort to people who are.  again, transphobic. even after i posted the study of all the schools, comprising 600k students where transgender polices are in effect showing that there have been ZERO incidents.  The best response you have to this is to keep saying it doesn't because "there are no recorded incidents" Is a totally dishonest way to debate seeing as there are pretty much no studies out there taking into consideration how the physically male and female students feel about it. At least none that are easily accessible. I can find a grand total of 3 quotes from students forced to share the restroom.  if there have been no reported incidents, then there is no reason to restrict access. like i sed, you have a solution in search of a problem.  I'm misgendering you because you're not even reading a damn word I say and overall being very disingenuous in how you are conducting this discussion... If you can call it that. I don't respect you enough to give a shit what you think you are at this point.  so basically you made up a reason for misgendering me. gotcha  like i said, there are none so blind as those who cannot see their own privilege or transphobia. just like the fundies.
nope
rule 2, please be respectful and civil and dont use slurs
yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeup
i'm a godless heathen, it's the religion's followers i have a problem with, especially when they influence legislators to enact laws to restrict my rights
