i just want to say this.    Don't give up on the b2gdroid platform.   it has a HUGE HUGE potential im totally unaware of but i know it exists.   Yes, its not bug-free but please continue to develop and erase all the issues.    I was instally in awe of the UI on b2gdroid; and its very very good on usability and friendliness.    Keep developing!    Once its ready launch it on the playstore as an homescreen alternative and take-off from there!    One Major issue- battery drain. Please fix that. And if rolling nightly releases are available things will be much better for tester's.
:D
if im not wrong - YouTube is html5 by default now;   Mime Type: video/mp4; codecs="avc1.4d401e"   DASH: yes (134/140)    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLQK9la6Go   ^ this is an indicator of html5 playback    Why dont you try clearing; cache and cookies related to YouTube and see if has any effect.   I hope you don't have any add-on that has forced flash to play.
goto about:config and set these to true:    media.mediasource.enabled   media.mediasource.format-reader.mp4   media.mediasource.mp4.enabled   media.format-reader.mp4   media.fragmented-mp4.enabled   media.fragmented-mp4.exposed   media.fragmented-mp4.ffmpeg.enabled   media.fragmented-mp4.gmp.enabled     Set this to false: media.mediasource.webm.enabled  Verify @ youtube.com/html5    webM(under development)   If somethings are missing from the ones listed here its okay; and i feel ignore_codecs is no longer necessary. Things work pretty good on my end without it
Yesterday you said tomorrow :(
webM is under development. Its better not to enable it, unless you want to provide bug reports.     You'll need to have these set to true to have different quality:   media.fragmented-mp4.exposed; media.fragmented-mp4.ffmpeg.enabled; media.fragmented-mp4.gmp.enabled    Verify your settings on www.youtube.com/html5
For me it all 'just works' works now.    My initial install only involves partitioning and hitting next-next-next on the installer screen.   Its really a breeze these days.   Graphic card is the only addition work I do.(windows also requires nvidia drivers)    Since nvidia is going for optimus(Hybrid cards) i use the bumblebee package; for other nvidia cards a package from RPM fusion is all it needs.   Fedora 22 pretty much identified everything on its own wifi, camera etc. Hell even my wacom tablet works - plug and play style.    The other fine tuning i do which isn't system level stuff is install vlc, freetype-freeworld(for MacOS like font rendering) and apps like MyPaint, Krita, GIMP and Inkscape for drawing and Blender for 3D.    Have VirtualBox also incase i need a Win environment within Linux for testing and Wine for some stupid windows only apps(which i rarely use these days)    Have another system with Ubuntu and it works great as well :)
And if they decide "fuck it. Not worth it" then what? What can Mozilla do them?  Probably court i guess. Things like this might have a legal background.     I understand your frustration. No one with good tech knowledge wanted DRM on the web, but there was no viable alternative at that time too, even now.    Plus one for-good; do-good organization standing up against behemoths of the industry can't win the fight, its quite obvious.    Problem is normal people don't care about ethics and whats good for all as long as it work. They are willing to sacrifice privacy, good-will etc. as long as "it works"    And yea Mozilla still maintain its anti-DRM stance with a non CDM verison of firefox. So up to you as a user to suit your needs.   They dont force you and you still have a choice.
a last test could be to clear cache from recovery or rebooting into safe mode and coming back to normal mode.   Caution - you may have to re-login into some apps
Valhalla Awaits :D   Edit:  Tried it out and i love it! It works fine as well as the gtk2 version for me.   Looks pretty neat on Non-Dark GTK themes.    Few Issues:     * There are few readability issues on the Dark Theme versions(Numix; Adwaita) on GNOME like the drop down boxes on booking.com and initial loading of google.com shows the search bar as black before turning white.     * I wish we could get rid of the BIG FAT title bar, but HTitle add-on is quite the savior.   * And in "Get Add-ons" there is a big white space at the bottom  * Amazon tab keep stopping and showing the spinner every second before it completely loads.    * Scroll bars disappears on booking.com drop down boxes while scrolling from bottom to top - Date; Month.    Typed the edit on gtk 3 :D
i hope my aero knowledge helps me here...   That paint will give give a better picture of real world conditions.   Wind tunnels have streamlined flows and is limited by the model size and wind-speed generation.   when you have a car testing out on a track you'll get more accurate flow patterns(especially turbulent nature), i hope they record the footage because that's the way you can infer the data you gain.    For eg. on the front winglet side below CNN [3rd pic](http://imgur.com/a/CwxBt) you can clearly see the 3 vortex shapes   2nd pic - a good part of airflow is going into the side vents
i think MS is quite happy with its ClearType Tech. Its sucks on the desktop for me but i do like it on WP. Very Crisp and sharp.    The Font scene is patent ridden. We would have had better than Apple level font rendering on Linux and elsewhere but sadly some patents still [remain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpixel_rendering) and hinder progress.    But as always workarounds are possible on Linux with:   [Infinality](http://www.webupd8.org/2013/06/better-font-rendering-in-linux-with.html) and [Freetype-freeworld](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fedora/comments/12jetj/you_dont_need_infinality_for_pretty_text/)  EDIT - ClearType + DirectWrite from Win 7 onwards
Please do try using safe mode and browsing for a while and see if that makes a difference.  If its fine then one of your add-ons is the likely problem source.    You could [Refresh](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/refresh-firefox-reset-add-ons-and-settings) your browser. Warning you'll have to reinstall your add-ons.    Create a SEPARATE new profile and see if that works out for you OR back up data and move it to a new profile.   https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-firefox-profiles
Technology wise - yes, i believe it will atleast by the next few version Firefox will come on par with things already implemented by chrome and go beyond as well.     We need Mozilla and Firefox to exist for an open web, even if Usage etc. go down, because i don't think anybody preaches/pushes forward an Open Web like Mozilla. We had 'works on IE' before, that got addressed well and now we could see that situation rise again.    Only when people/users make switches can the trend change for the better.    Usage   Adoption - this depends entirely on a persons perspective. If a person feels chrome is the best thing on the planet, then you cant change him/her. Other who have a different ideology, say they value privacy or OpenSource/Standards developed software a lot, then Firefox becomes the best choice for that person.   It really comes to a personal choice and if you're willing to make a change.    EDIT   Non-tech savvy people - they would be least bothered. They just want something that works.   Only way to change them is to educate them or market better(which Chrome is all about).   This is one crowd that has to be considered because for them defaults/ad's and marketing make it the best product.
Dont want to switch it off, i hope it helps in telemetry.   I believe it might be reported since its be ongoing for sometime, trying to bug hunt it down.
Don't Track Me Google, ah just enable it in the settiings/Preferences - Privacy (Do Not Track) - no need for extensions.   DownThemAll - all the way :D and Video DownloadHelper for YouTube etc.   For Search you could use the Search box right next to the Address Bar and add your fav. engine there too!

Ah I'm on nightly   What im saying is without MSE, the playback with HTML5 video playback on Linux is bad, stuttering. With MSE it is better(but yeah bugs are present).
Synfig
can you provide some info on the black bars in Frames?   I dont know if its common to everybody but, hitting next on Every photo in an album on facebook always results in disk activity and also scrolling down the news feed for stories in the past also leads to disk activity.
its so beautiful
The problem is with the open source community is that they too content with what they have, they don't see lack of good GUI tools on Linux a problem because they use the command line anyway  Dont feel that way, we wanted Office, we've got LibreOffice and OpenOffice.  We wanted a alternative to 3ds max/Maya(though maya runs on Linux) we got blender and its going places. Alternative to Autodesk Sketchbook, we've got Krita and MyPaint. Corel Draw/Illustrator - Inkscape, SynFig.   There is an abundance of good software, i'll admit some of these having a learning curve but they are worth the time spent!    The community has never kept quiet, we've kept demanding, its just the commercial bigshots are ignorant, and the community had to figure out its own version of things.
i have a STRONG feeling this is because of the FACEBOOK app.   Even on my old micromax a110 512mb ram device this happened when facebook was installed.    Once i uninstalled my facebook app, phone was butter smooth.   Same thing with the Moto G 2ng Gen.     EDIT - not on the forums. but you could try this out and just report it there to help us ALL!
SwiftKey languages - Indian languages in new Android beta
ah yes i get what your trying to say :)   i have a couple of emoji font installed on my system to help me out.   I just felt this could be better since the user doesn't need to do any-end work
oh okay :)
i've tried all, beta, stable and nightly...but its still present. Hoping it gets resolved soon :)
[TOMT] [video] Internet its been 7 years! Please Help! unknown Candy Trailer Song :(   The song appears in the candy trailer - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrudC0STJ0U   The songs appears at 1:15   Most believe its some unknown Australian Song.   It's not present on the OST.    Few of the words in the songs are:   don't you worry   about the flight yeah   careful and true... we've flown   sing for the way we've grown... we grown
Thanks for the link! :)
I don't see how Shumway will allow Firefox to get users back. Most people don't exactly use Flash voluntarily. They need it because video sites require use of patented codecs (H264) and DRM.  Linux users are fed up with Adobe flash(no new versions-except security updates), and most crashes happen due to flash or some flash based content on webpages. Plus lots of people use YouTube and other video based sites a good part of usage, having something inbuilt and stable like shumway like the way Google does with Pepper, it should probably improve the reliability of the browser.
If the phone has a physical menu button, no menu should be displayed, unless the app has an outdated Manifest (might be the case for Twitter for all I know).    Yeah that's it, the tradeoff between physical/virtual menu button. i feel it'll be best left to the user if he/she wants to enable the 3 dot menu button on phones with a physical menu button.   i feel the most important buttons such as back, forward, refresh should be in a much more easily accessible location on the screen, instead of going through a menu.     And thank you for the mention of gestures- will get an add on right away :D
I've made a newbie linux guide. Hopefully you should find it useful! :)   https://test_subject3336.wordpress.com/2013/09/22/linux-a-newbie-desktop-users-guide/  Share it with your friends, family if you would like to. Peace! :)
