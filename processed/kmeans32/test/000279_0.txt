Yes
OMG I was about to post this!!!!!! Yes I remember wandering into the adult section and seeing that once and it scared the crap out of me. It still kind of gives me the willies when I think about it.
LOL thats funny!!!!!
The Joker from The Dark Knight and im pretty sure I am right too.
I wish I can see her again   So a few years ago I was at a party at my friends house and one of his friends Rachel invited a whole bunch of her friends and we all got wasted or at least buzzed I remember this girl I met Justine she showed an interest in me and all of my buds were telling me I should make a move on her I did and we started making out on the couch I actually thought I was going to get laid but then her friend said she was leaving and she left but she gave me one last kiss on the cheek and said "I have a boyfriend". I was a little upset cause she just used me but I also wish I could see her again I never saw her again except one time on the train when I was going to work I waved at her but she pretended not to notice me. Anyways sometimes I look up her FB profile to see what she is up to, she never accepted my request either. I just wanted to make this known.
Yeah hes still a good actor and I have always liked him, I honestly dont think he can become an a lister again though he is too far gone.
UGH I wish I had seen it in IMAX I was jobless at the time though and by the time I got a job and money The Hobbit had already started playing, to make up for it I saw it in a regular theater in one of the first few rows.
Yes its nice that they got these d list characters in the comics like Guardians or the Inhumans to big shots in the MCU. I cant imagine how awesome it would be to have all of the rights to the characters but honestly they dont need X Men at all its fine in its own universe and the movies are doing great, I only wish that the ff had reverted would have loved to see galactus and silver surfer in Infinity War.
Cool
No
Maybe
Interesting
5 or 6 per week and at least 2 a week in the cinema I also keep track of every movie I watch there I have for the last 5 years.  I like ALL types of movies but my favorites are action and comedy. I like current movies like made in the last 10 years but occasionally I will watch something from the 80s or 90s.  Last 5 were Submarine, Zero Dark Thirty, Selena, Iron man, and The Last Five years.
LOL
cant wait!!!!!   man I cant freakin wait!!!! I have been waiting for season 6 for so long!!!! I will watch it on yahoo screen as soon as it is available.
Thats about right.
I liked it and TBH I have no freakin idea if she is from the future or not.
How bout Bradley Cooper in there for Best Actor.
Thank you
I liked it it was really funny, maybe I should rewatch it havent seen it for awhile.
Man I wish I can rease all knowledge of Star Wars and rewatch them in release order just so I can be shocked at that part.
Yes hes a villain but not really if ya know wat I mean. Plus he tried to call it off too but was too late.
Yeah but probably not.
Its just sitting there noone is touching it sadly I really want to see them too.
AHHHH man I liked this show. Gonna miss it.
YES!!!!!!!
It is awesome nothing can stop it now!!!! I am glad AOS is here that way I can get my weekly dose.
Yes loved that part its good to see Marks threatening people again instead of being all goody goody.
Yeah that would have been cool.
AMEN
Hes not TOO obvious tho most people might recognize his voice and eyes but thats it. He was freakin hilarious in it LOL
[TOMT]Old war movie in desert.   A long time ago I remember watching this movie with my parents about a group or guys who defend a fort or something in the middle of the desert there was the main guy who may or may not have been played b Jean Claude Van Damme. There was also a black guy who gets captured by the enemy and a guy who gets an eyepatch over the course of the movie. At the end of the major battle it is just the main guy and the eypatch guy left, that is all I remember. Anyone know???
