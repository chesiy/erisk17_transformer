You can read up on the CIA at r/TSBD--I highly recommend the 2007 Non-Fiction Book of the Year *LEGACY OF ASHES: THE HISTORY OF THE CIA* by Tim Weiner. It's very well-written with short 10-15 page chapters--lots of eye-popping quotes as well.  EDIT: hmmm...seems like there is something the gatekeepers don't want people to know
Below are two excerpts from [*INSIDE THE COMPANY: A CIA DIARY*](http://np.reddit.com/r/TSBD/comments/30oi1g/inside_the_company_cia_diary_by_philip_agee/) by Philip Agee (1975)...just THINK about how much the CIA and all the other agencies have grown since then--in 1990 there were 11 intelligence agencies, today there are (at least) 17.   ---------  When I joined the CIA I believed in the need for its existence. After twelve years with the agency I finally understood how much suffering it was causing, that millions of people all over the world had been killed or had had their lives destroyed by the CIA and the institutions it supports. I couldn't sit by and do nothing and so began work on this book.  --------------  Even after recent revelations about the CIA it is still difficult for people to understand what a huge and sinister organization the CIA is. It is the biggest and most powerful secret service that has ever existed. I don't know how big the KGB is inside the Soviet Union, but its international operation is small compared with the CIA's. The CIA has 16,500 employees and an annual budget of $750,000,000. That does not include its mercenary armies or its commercial subsidiaries. Add them all together, the agency employs or subsidizes hundreds of thousands of people and spends billions every year. Its official budget is secret; it's concealed in those of other Federal agencies. Nobody tells the Congress what the CIA spends. By Law, the CIA is not accountable to Congress.  -------------
I reposted it because the bankers have been "negotiating" their deals with the SEC.  I think it drives home the point: if you are a banker with millions to spend on fucking attorneys--HEY, no big deal...no one has to go to jail even though BILLIONS have been STOLEN from both the public and private traders which the companies handle deals for.  meanwhile, if you are poor and black or hispanic in the U.S.--you better watch the fuck out because you can be harassed/arrested/killed at any moment.
Intelligence Agencies Are Roaming Reddit--Attempting To Bait You Into Being Banned   my subreddit [r/TSBD](http://np.reddit.com/r/TSBD/) has had the image PERMANENTLY maipulated--that is, I can no longer post an image...(I used to post a political cartoon at the top--I can no longer do so)...The day this took place was 4/17...The [Traffic Report](http://np.reddit.com/r/TSBD/about/traffic/) for my subreddit listed 4/17 as having **1 visitor--with 3 new subscriptions...How the fuck does that happen**???  Now u/shark_shank has been [REMOVED](http://np.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/) from his own subreddit (or has gone on vacation...or deleted his own account)...  DON'T LET YOURSELF BE BAITED INTO MAKING INFLAMMATORY COMMENTS--OR YOU WILL BE REMOVED (SILENCED).  EDIT: If any of the mods remember a post which appeared after the Boston Bombing--it specifically warned of this...I don't remember the user's name--but he/she claimed some inside knowledge and I believe also said he/she was going to quit reddit as well...if anyone can find it, please post. The TRUTH is getting out--and authorities are doing everything in their power to SILENCE those who question the Official Bullshit Stories.

NICE, thanks for posting...  Fetzer seems to go too far quite often--but this slideshow seems spot-on in many areas...Fetzer points out the vans were erased from the background in the Zapruder film.  Once you add in the fact that Col. Fletcher Prouty (and another military big wig) [identified Lansdale in Dealey Plaza](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA-3navQ-_E)--things start to add up...In the video Prouty even shows the letter from the other Pentagon insider (forget his name)...important that it is NOT just Prouty that ID'd Lansdale...
the fucking criminals at the Pentagon and the CIA don't necessarily have to go to war to profit--all they need to do is scare the fuck out of stupid Americans--strike fear into them so they can spend whatever amount of money they want on their bullshit programs--  http://redd.it/21andu  FYI: the U.S. had about 300 nuclear weapons in 1950...by 1960 the U.S. had 18,000 nuclear weapons. (Eisenhower sure did a great job controlling the MIC)  It also helps if you don't submit to an audit: http://redd.it/29fcu5  http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/19/85-Trillion-Unaccounted-Should-Congress-Increase-Defense-Budget
very well written article with some great quotes by former LEOs.  i see the cops literally preying upon the African-American population everyday where I live...they literally drive down a main street from a white part of town, pull into the walmart--so they can check all the license plates...then they wait for them to drive out, pull them over and, cha-ching--more money for the corporate prison complex.   some municipalities actually have parking enforcement drive around and ticket out of state vehicles once they are parked in an area over 30 days for not transferring plates (it might even be shorter than 30 days).  for those who haven't heard: the License Plate Readers the cops use while they are cruising mall parking lots (or pulling you over) will automatically pull up the registered river's info and make different audio sounds for offenses (a cash register opening for a late ticket payment, etc)....dana priest (Wash Post) reported on this in her 2006 book *Top Secret America* (which was mostly focused on the growth of the government/corporate intelligence agencies post 9/11).  ---------
these are some points that i find interesting:  -----  Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-SD) was on the Senate Intelligence Committee stated in a 2002 press conference that [he was asked by VP Dick Cheney NOT to investigate 9/11 "on several occassions."](www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEvpZ8SM9L4)  -----  Press conference of GW Bush after meeting with the 9/11 Commission. Bush was accompanied by Dick Cheney for some unclear reason--they were NOT under oath, no official record was kept...afterwards [Bush held a 5 minute press conference which most likely didn't even have 6 questions...](http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2okmfy/gw_bushs_full_press_conference_after_speaking/)  -----  the Co-Chairs of the 9/11 Commission wrote a NYT editorial claiming their investigation was obstructed by the White House and the CIA...Glenn Greenwald wrote an article in 2008: http://www.salon.com/2008/01/02/obstruction/  ----
I doubt if the frontline doc included Thomas Drake's (et al.) letter--it was released January 2014 or so...  So, in addition to NSA Insiders' claiming the NSA obstructed the 9/11 Commission--we also have the Co-Chairs of the 9/11 Commision who claimed their investigation was obstructed by the White House and the CIA...Glenn Greenwald wrote an article in 2008: http://www.salon.com/2008/01/02/obstruction/  In fact, when former 9/11 Commission member Max Cleland was asked if there should be another 9/11 Commission, he said: "There should be fifteen 9/11 Commissions!!!"  http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2014/07/911-commissions-forum-shows-dc-works-4.html
the CIA has been helping the Qataris, the Saudis, the Jordanians and the Turks to pump in cargo planes filled with weapons into Syria since 2012...came across this article from March, 2013--every once in a while a small dose of truth seems to leak out  http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/25/world/middleeast/arms-airlift-to-syrian-rebels-expands-with-cia-aid.html?pagewanted=all _r=0  furthermore, Liz Cheney (Dick Cheneys daughter) began funding opposition groups in Syria and Iran as far back as 2005  http://prospect.org/article/commissars-town
The U.S. has spent about [$10 TRILLION in total National Security Budget since 9/11](http://www.pogo.org/our-work/straus-military-reform-project/defense-budget/2014/americas-one-trillion-national-security-budget.html) including about $5 TRILLION on the useless wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.   The lies of the Bush-Cheney War Criminals have all been shredded--there were no WMDs in Iraq, there were no Iraqi-Al Qaeda connections. The Bush-Cheney administration claimed Usama bin Laden (et al.) planned and carried out the attacks of 9/11--yet the administration balked when Afghanistan offered to capture and turn over UBL if the U.S. could show proof that UBL committed the 9/11 attacks.   Instead, Bush-Cheney never provided any evidence--they sent in the CIA into Afghanistan with plenty of CASH on hand to pay off Afghan warlords to help hunt UBL in Tora Bora. Apparently throwing millions of dollars around in foreign countries doesnt always guarantee success--so the U.S. military went to war in Afghanistan.   Back in the U.S., the Bush-Cheney War Criminals began covering up 9/11 by asking the Joint Congressional Inquiry into 9/11 NOT to investigate--in fact [Dick Cheney asked Tom Daschle NOT to investigate several times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePOIhhd9Jr0). The CIA, the FBI, the NSA all stonewalled the 9/11 Commission at every turn as well. In the end, the 9/11 Commission co-chairmen wrote a letter in the *NYT* accusing the [White House and the CIA of OBSTRUCTING the 9/11 investigation](http://www.salon.com/2008/01/02/obstruction/).  General Wesley Clark is also on the record stating the [Bush-Cheney War Criminals intended to go to War with 7 countries in 5 years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RC1Mepk_Sw).   I dont know what exactly happened on 9/11--but I do know the U.S. government is LYING and the 9/11 Commission Report was a WHITEWASH. If you havent looked into any of these issues I would urge you do some research--because the USA seems to have become fixated on war.   The list of countries the US has bombed and/or attempted to overthrow the government of since the end of WWII is most likely much longer than you think. Lately, I definitely worry that eventually the world is going to get sick of the US bullying its way around the globe with boots on the ground in over 100 countries. Statistics provided by [Special Operations Command indicate that special forces groups were operating in 92 different countries in March 2013](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/05/authorization-use-military-force-blank-check)
Just look at William Blums Table of Contents page from his book [*KILLING HOPE: U.S. Military and CIA Interventions since WWII*](http://williamblum.org/books/killing-hope#toc)  Most Americans simply are too brainwashed to understand our complicity in so many conflicts (and so many deaths) across the globe. Even today, the good ol U.S.A. has military or covert operations running in at least 132 countries.   Two other excellent books to start out on would be *OVERTHROW: Americas Century of Regime Change from Hawaii to Iraq* by Stephen Kinzer and *LEGACY OF ASHES: The History of the CIA* by Tim Weiner.   In terms of the surveillance state--theres a Frontline documentary called *Top Secret America* (2013) which gives a great look at the rapid expansion of the intelligence sector after 9/11...http://video.pbs.org/video/2365004424/  ----------------  Stephen Kinzer lecture on his book *Overthrow*: http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4499417/stephen-kinzer-talks-book-overthrow-americas-century-regime-change-hawaii-iraq

Why the Senate Torture Report could blow the lid off the CIA     ...the CIAs torture program ended up deceiving the 9/11 Commission. Specifically, the 9/11 Commission Report was largely based on third-hand accounts of what tortured detainees said, with two of the three parties in the communication being government employees. The 9/11 Commissioners were not allowed to speak with the detainees, or even their interrogators. Instead, they got their information third-hand. The Commission itself didnt really trust the interrogation testimonyyet published it as if it were Gospel.  New York Times investigative reporter Philip Shenon noted in a 2009 essay in Newsweek that the 9/11 Commission Report was unreliable because most of the information was based on the statements of tortured detainees.  As NBC News reported:  * Much of the 9/11 Commission Report was based upon the testimony of people who were tortured.  * At least four of the people whose interrogation figured in the 9/11 Commission Report have claimed that they told interrogators information as a way to stop being tortured.  * One of the Commissions main sources of information was tortured until he agreed to sign a confession that he was NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO READ.  * The 9/11 Commission itself doubted the accuracy of the torture confessions, and yet kept their doubts to themselves.  The CIA has already gone to great lengths to cover up the torture  and the unreliability of the testimony published by the 9/11 Commission.  The CIA has blocked release of the Senates torture report for years. In addition, it has taken many other actions to try to keep the lid on the torture program.  For example, the CIA videotaped the interrogation of 9/11 suspects, but falsely told the 9/11 Commission that there were no videotapes or other records of the interrogations, and then illegally destroyed all of the tapes and transcripts of the interrogations.  9/11 Commission co-chairs Thomas Keane and Lee Hamilton wrote:  *Those who knew about those videotapes  and did not tell us about them  obstructed our investigation*.  Government officials decided not to inform a lawfully constituted body, created by Congress and the president, to investigate one the greatest tragedies to confront this country. We call that obstruction.  (And the chairs of both the 9/11 Commission and the Official Congressional Inquiry into 9/11 said that Soviet-style government minders obstructed the investigation into 9/11 by intimidating witnesses. We believe that some of the minders were from the CIA.)  **FULL ARTICLE**: http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2014/03/cia-spies-senate-intelligence-committee-attempt-make-sure-senate-report-finding-cias-torture-program-illegal-counter-productive-stays-secret.html
