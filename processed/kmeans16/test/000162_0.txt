I think it is silicified. I used to live up near there and that stuff is found frequently. This is a more sediment covered piece, but if you find or clean pieces that aren't, it's hard as a rock coral.
Power bills in the $10m range. That's per month. With current processor and system architectures a true exaflop capable machine would -literally- require a dedicated nuclear power facility.

Meanwhile, this is will (sadly) be one of the most popular articles about supercomputing. *sigh
Why Amazon Cant Catch Lucera Financial Cloud
There is a certain sense I get among the supercomputing elite that Hadoop is technology for Web 2.0 companies, that's there's no relevance. It's an unwillingness to experiment. That seems unfortunate because most of their workloads look a lot more like big data analytics (they would cringe to hear that) than they do strict floating point stuff. SDSC is the only real center where development work on this is actually translating into real applications being run...and guess what, they're running more efficiently.

Any HPC'ers Go to TERATEC? Opinions?
NVIDIA is afraid...in this space (at this point for this particular type of large-scale systems that MIC was drawn for). They owned the concept of accelerated large-scale compute but the addition of on-package memory, the ability to swap between coprocessor/plain Xeon is the only thing like it, and they have the x86/programming ecosystem. CUDA, OpenCL are great--NVIDIA GPUs offer way higher performance, but the ease is the real crux here.
Xeon Phi has only ever been a coprocessor, the point here is that it's the first processor ever to do both at the same time. It can do both--and on top of that, be programmed roughly the same way. GPUs or other accelerators require offloading and serious code hassle. When Landing hits the ground there's no more of that--and it all leverages common x86 binaries, etc. -- The 512 aspect is a minor point. A MAJOR point is also that this thing has memory on package--another first. People don't realize what a game changer this is--for users and Intel alike. Right now it's just important for highly parallel applications in HPC--in 5 years, this will be the new face of Xeon. A serious rival to other contending architectures (ARM +GPU, for instance).
Ah--you answered my other questions in one neat sentence there--who is it aimed at. Do you have a site with more details?
It looks like a tiny leg, doesn't it? Nice piece--these are best cleaned up with a stiff toothbrush and warm soapy water. You can "file" them down a bit this way as well and expose more of the crinoid--I have many of these from the great lakes region.

Well, hello neighbor--I am in High Point. Found these in one giant patch of similar thick rocks with ripples and brought many of them home. They were in a MOST geologically strange location--crystals unlike I've seen a couple of (seriously) amethyst points. Never seen anything like it.   These are not stromatolites for sure. Got a bunch of those already--these things are thick, like layers and layers of ancient mud. I will take a few photos in a little bit to give you a sense of what some of the others are with my tiny, tiny hands as scale (ha--seriously).  Love the Pteridinium but this thing would have to be many yards long and there's not enough regularity.  Pics coming in 10 minutes or so of some of my other hunks. Again--weird locale. Amethyst points (2), an emerald, and what appears to be citrine. Not sure what to think.   Okay--off to photograph for you!
An update was just posted a few moments ago next to the older ones. The editors secured a special draft report directly from Oak Ridge National Laboratory and are expected to share full details about peak performance numbers (as confirmed) as well as full specs for benchmarks, application range, processor to coprocessor ratio, memory subsystem and ooo...the interconnect topology. Exciting stuff for the supercomputing world. They note they'll post this around 11 p.m. Eastern or midnight.
