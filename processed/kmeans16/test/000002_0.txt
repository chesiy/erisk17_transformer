That is stupid! I'm glad we didn't have to be as strict about it. I told my manager, it got turned off (suspended?), and it was over
LoL! I don't think my managers and the police would be as forgiving this time of it happened. It would be horrible if it malfunctioned and went off tonight without me touching it. They'd never believe me!
Thank you! I'm working now, and I have no idea if it's working. I'm not testing it though!
The Woman I Never Knew   My life has been quite hectic recently. I apologize if this is all over the place. My mind has been quite *different*. I can't explain what is happening, but I'm hoping you can. I'll start from the beginning. I work at a growing chain of grocery stores that have gas stations attached. I'm normally just a stocker, but my department is also responsible for helping run fuel center. Since the main girl out there went on vacation, I was scheduled to close up by myself. We close at 11 every night. Never early. I expected it to be a great week. After 8, the fuel center dies, and we are allowed to play on our phones and entertain ourselves. I decided to bring my DS and play Pokemon to pass the time. I was quite excited to get so lucky.   Man, was I wrong.   My first evening was going fine, until my co-worker left, leaving me alone. The first hour flew by in a flurry of winning battles and catching Pokemon. Soon, it started. I could hear a woman almost  shrieking, so I looked out my windows to see no one at the pumps. I then look at my camera monitor, but it's blurry. I've never seen it blurry, but I put it off as a glitch. I stepped out to see if maybe I was hearing the song from our speakers outside, but there was nothing. I blew it off as my imagination and continued with my night. Soon, I heard what sounded like someone trying to get into my small office, so I look at my monitor again, and it's acting really strange. It will go blurry, glitch, and then go clear. In the moments of clarity, I can see there is no one out there even though I can hear the banging and knob rattling. I call my boyfriend, and he calms me down. Soon, I have to go out to lock down the machines and other merchandise outside, so I get off the phone and hurry about my business outside. I figured since I had been outside for about 20 minutes and nothing happened that I had imagined everything. So, I close the inside and lock up. On my way to drop off the key to the main store, I can hear a whistling, but there is no one around and the radio had been turned off. I dreaded coming back.   The next day I figured that since I worked with someone my whole shift, and it was during the day, that I would be fine since I had worked it a thousand times during the day. Everything is fine, until my co-worker goes on break. The camera started acting strange again, but there were no weird sounds, so I wasn't too worried. I got up to grab a water out of the back fridge, but as I stood, my radio changed stations without anyone touching it. I walked back to it, and it changed back to my original station. I was freaked out, so I just turned the radio off all together and sat in silence. The rest of the shift was fine.   Then, today was the most intense yet. I came into work already terrified of what awaited me, but I wasn't working alone until the end of my shift. Since things only seem to happen when I'm alone, I figured that I would be ok. Once again, nothing happens even an hour after he leaves, so I think that I'm just going crazy from the social isolation and being alone out in a room by myself. That's when I could hear the shrieking again, but no customers seemed bothered. I put it off as my imagination running wild. It was probably about 10 when I could hear something pounding at my door. I even heard the door open and papers fluttering. I got the courage to look in the back section, and nothing was out of place. I sat with only my phone playing music and looking around at the outside to watch for anything out of the ordinary. When it was time to close up the outside area, I kept getting the uneasy feeling of being watched, and I would catch glimpses of what looked like something in my room. That wasn't possible though. It was locked and I had the only key to it around my neck. I thought that it was only my reflection and hurried to get back to my safe haven. I closed down the inside and started my walk to the store. I got the feeling again that I was being watched, so I turned my head. I wish I hadn't I saw her "standing" in the shadows by the recycling dumpsters. I use quotes because I couldn't see legs on her, just the head and torso. She would have been about 5 foot tall. She had wild black hair with what looked like could have been red highlights, her dress looked like a sack and was dirty and ripped, and her eyes, oh her eyes. They were the only facial characteristic I could see. They were almost black holes. I kept my eyes on her as I rushed back into the store. I dropped the key off and rushed to my car. When I got to my car, I could smell what I assumed to be her. It was a mixture of rotting flesh and old urine. I got in my car and pulled out in a frenzy. I kept looking in my rearview mirror because I thought I saw movement in the backseat, yet there was nothing. No one could be back there because there were two boxes that take up all the room. I get to my parking lot, and I smell the same smell as I'm walking through the alley to my apartment. I then hear steps behind me, so I look... There is nothing again. I bust threw the door of my apartment and explain what had happened that night to my boyfriend. I went to open the bedroom door, but before I got it open, I heard the springs of our bed move as if someone jumped out of bed quickly. I think she followed me. I keep seeing movement by my window. I feel strange. Maybe I'll underssssstand. Maybe I could knnnnnow. Please, help me. EDIT:  Formatting  EDIT:  More has happened, last night my window air conditioner turned itself off and on over and over. Then, we woke up this morning to find that my hamster had disappeared. We have 2 hounds, and they would let us know if the hamster was inside the house. There is no way it got out of its cage, and there is no blood or bite marks by the cage. Finally, my job requires a box cutter, and we always put it out of the reach of the animals. We found it across the room behind my tv. Also, when I tried to resubmit this, Reddit had an "emergency maintenance". Just a coincidence?
Yep! It's a place for scary stories and experiences, but remember when commenting, you take everything you read as true no matter how outlandish it might be!
This might seem like a weird theory, but I always thought Dumbledore might have purposely lead them to it because he believed it would help Harry in the future. I always got the vibe that almost everything that happened to Harry at Hogwarts, Dumbledore had some hand in.
No, trying to make people made is riling people up. I wasn't trying to make anyone angry. Don't know why anyone would get mad over something posted on the Internet.
Sorry if I upset you! This was a girl in my class not me. I thought it was absurd and was curious as to what others thought!

Thank you! I don't really get a chance to talk to many peers at the college because I work full time and take classes. It mostly scares me because my apartment is located by all the frat houses, and one of the frats that was recently reinstated that was originally shut down for rape. Apparently, much hasn't changed, sadly.
Thank you! I'll keep all that in mind! I'll look through some of my favorite books and study up on the dialogue!
Every cat owner knows this...
He is so beautiful! I will post a picture when I get his Christmas presents! Baby socks! Also, sorry about the deleted reply! I didn't realize I was on my boyfriend's account!

My gosh! I can't imagine that. I've heard Alzheimer's is horribly hard to watch. Your stories just make me more worried about my parents getting it. I'm so sorry for you family. I'm not sure what else to say.
I don't know if you looked at The Noble Collection online. They have a lot of cool stuff!
