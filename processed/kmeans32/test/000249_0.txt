BANJOOOOOOOO!
Chicago. Home of corruption, police black sites and deep dish pizza.  Come for the pizza, stay because a corrupt cop took you to a black site and beat you.
DONT YOU FUCKING GENDER US YOU SHITLORD.

Jizz mopper.  Edit* are not have, oh well I'm leaving it.
I'd start with SMT 4, its a good place to start. It lays out the core mechanics in a way that is accessible and easy to understand.
Op's mom
This is the state of our country, the line between satire and real life has become one in the same. I am not even surprised anymore.  We have politicians who are bought by the highest bidder to shove an agenda that is bad for everyone but a few rich assholes. Democracy is dead, killed by backroom deals and corruption.   In the "Land of the Free" we have a government that has implemented some of the following in our name.   Rampant violations of the fourth amendment by the NSA.  Proxy wars orchestrated by the CIA (including drug smuggling and overthrowing governments).  Using the biggest tragedy in American history to start two failed wars, hundreds of thousands dead, billions of debt and a even more of a bad situation then when we went in.  But the biggest part of this that destroys me about this is using the horrific deaths of thousands of innocent Americans, to pass the Patriot" act, that takes away our rights.   Internal check points where citizens are told to prove citizenship (papers please). Not only that but these constitution-free zones are within 100 miles of our boarders, thats most of our population.   A militarized police force.   A failed, expensive and pointless war on drugs. That not only makes nonviolent people felons (no more vote), but turns people who have been doing what people have done for thousands of years into a crime.  There is so much more and these are only from my lifetime (28 years).    I love my country. I love the rights granted to me as an American. I am thankful for the blood that was shead for these rights.  But when I see that rich fucks run for leader of the free world I can't even be phased anymore.
Triggered.
Good on him.
All kinds, here is a list of some of them.   A single mom who lives in a house. Only drank wine.  A white chick covered in tats who carried a pistol and sold/used hard drugs.  An Asian girl who was a total hippy, loved taking doses and shrooms.   A mixed (black/white) collage girl who became my babys momma.  There is a buncha others.   But now that Ive been a single dad for four years all I really want now is a woman who is an amazing, caring, loving mother type. Who has ambition and motivation. But she has to have an edge, quick to call me a cunt face fuck nugget and knows how to fuck like a porn star.   Should be to hard to find right guys?
I honestly dont doubt that for a second.   With a echo-chamber that fragile every step needs to be taken to protect it.   What best is now its spun into I said Chu made the threat. Its all archived by them and me ([bonus message with mod](http://i.imgur.com/sCCH3Nl.png)), Those mothafuckas is cray.
The blood of your enemies.
I believe that most cops don't but most cops don't know that's what they are being prepared for.  You give a department military grade equipment and tell them that they are fighting a war on terror or drugs and the effect is obvious.
Yep.
I say fuck wasting anymore time with this guy.   Take him to the Super Dome and shoot him.   Complete with live news coverage. Sponsored by the Federal Government, Mountain Dew and Doritos. With a post-killing performance by Imagine Dragons and a 3-D Hologram of Michael Jackson.
Safe sex.  If you are going too drugs, do them responsibly (it can be done).  Save money.  Never stop asking questions.  Read.  Take care of your body.  Highschool means nothing in the long run.  Stay out of legal trouble.  You will make mistakes and you will fail at times.  Dont be an asshole.  Get to know the older people in your family and learn from them.  Be considerate.  Be humble.  Think of how you want your life to be and work for it.   Be active.  Be respectful to those who deserve it.  Follow your dreams.   You can reach your goals.   I'm living proof.   Beefcake.   BEEFCAKE!
Yoooooooooooooooo. Mr. Muscles I gotta know how do you feel about [this](http://imgur.com/h1MUWUA)  new Hitomi J-Cup picture that came out last week. It has to be the best one yet.   Also BRING BACK HIDING UNDER THE COATS.
Welp im done for the day. See you guys later.
Fucking idiots.
Chie is a fucking slut. Just imagine the amount of sausage she had between those lips. She was probably the town bike before you came around and she was instantly lusting after your salami next.  Her phonenumber is probably all over public toilets with the annotation that she's willing to do anything for a beefbowl.  And remember those 3 guys from her S rank? As soon as you enter the train to go back home those guys probably rape her and NTR the shit out of her, turning her into a sexslave so they don't have to pay for the meat to take turns on her
This just in. No shit.
Yeah I saw that one it's a good one but im also trying to max Charm/Courage/Academic also Elizabeth requests. Im looking for a guide that combines them. Thanks for posting.

Im gonna watch it with /v/. Like I always do. /v/ maybe a shit posting, console war, weeaboo playground, but when E3 rolls around its my favorite place to be. All the cringe, all the new memes and all the disappointment. The whole experience with them makes it all worth it.
This is nothing new. Cops always get little baby punishments. A civilian assaults someone gets jail time, probation and fines the whole nine yards. A cop does it he will get a payed vacation while an "investigation" is carried out. A once that "investigation" is done and finds "Officer acted in department guidelines" he is back on the street doing it all over agian.   [Remember the cops who did the illegal anal searches? They are still on the street](http://rt.com/usa/163428-nm-cops-jobs-anal-probes/)  [This former cop pleaded guilty to 5 felonies and he gets 6 months house arrest](http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/palm-beach/fl-delray-cop-guilty-plea-20140602,0,7398752.story)  I could go on and on, but we have /r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut for that.
