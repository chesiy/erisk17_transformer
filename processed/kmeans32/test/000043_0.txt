Omg you're adorable. Definitely the office cutie  And Happy Birthday!
"Oh. Madison... You're... I thought you were... Um..."
Haha, I thought so. However, your eyes are mesmerizing, and your smile is adorable. Whatever you're doing, keep it up. Also, coming from a former fellow emo-kid, even as you grow up, people of all kinds, tend to use that to generalize you. Don't be afraid to keep them on their toes. Let them make that assumption, but throw them a curveball every once in awhile. Leaves them thinking "wow, there's much more to this girl than 'hot emo chick'"

Well, that is what I just said. To my knowledge, yes. However, the person ingesting the drugs should be aware of what they are introducing into their body, and the effects it will have.

A rave in a bakery   Think about it, you dance all night, and then in the morning, freshly baked muffins.
Because, if the record is broken while its a pillow and blanket fort, then the record they're breaking isn't for largest pillow fort, but for largest pillow and blanket fort.

Trouble encoding 1080p files   Running [Windows 7](http://imgur.com/gDygYT2), using Adobe Media Encoder. Whenever I bring in an AfterEffects composition and render out a Quicktime file using the H.264 codec at 720p, it works fine. The problem is occurring when I try to render it out at 1080p. The render fails as soon as it starts, and the Error Log simply says "Error compiling movie. Unknown error." Why is this happening, and what can I do to fix it?
You are gorgeous. You have an infectious smile, and from what I can tell, your body looks amazing. If anything, you look even cuter post-preggo.
Yes, yes they do ;)

When discussing religion with someone, and being told I was going to hell for being an atheist, the person followed up with "I wish I didn't believe that."
I personally would never think negatively about it. Hell, if anything, it'd be a turn on for me. All these guys wanting a girl, and I'm the only one who has a chance with her.
God bless America!!!

lol, yeah..
I'm sure everyone here will be saying the same thing, but fuck those people! Like what you like, and don't be ashamed of it. If you lose friends because of the music you listen to, then they aren't the kind of friends you want to keep around. OR, they may respect you for being unashamed of it, and like you more. It may even open their eyes to the genre. "Well, they like EDM, and they're cool, so maybe EDMs not so bad." Or, and this isn't recommended, but if you wanna be more passive with it, just play it off as a joke. If they catch you listening to electronic music and laugh at you, just be in on the joke. They'll laugh, you'll laugh, and you all have a good time. The best way to deal with a bully is to laugh with them, as opposed to letting them laugh at you.
Whichever one proposes first.

Simply... perfection
Not sure who she is, but that picture has been around for a long time. She may be a nobody.
