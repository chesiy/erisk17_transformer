4000+ upvotes? I thought this was common knowledge. Freaking kids know nothing of practical stuff anymore.
Other than magazines and newspapers?
Be careful, bricked phones are a real thing, and the likelihood of it happening varies greatly from device to device. Do more than read forums where you find your phone. Create accounts and ask questions, pick brains, see what kind of issues others have come across. XDA is usually my first stop for Android questions.
I still have mine too, in the collectors edition box I bought at circuit city, along with the manual and dvds, but I lost the figure that was included. Statesman, it was. This was issue 3 I think, right before the big nerf. As soon as I heard about them talking about it on the radio I grabbed it on the way home after work. One of the greatest buys of my life.
SSLauncher is my favorite when I want to take the time to customize it. It's gridless, the widgets can be overlapped, and it can have a banner area at the top following different rules. It takes a bit to find all the options, it's not the most user friendly. But with SSLauncher, Zooper, UCCW, and Desktop Visualizer there is literally nothing I haven't been able to come up with on my home screen. Get or make custom icons and fonts, and the sky's the limit. However, all this has a high learning curve (not Tasker high, but nothing is Tasker high) and to make what I want can take hours.      I wish the home screens I posted on Google+ groups stuck after I deleted the pics from my account, some were fantastic. It's been a good while since I've been willing to put in the time to make a new one. One day I'll get into it again, just not today.
lol That was yours? To be fair, it was one of the first ones I listened to, stumbled on it just as I was getting into Secret World. If I remember right, I was in and out of it between SWC episodes, so I probably didn't jump in and binge listen like I usually do. It's on my short list of pods to listen to again. I do that when I can't remember many details. I'll be sure to shoot you an update of a better informed opinion. It had a fight on a bridge and later on in their HQ, right? And something about betrayal within the ranks?
Now that makes perfect sense. Excellent advice, thank you.
So is this just a grind until you're killed?   I'm still learning the game. So far I've gotten geared up a couple of times, went looking for others to maybe get in on a team or something, and headed for Electro. So far, when I've come across others, I've tried to get the drop on them and give them a chance to be friendly. Nope. I've made 1 kill so far on a guy who came at me after I told him to be cool and I wouldn't kill him. The rest of my encounters with others have yielded zero chances to make any friends at all. I did meet a guy once who spared me on spawn once, but he was streaming Twitch so I think he probably had to. The rest of everyone I've met has either lied and said they have a group of friends we can go meet (which means follow me so we can kill you somewhere safe to loot you) or killed me outright.   I understand this is a game with no rules, but jesus fucking christ, put SOME kind of incentive for people not to be asshats. It's like they made a game where everyone is supposed to be evil. Am I missing something? Are public servers just the wrong places to be? Or is this a game just for cowardly assholes who enjoy lying and killing anyone weaker? Is there a place off-game to find friends? Because in-game sure isn't working out for me.
Fun facts about dinosaurs.
Pretty obvious you haven't got much experience with the real drug world. Innocents suffer every day due to the whole mess. Not everyone gets a choice whether or not they associate with them, and often times are completely unaware they are. My sister's best friend in school was killed because her father was in it. She had no idea about anything.   And war, as horrible as I believe it to be, is the natural state of affairs. Has there ever been a time in history when it wasn't? Are they all necessary? No. The Iraq war wasn't, I think. But when groups like ISIS or the Nazis rise up, evil will only triumph when good men do nothing. Did more people die in WWII than would have died had Hitler had gone unchecked?   But all that stuff aside, I still would prefer a children's toy store didn't sell drug dealer toys.
Oh dear lord, don't tell me those dumbass legwarmers are a thing now.  edit: So I just asked my white trash baby's momma about these, she's seen them. Kids, en mass, have no taste.
Pavarotti found alive and well.

Yeah, I just saw another article saying the Android app comes out next week.

I actually thought about doing something like that, but my tastes definitely go against the grain.  I can tell you GO Launcher is pretty much the king of GB, but quite a few folks love ADWLauncher EX, Launcher Pro, and Zeam, and Nova and Apex launchers rule ICS. The bulk of the rest of them are pretty much the same, with different options within each that tailor to different peoples needs. In launchers, I put a little list at the top of launchers that are really different from the rest.  With browsers, there are a lot of good ones. Opera is probably the favorite, with lots of Dolphin users. Chrome is really popular on ICS.  As far as app stores go, Play Market is the only one, outside of providers' own apps, that won't break your TOS. Amazon has a lot of followers, mostly due to the free app of the day. GetJar was getting really popular until they dropped their free Gold apps. SlideME and soc.io mall have a few followers, too.
