Honestly, similar to my [Glass Skull](http://i.imgur.com/nrWSQvi.jpg) project, I hadn't put much thought into the plants themselves. These are my first two terrariums and I'm just seeing how the containers handle themselves (how much water to use, what soil/rock combination to use). I'm almost ashamed to say that these are carnation seeds, but I'll probably change it to something more suitable  once these guys run their course. Its a simple set up with larger stones blocking the gumball shoot, bonsai pebbles at the base and plain potting mix for the seeds. It's all trial and error.
That ventolin inhale.
My mate got done for speeding, on the same day he had a prang.
Perfect execution.
Haha. Like saying "a redditor who needs no introduction, here's Slip_85!". I get it. But I have endless trouble uploading imgur galleries, and by putting the name of the van in the title I thought that should've been enough. Maybe I should have put 'link for the lazy'.
When you have badboys like [these](http://i.imgur.com/EE9vic0.jpg) lying around, you can get caught up in it. Check out the fake debris.

No. Well, at least I don't think I did.
Yarp.
TIL that three Earth hours equal 2 Mars days.
So. Good.
Tremors!
Pigtails.
Do you mean [this](http://youtu.be/_mIZrhrezSo?t=5m35s) quote?
Thanks for the information! Considering the different coloured ink, it makes a lot more sense that is a list that was compiled over time.

Well played sir, well played.

All I know is what it's race footage from the Isle of Man TT. Not sure about year or how he ended up.
My favourite Aussie act this year was Seth Sentry. Dear Science will get up there, but [Float Away](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-4virowSKM) definitely got a lot of us on board.

Happy Birthday for Monday.

I think it was the landmine that went off too late.
Are motherfuckers.
How fast can you swim? Didn't a 16 year old girl swim faster than Lochte?  But then again, it's not about you, or whether you can dunk.  It's about something special that will inspire millions of people from here on in.
Heh, thanks. Whether this subreddit takes off or not, I just think it's more relevant now that nin has effectively disbanded and that Trent is having just as much success outside of the nineinchnails box.
What's the DVD called? I just thought it was part of the viral campaign Trent did for Year Zero. About a minute in I was thinking the sound is really good for somebody filming in the crowd. I nearly didn't watch all of it because I saw that there wasn't enough time in the video for The Wretched to follow The Frail. Glad I did.
more confused than unhappy, and I tried to clarify this with the magician analogy. even though the slo mo is showing me exactly what is happening, I still have no idea how to do what I just saw. I definitely should have put "this confuses the shit out of me but I'm okay with it" as the title. so I don't do anybody's head in.
