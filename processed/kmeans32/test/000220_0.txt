I like the color theme. I find it really similar to my diarrhea, which makes it personally touching. You have piece of me on your desktop.
They slow at making riots too? You need to learn effiency.
Current measures are your own fault. You had better options earlier. Instead you wanted to act like squaky kid. Are you aware your tax poliicies are like kids play compared to ours? Are aware we dont have holidays like you have? Are aware our pension system is nothing like yours? We dont have those advantages as people. We work hard, we pay lot and we dont complain. We pay our debts. We dont cry and demand other countries to come and save us. And we are also in deep depression, we lost jobs and do financial cuts ourself without nobody DEMANDING us. Last week there was huge mass layoff in microsoft. We lost 2000 jobs with single hit. We have pretty much lost over 10k+ job only in Nokia. Yes we dont have our crown gem Nokia anymore. But you see us crying? We are stand and we do our best. Begging is not pride for us, it is shame. Pride is when you stand behind your words and go forward without complains. And we have word for it, it is called SISU.
Tits.
So lying and misleading is okey as long as it promotes your own intrests? I think this is the fundemenal problem you have. And also the reason you guys should not be trusted.
I love the idea, but I am not really fun of execution. Like who is the actual user of this? It is sold as "plug it in" so i quess target audience is regular people? But who is going to update and maintain the box then? But if the target group is more advanced users why is this different than any other little box? I think this will bring just harm, because if this ends up in regular people homes and they dont understand how to maintain or update it, we will just end up with people condifental data leaking around.
Tm riippuu vhn rokotteesta. En ne mitn jrke olla ottamatta pitkn kytettyj ja tutkittuja rokotteita. Mutta sitten tuleekin joku uus "flunssa" johon ei olekkaan valmista rokotetta ja joka tehdn rokote mahdollisimman nopeasti ja jolla kaikki sitten pakkorokotetaan. Sitten tuleekin kaunista jlke. Yksi argumenteista oli mys se ett PAKKOROKOTUS ei ole yksi ja ainoa tapa ratkaista ongelmaa, on mys olemassa keppi ja porkkana.
Joo
That is not obsidian?

Aika moni ainakin omassa opiskelijapiiriss syyn niit opintokuukausia juuri sen opintotuen takia, eli 5,5op tukikuukautta kohden. Se ett tuki tulisi joka tapauksessa ei ainakaan nopeuttaisi sit.
I am bit scared the point in this was: "You were ally with Germans so you were nazi yourself" :D
Pussy, any single ladies here?
Monkey never cramps!
I would be happy in that spot too.
No they didint use it to intimidate. It was just because it was hard to disposal those corpses in that temperature and specially enemy corpses wasnt priority.
It is because temperature. When you get shot your blood circulation stops and your body turns to big ice block. Post picture is probably from winter war where temperature was 43 C ( 45 F ).
Well I know Simo Hyh... I am finnish after all. But if you compare the balls you need to take alone 10tanks with birch logs versus shooting people from the distance I think it is over hype. Simo wasnt even awarded with war award (mannerheimin ristinritari) even it was proposed. The award is given to those who show enormous courage in battle. There was multiple fins with no single media attentation who fough with ten times bigger balls than hyh. Specially those in command/guerilla troops (kaukopartio) who fought behind enemy lines. They splitted russians troops on road with machine gun and when russians were in small groups they took them one by one. Kaukopartio troops were also the reason fins had more guns/ammunations/tanks in the end of war than in the begin.
Maybe you havent understood this joke then? It it joke about russians being "puppet" aka dolls. Jokes can be disrespectful too, how many n**** you know? And btw I am not even Russian myself. It is not about "dolls", it is political joke.
I think this post is hateful and disrespectful, but it also shows you dont know russians. You think socialism grew out of hate towards others? No, It grew out of idea people being equal. Yeah, It didint work out in real life, but at least they tried.  I think capitalism isnt good either, but it is the best we got now. It makes people work and world going on. We just need to hold in it as long as we get something better. Maybe it is socialism where robots are working for us, but let capitalism be our vehicle in that bright future.
Arch? if you want to be cool install gentoo. Even those Arch dudes dont have balls to install it.
I wonder where the fuck you work when it is allowed to watch butt pics.
I try to make favour and get this pic NSFW tagged, because if i see this pervert way, I am sure there is boss who sees it same way. And instead "thank you", I am called fucking pedophile, please go and hang yourself.
Well you can look muricans and see where their foods are taking them. It is not only fat and salt but also all those chemicals and gene manipulated shit they put in their bodies. All those chemicals are not even properly tested. GL, I am still going to eat naturally. ;3
It is pretty, I like it.
nvm, that sounds creepy if you think it wrong way..
seriously?
