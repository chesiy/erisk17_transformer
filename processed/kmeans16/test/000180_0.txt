[The more you know! Thanks!](http://www.adultswim.com/music/venturebrosalbum/)  But my main point is not lost, when I listen to this piece, I can't help but see 21 and 24 in my mind.
I really like how you finished that and 100% agree. Inexperienced dog owners should not get these breeds, spitz-like or wolf like, in almost any climate, especially warmer. They have high maintenance grooming requirements and need frequent exercising. They are prone to animal and small children aggressive behavior if not properly trained.  Stick with Golden Retrievers and German Shepherds, JUST DON'T SHAVE THEM!!!
No, you think all those things. I didn't say them. I just don't get up in arms when someone claims I am acting this way, or like such thing, stereotypical. I embrace it, and I continue to live my life within the context that I am not special, and I am not unique. I am simply a product of the culture I surround myself with.  You have low self esteem, and I'm sorry. Have a good night.
That's another thing, you don't eat it. You put it in your mouth, alive, then let it shoot it's spray. Wild, I know, but so delicious.

I think you can add animals you see, like if you find a peer reviewed study, or just happen to take a picture or what not.  Someone put 'american manatee' under my coordinates, which is obviously false, as I live near the Pacific ocean. Maybe a Dugong, but no way a manatee. So obviously someone added an animal.
Yeah, hence the deletion. I'll be civil.   So before it was more mainstream to be gay, lesbian, whatever, individuals that didn't fit within gender archetypes didn't have the luxury of being in the closet. Men with higher pitched voices, intersex individuals, women that had no interest in feminine things. These people were the first to be out, and were usually ostracized for such. They probably didn't want to 'look' or 'act' queer, because it could mean death, imprisonment, your life getting turned upside down. People within a percentage of our population don't fit gender archetypes, it's most likely a mix of genetics and upbringing. Some parents know their child will end up gay. Some are thrown for a loop.  The world is a funny thing, but it takes all the colors to make a rainbow.  And i was being a dick. So here's my take. My apologies.

My one year free of weed   It's been a crazy ride for sure. I just want to share some of my story and experiences. Maybe some one else went through some of the same things as I did. Maybe you're going through it now.  I started smoking weed at 16, I was a musician so it felt natural. I preferred cigarettes and alcohol, so I never got too sucked in. I crushed on most of the guys I smoked with, they made me feel a false sense of validation. I stopped briefly, and by the time I got to college, I fell in love with mary jane again. Or at least the people passing me the blunt.  One day a friend told me, "Hey man, you know you need to buy a sack at some point, right?" It hit me like a light from heaven; holy shit, I can buy weed. So I did. Again, and again, and again. I couldn't afford college after another year, being out of state, and too depressed to work, so I left. Shit got worse.  I smoked all day, every day. Medical grade, all the time. I went in and out of programs and rehabs, mostly because I liked the alcohol, weed, pill combos. Years went by. I was moving at a snail's pace.  I ended up moving on a whim to another state, and ended up in a shitty relationship in a shitty apartment. Fuck, the weed there wasn't even that great. But I put my game face on, and bought frequently from H dealers. Never any hard stuff. Just weed.  I had an epiphany after I had some money stolen. I invited a bunch of friends over (fitting). We smoked. We drank. We popped pills. And I cried. I cried because I lost not only my money, but because I lost myself. I called 911 on myself, went to a hospital, and left after 3 days.  23, in the middle of a new state, and trying to stay sober, was insane. I couldn't sleep most nights. I stopped drinking caffeine. I was desperate for friends. My boyfriend and I fought constantly. But I kept my goal in mind, just fucking stay sober.  I had the insight to leave the state, and plan my next move. I found a town I liked, with a career program I liked, and moved on in. Still fresh in my absence from weed, I was still overly talkative and couldn't find enough ways to spend my time. Unemployed. Lonely. A mess.  I made friends were I could, kept looking for a job, and prayed. I prayed all the time. Sometimes with other people, mostly by myself. Some people find it weird for an LGBT man to be spiritual, but fuck, that's all I had going. My family slowly starting respecting me again. I got phone calls from people that cared. I was moving forward, and people took notice.  Finally, after all the job searching, I got a job I loved. Soon, a new car. Soon after that, I broke up with my long distance boyfriend, and I was dating normal people again. Things still affect me, but I have the emotional willpower to handle them like an adult. Life isn't so much a roller coaster, more so a stroll over the sand dunes at a beach. Every moment more beautiful than the last, even if I can't see the ocean from my point of view.  I can't really dish out advice. I don't feel like that's my place. I can just share what I've gone through, and it was hell. I wouldn't wish that upon my worst enemy, even if that happens to be me.  Life today is beautiful. And i'm glad to be hear to share it with you.
I'm in the, "I don't see why this is a problem" camp.  I groom dogs, and plenty of people bring their dogs in to the salon like this. I wish more would. Dematting a dog is akin to torture, and long haired dogs like Cavilers can easily get dirt, grass, seeds (sometimes growing), twigs, poop, fishing hooks, gum, ect. stuck in their coats. Then we have to shave your dog and get yelled at after.
This made me sad to think about. Well... I got STD tested before I dated my first boyfriend at a christian testing center. We started dating, and then the results came back. It said I was HIV-1 positive. While I freaked out and got tested over and over again (even the state health department got involved), my boyfriend stayed by my side, well aware he might test positive as well. Every test came back negative, and I, understandably, lost my shit over the next 6 weeks. Finally, they were able to tell me I was negative. The whole thing of me losing my shit mentally, and this whole 'we both have HIV' thing threw a wrench in our relationship, so he broke up with me. Which I get. Completely. It was both of our first relationship and it was just totally fucked up by me. We've both moved on and done better and bigger things.
There's only [one](http://global3.memecdn.com/pokemon-in-real-life_o_608017.jpg) legitimate answer.
1) Wut?  2) Hey,man, that's just like, your opinion.  3) Procreation and advanced societies don't necessarily correlate. "First World Countries" tend to have fewer babies, not more. More birth control, abortion, planned pregnancy. Essentially, people fucking in the butt.  4) First Nation Americans, Tahitians, Mesoamericans, Indians, I'm sure I'm missing a few others, but shoot, send me a message and i'll send you towards a whole bunch of historical websites on gay and transgendered relationships and social structures throughout history! Yay learning!  5) Try using the word gay. 'Homosexual' comes off as offensive. Makes me feel like I'm a monkey in a cage. But what do I know. I'm just a gay man in a straight man's world.

So... I just read through **WAY** too many comments and post. As a result, I'm going to leave this here, in hopes that other's can benefit from the eye bleach that is this classic [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0-Sv6YnxEc).
