The dead body in my car.
I threw my keyboard out the window and smashed it.
I was already in the closet when I was writing this. It is literally one of the first results I got that looked somewhat like the car.
I live in a fairly small town so we don't have a lot of Police Officers around. Although I just called my dad and told him about this, He just came home. He found the car, but he didn't find the guy.
That is the same as me. I play quite a lot of DayZ on medium pop servers (Australian). The one I saw (Actually I did not see them, because they were in the Camo building wall glitch) my friends ran in to try and secure it, because we had a farming hoe. Then suddenly one of them loses their gear, then they get carpet bombed. Luckily I was on the hill outside. This happened at Veresnik.
There would not be a linear story. You could side with Bandits and Heroes, maybe they would both have the same objective, but they would get there different ways. If eventually the devs let us learn their new scripting language and let us build custom mods for SA, I will learn and make this. You wouldn't even need to do the quests, you could just kill everyone and rule the land.
I didn't say that they would completely remove Multi-player. It would be an additional mode, where you get a single player character. This character wouldn't be available for use in Multi-player servers.
Well they're trying to make loot spawns realistic, and pretty much the only past-time in prison, was to read.
I thought it was a Train or a Submarine.
Not really relevant. Post this to the Dxtory subreddit.
"Maximum Security"
I am really confused about that comment too. Care to explain soggywaffles? Also yeah RecentIdiocy he is talking about Far Cry 4 at the beginning of the game you wait 10-15 minutes and the main antagonist comes back and finishes the game.
TV = "Television"
Russains.  *Friendly Russains*
Kind of makes farming seem pointless.
Did you know that Day Z isn't the only game that has hackers within it? Did you know that nearly every single game can be hacked using C++? Did you know whining on the subreddit won't get hackers stopped anytime soon? How about you write some code that can stop hackers, send it to the developers and leave a little "Your Welcome" note with it. GG no re.
