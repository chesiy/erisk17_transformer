Funniest glitch you've experienced?   I was at the bottom of lake meade when Victor rolled up to say Howdy. We had a nice conversation, at the bottom of the lake. No rebreather equipped either
We have those everywhere around here. They are pretty and stay out if the way. I like to think they're a feature of the garden
Oi me where's the fookn comish yea? Give us a peek
Yea it just seems like they said it to be stupid. Sometimes people just want to be offended in this sub. Weird....
No way! I was wrong. He is the guy from Mindy project though right?
I mean she knows what she looks like, and gets paid for it. I don't feel bad.
I like it, I just don't see how this is a noisy gif
Or maybe I don't like the panel idea. Why do they feel the need to give a voice to anti vaxxers and the like. You don't always need both sides. Hes too middle of the road for me. I do like keep it 1hunna though
When is new York pizza and pasta supposed to open?   It's going where smiling moose used to be. Does anyone know anything about it?  I really want.another.place to get pizza by the slice, and hopefully late
It's a bunch of shorts he's edited together, if I'm not mistaken.

I really enjoyed the nemesis system but never prgressed very far in the story. I managed to get evrything you can that doesnt unlock in story mode. there was just no push to play the story in that game
Why is egalitarianism not promoted by SJW?   And communism as well. I understand there aren't a lot of communists, but in my view almost all the worlds problems are socioeconomic. If we lived in an equal society we wouldn't need mens rights or feminism. I used to think that was the goal of both groups, but now I think they want to be better than each other. Both want their gender to dominate. It just seems odd and at ends with the origins of both movements.
Skipped exams today to do nothing.   I'm in my fourth year of college. I haven't had a good semester yet. I just have no desire to go to school. I'm a biology major and have no idea what I would do with it when and if I graduate. All I really want to do is take some time off and discover myself, but that sounds so cliched and pathetic. I haven't seen my therapist in about a month but I've been keeping up with my meds. There isn't really a question I just wondered if anyone else has been down this path before.
