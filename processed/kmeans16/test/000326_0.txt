Plane crash
I guess it was when I was 19, I dropped out of school and decided the thing for me to do was to move, far away, Australia. I was going through a lot of emotional issues at the time and I hoped that moving to another place would help me 'discover' myself in some way. I flew out there on a shoestring budget so I had loads of connections, it was a long trip! I eventually made it to my hostel in Sydney, I remember being completely shellshocked as I lay on my bed, I wasn't the best at speaking to people back then so it took me days before I met anyone, that's the loneliest moment if my life so far.

Great, advice thanks! The SIPPS combined with ISA sounds about what I'm looking for, unfortunately I'm currently in central London so it will be a long time until the house deposit is sorted!
