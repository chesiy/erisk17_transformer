I was tempted to make a respectable version of the Bologna Cake but my hubby talked me out of it.  I still think I could make one that Lola wants!
Don't know about Bob but I love Burlesque so I'll name it, the Mae West.  "You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough!"  "I generally avoid temptation unless I can't resist it."   What do you think lol!
Ya know!
This has to be in Texas!
It's no big secret how to make your own.  Take cubed steak and pound the shit out of it till it looks like it wrestled with a waffle iron and lost.    Season 2 cups of flour with the seasoning of your choice.  I like "Slap Yo Momma".  In a second container mix 1 1/2 cups buttermilk, 2 Tsp baking powder, 1 Tsp baking soda and 1 egg, garlic and hot sauce.  Coat in flour,  then dredge in the buttermilk mixture and place back into the flour.    Very Important...when you coat it the second time make sure you thoroughly pat the flour into the steak until it feels dry.  Place your steaks on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper and dusted with flour.  Refrigerate up to an hour until you're ready to fry em up.  This step is not necessary but I feel it makes a crispier crust and gives you time to clean.  Fry at 325F in 1/2 inch oil about for 6 to 8 minutes on each side.  Use 2 Tbsp of the leftover oil and pan drippings to make a cream gravy.    You've done it all right if you don't need a knife to cut it or teeth to chew it for that matter!
Your Dracaena Marginata is not happy! Marginata's need water but not a lot and do not let them dry out.   Good news!  It's perfectly normal for a DM to loose its lower leaves as it grows.  If it's a matter of too little watering you will see brown dead leaves scattered all over.  The brown tips you see are usually caused by salt damage.  This can happen a number of ways but it can be prevented by watering the DM enough so that water drains out  the bottom and flushes the salts out.  If you let this plant sit in its own water runoff especially its own "waste" then it will uptake the salt and will burn the ends.  Letting it sit in water for any length of time will also lead to stem and fungal rot.   Make sure all the soil is saturated when water when you do water.  Sometimes a rootball will dry up to the point that water doesn't penetrate and just leaks around it so use your best judgement.  Marginatas need water and don't like to ever dry out but they also cannot stand to be left in standing water.   So it looks like this guy need to be repotted because I'm seeing some roots and the pot is too small for the plant.  Choose a pot that is no more than 2 inches bigger than the original and had drainage.  Don't fertilize.  After transplanting use a weak solution of root starter.  Again, don't freak out if it loses for leaves.  At this point you want to grow roots, not leaves.  BTW,  just cut off the ends of the leaves at an angle.  Good luck!
Their in-house made pickles are also wonderful.  My favorite is the chorizo-infuzed  Caca Oaxaca burger.  Chef Grober really rose to the occasion when he took on the challenge of creating the best burger in Fort Worth 2013 within shouting distance of Fred's, a Fort Worth all-star whole-in-the-wall burger joint since 1978!  Good things to come!
I originally posted the pics at r/military.  I posted this to r/neckbeards at their urging.  Most of the comments I've read were positive.  The few that were negative mostly took pock-shots at my calling my son out.  Sorry but believe it or not, every parent of a NB or almost a NB should shame their NB.  Being a NB is not something to aspire to!    Having to ask my adult son to make sure his door to his room was closed when I had company come over didn't make me love him less and he always knew that I was trying to impart a sense of cleanliness when I made him clean his room once every 3 months.    For all off the NB's out there, you should feel good that he won't suffer your fate LOL!    I just know that the military will instill that into him and all the negative NB's can kiss my ass!
Cheese on french fries is pretty common across the States.  There are variations such as Irish Nachos, cheese over thick-cut potato chips or Frito Pie, cheese and chili over Frito corn chips.  Doing the same with gravy, not a variation.   You couldn't cover tortilla chips in gravy and get away with calling it Nachos.    Poutine; however, is a different dish altogether and a mighty tasty one at that!    With that said,  what's with the burnt onions?  Yuck!
Did this all the time as a night baker in the Navy!  When I worked in a Flag Mess sometimes I'd have to go the Navy Exchange as soon as it opened to buy beer for beer cheese soup.  The looks I got! LOL
I am trying to imagine the Jesus of Nazareth telling a starving person that feeding them wouldn't help others in the long run.    Then again, according to Catholic doctrine, life on this earth is inconsequential and the only import is life after death(oxymoron) and the best way to get a good death/life is to suffer as Jesus did.   So the masses are told to suffer while the priests live this life high on the hog.  Explain again why we, the masses, are skeptical of the motivations of a religious organization that has its own bank, government and voice at the UN that no other religion has?
Infuriating isn't it.  I do have one correction for Paxalot.  Although female is the default mode until genes and hormones come into play, the zygote and subsequent fetus aren't really female or male but have the potential for both.  If you must rely on genes themselves it's telling that males are one chromosome off from females and not the other way around. Few die-hard misogynists will even acknowledge the science of embryology like some congress"men" from my state!    The point though is even with our scientific understanding why do some people subscribe to an ancient mythology that reduces the importance of females and consequently subjugates them to males?
I'm not ashamed but I do regret my part in the decision. His father had a say in the matter too.  However, your anger at me is misdirected.  Our society puts a lot of pressure to conform and while my decision was partially based on this I do not think he is deformed or had his sexuality affected in any way.    With that being said, I'm sure your own mother and father would like to circumcise whatever organ that causes the vitriolic bile that spews from your mouth and replace it with a civilized prosthetic.
What a beautiful calli! We have one that's a stray. She drinks from our Koi pond and catches the mice so we feed her dry food. She got flack from our two cats but doesn't anymore.  Try this; make sure Sasha is there before you feed her. Give Sasha a Tablespoon of what you're feeding the stray (even if it's the same thing you feed your cat everyday, Sasha will go for it for territorial reasons).  It's a distraction and it reinforces a positive element to the visits from the stray.  Worked for us, they now touch noses through the glass door to our sunroom.  As far as the hole......bad idea!  You're inviting squirrels, coons, skunks and possums to make their home there.   Good luck and best wishes!
No, this is soo right!
We have that in the USA too. Taste like a mustard chip. Not bad if you like mustard.
