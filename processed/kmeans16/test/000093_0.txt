Yes it is.
Don't you have anything better to do but bitch and complain? Fuck exists, it's a word, get over it you boring old goat.
First off...nobody on "here" is a "people" just exaggerated versions of what they think they are. Secondly, the internets is not going to help you be a better person, talking to a live human being who you feel is better and wiser than yourself will.

Maybe I'm just a crusty old jaded RT, you know, the guy at the head of the bed keeping his cool during code blues ;)

It's a travesty nonetheless. Comparing the two and saying one "ain't so bad" is evidence of injustice and of a society run by propoganda machines. You are getting sucked into it, pal, and are becoming part of the problem. Both ways are wrong. It is wrong to even have forum for knee-jerking verdicts until this case is decided in court but America fucked that up a long, long time ago and now we breed people who have no idea what justice really is outside of what Hollywood rams down their throats.
You can tell she was already ruining her feet even at this young age with high heels and small shoes. That big toe angle... dead giveaway and kind of a turn off.
Its a portkey
Yay for you. Fat people have that smell that comes from in between the folds that they cannot reach and I would say that is pretty disgusting.
Boob ruiners and booger-covered face jewelry. I'll pass.
To you ME3 haters. [spoilers]   Were you even playing the game? I've almost finished, making mostly a renegade campaign, and I am deeply affected by the choices I've made. I lied to the Wrex about the Genophage, wiped out the entire Quarian fleet and watched the wreckage burn like fireworks in the sky of their homeworld, mercy-killed an Ardat-Yakshi, watched Tali kill herself....all because of choices I have made (or didn't make). I would say in comparison to ME1 and 2, the choices are much deeper in ME3, more emotionally connected. I really like playing the renegade campaign, and found it pretty easy to play along in ME1 and 2, but in 3, I really can feel the emotional impact of my choices. I can't be the only one who finds this a masterpiece of space opera.   [EDIT] I'm going to get drunk and finish the game tonight so I'll post later and tell you guys my final assessment..but so far its been pretty fun. So far I've gotten my moneys worth.
