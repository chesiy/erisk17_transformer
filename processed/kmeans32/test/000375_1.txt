I painted a Sockey Salmon and some curious claws
For me, it's all of the different sounds. For example, the droid that answers the door to Jaba's Palace, it just sounds cool! I love that different droids sorta have their own indistinguishable languages. It makes some of them sound gritty and depth to their worlds. Another sound I enjoy is when a big ship, like a cruiser, is heavily under attack, or very badly damaged, they make that sorta "arooga" sound(I hope that makes sense. That's what I hear, at least). Lastly. hearing the range of emotion in R2's beeps.  I love it!
What little things about the Star Wars Universe do you love?
I love the movie "Her". I think Scarlett was perfect for that role. Her voice is just so captivating to me.
I digitally painted Furiosa from Mad Max: Fury Road!
Thank you! I appreciate it!
Hey, I should paint Dale! I felt a special connection to him... because his name was Dale :P And thank you very much!

I was going off of a photo for reference. Like I said, this was a study. That's what he looked like in my photo reference. But I appreciate the advice, though.
I digitally painted Glenn, as a study!
I'm rewatching TWD(just finished S4E02). Decided to take this chance to read the old discussion thread and came across an interesting comment.
Thank you for this. I've been trying to motivate myself to get into shape, but I'm not sure what I should do first. Like, what do I eat? Will I even have time to prepare meals, everyday? If I go to the gym ,how do I know, no one's going to take photos of me and post them on some place like reddit, to mock me? I see that happening a lot. It really terrifies me :/  It causes me so much anxiety.
And I appreciate your honesty :)
Yeah :( But thank you!!! :D
I painted Clone Commander Cody! Happy Star Wars Day!!
Oh my goodness. I'm so, so sorry you had to go through that. Thank you for the heads up. I hope you're living in a much better place, now! Take care!
Aww man, that sucks :/ It's one of the few cheap places I could find.
Oh wow, good thing I found out the apartments aren't located there. Thank you!
Also, is that area LGBT friendly?
I digitally painted Darth Maul!
Thank you! I honestly never done any other shows, but I certainly can! I was really inspired to paint something from this show because I absolutely love the style of the show; the colors and cinematography! It' a really gorgeous show!
From looking at pictures of Robin for reference, I guess I just sorta picked up that little attribute!
That wasn't my intention, but I guess it is interesting how that played out, haha!
Thank you, so much!
I don't plan on selling this particular piece, only because I want to avoid legal trouble, but I do have other pieces of art for sale here:http://society6.com/cassy_dale  Thank you so much for your interest!
I painted Claire and Frank in a scene from Season One!
I'm very, very glad you made it out safe and sound :D
Did religions other than Christianity inspire art forms like the Catholic Church did with baroque art, pre 19th century?
I always feel a bit weird telling people about how bears are my favorite animals. Shortly after, I have to explain to them that it's in no way a sexual reason. Yeah... Grizzly Bears are my favorite. I even like the bad, too, haha!
I think he was just being thourough and tying up loose ends. All for the sake of being loyal to Frank, maybe? I'm not sure. But yeah, I felt like he didn't need to kill her. But it happened :/
I do. I was commenting on the fact that most people seem to not like how their characters were being handled, this season, as opposed to the last two. To me, they seemed to come out on top a lot, the last two seasons. My apologies, I should have been more clear.
Oh my gosh. I did not know that was a thing. Thank you!!
