He **did** grow up as kind of a spoiled rich kid, so when the time came that he actually had to commit to/work hard on something, he probably couldn't handle it. It makes sense, and he did voice his disdain for the fact that it was a JOB (which is actually a very positive thing, despite his attitude toward it) several times on the show and in the Ode to Jon video
look, dude, I understand it's just a joke, but I can't suspend my disbelief entirely!  **At his job?** Seriously? Jokes have to have SOME sort of basis in reality here
The Second Endless Ocean is my personal favorite. They're both at the top of their comedic game in that one. That's the first episode of GG I've rewatched (haven't finished it yet though. Been meaning to start it where I left off)
If you watch Grumps for the gameplay, then something is seriously wrong with you.  However, it isn't entertaining if someone keeps making the same fuck-up over and over and over and over again and blames the game for it. Not because I'm watching the gameplay and I want to see progression, but because the conversation becomes stagnant, and it's just annoying to hear Arin ~~bitch about~~ er- "analyze" video-games.  Personally, I can't even stand when they talk about games at all, because for the most part, they aren't funny about it. But there were a few episodes recently where the fuck-ups actually were hilarious. Maybe they just need to learn to edit some moments out like that. If there are a bunch of fuck-ups that are funny, leave em in. If not, then just cut out that footage, and use the star selection screen as a point of transition, that way nobody knows anything was edited out  Just treat the show like a podcast that uses video-games to inspire discussion and it's entertaining. Otherwise, not so much. Arin and Danny are both super funny guys and I don't watch GG to see them beat games. It'd be better if they stopped playing them every time they weren't having fun
You have money right? Yeah, you can afford liposuction
I usually don't care, but there's only so many jokes Danny can make at the expense of Arin's failure before it gets boring. A whole episode of fuck-ups is fine, but not if it's the exact same fuck-up over and over again. Go to a different level and fuck-up there.  Plus, it's just super fucking annoying to hear Arin complain about a video-game. Ever.
**I'll start it off:**  "I'm having a waking nightmare,  I'm seeing colors in the sky...  Everybody wants to know about me,  but they don't know about my........  big ol' penis, flopping around,  it's three big feet of pleasure.  Put it in your mouth and put it in your vagine...  Everyone's having a real good time,  when they're hanging around my big floppy penis.  Can't quite stroke it really fast.  Covering three feet of skin with your hand isn't really easy.  Here's how fast I can jack my whole dick,  "Hah, ah, ah, ah, aaahhh."  That includes the back and forth motion,  let's do it again, "Ah aahhh."  "Ah ah ah ah ah ah aaahhhh..."  That's how fast I can jack my peen.  Everybody thinks that they have seen my penis,  but they haven't,  'cuz if they have...  they'd shit themselves.
Death is coming for us all, man, woman, and child...   The Fyllid traveled 10 million light years to reach our world, to harvest the blood of the creatures they planted here long ago, in the age before recorded history. Those creatures began as simple-minded apes, but have now evolved into a society.  They'll be expecting no resistance. Let's be sure to give them one hell of a fight!  (As told by the crazy guy on the street corner with tin foil on his head)
No they cannot! That is the goddamn point! You can't sing small portions OR large portions! I'm not spamming, people like you just keep refusing to do any research! Fair use is clearly defined by law and that is not someone's opinion!  If you need different links, I can provide you with some, none of which you can't find yourself on google, but I assure you that they will all say the same thing. Here's one that debunks that weird '30 second rule' that people throw around. (one you probably believe, which is why you seem so adamant on your factually disproven position)  http://studentpressblogs.org/nspa/the-non-existent-30-second-rule/
lol, no. It's not Maker's rules, Maker doesn't own Grumps. It's a simple business decision, don't do anything that might get your video flagged for copyright infringement.  And no, it isn't covered under fair use. You cannot sing or play a song that you do not have the rights to in a video that you are monetizing. Plain and simple.  Arin is smart enough to know that it's best not to risk getting his channel taken down over something as dumb as singing some song.   Though, as long as they parody the song, changing the words/making fun of it, then they have free reign.   EDIT: Lol, why the hell was this downvoted? Because people "disagree?" I'm sorry folks, but that's the sad truth. That doesn't mean you downvote something. Do a small amount of research on copyright infringement, fair use, and the way MCN's function.
Sure thing :)
The Aqueduct?
My Runescape has girlfriends that are 6 years old
well after all the rape, of course! It's not pooping if it just falls out of you without your consent  (hint; because your asshole is widened)
This one time my brother's digestive system wasn't working right and he shat out undigested spaghetti and sauce. I know this sounds fake but it's completely real. We were camping, he took a dump in the woods, then called us over to show it to us (it had little bits of digested fecal matter, but mostly looked like a dropped plate of pasta) My dad took him to the doctor the next day, I don't remember anything past that and it never happened again.
Telling my daughter about "Heaven"   My daughter is two years old and I've been thinking a lot about when the time comes when somebody in our family tries to push religion on her. It'll definitely happen and it'll likely start with something they'll see as "small and harmless" like the concept of heaven. I'm trying to prepare my way of explaining it to her when she asks me about it, tell me if this sounds good:  "Well, a lot of people believe that when we die, we go to a special place called Heaven. Grandma, Grandpa and a few people we know believe this, but they don't know for sure. NOBODY knows for sure if it's real or not or even what it's like. We DO know that when we die, some people have these very realistic dreams and sometimes people go to heaven in these dreams where they'll be happy. Sometimes they see old friends or family members who made them happy. Sometimes they go to their favorite place in the world that made them happy in life. I think this is why people want heaven to be real, they want to be happy. But it's far more important to be happy here and now, while you can. Dying is a natural part of life... we're given a short time on this earth to experience happiness, sadness, anger, delicious food, fun, responsibility, and to do or create something important that makes everyone else's lives better. As for what happens when that time is over... NOBODY knows, even if they tell you they do. NOONE knows because noone's ever lived to tell about it.
