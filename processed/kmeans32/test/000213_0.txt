you pretty much stop flopping around positions long before you get to 55.  That's actually a bad thing. Not that you should flip your position just for the sake of it, but there's also a natural progress in human behavior, and I hope that when I'll be in my 50's I'll still be open to see that's going in the world, what's working and what's not - and adapt accordingly.   I don't see any shame in saying "I used to think like that, but times have changed and I changed my mind". Better than the opposite.

This is BS article.  1. If we want regulated markets that protect small investors from doing stupid shit with their money, that's a reasonable and accepted part of the plan.  2. Most startups won't even accept investments of less than few hundred thousands dollars. So it makes sense to limit the investment to "accredited investors".   3. If you do have half a million dollar, and it's all your money, and you really want to invest in some start up despite better judgement, there are easy and legal ways to achieve that.   4. Most start ups fail. You know what else fails? This article. It doesn't mention the hundreds of start ups that go bust and give zero money back to investors, but instead keeps dropping names like Facebook and Linked In.  5. Most of the "accredited investors" are white men, but how is this relevant? It's like saying the Yacht market is blocked to black people. Wealth inequality exists,so let's deal with it. I don't see any added value by putting it in a stock market regulation article.

You are right about the separation, but would you vote for someone that says it's immoral to marry black people? Sure, he won't criminalize it, but he thinks it's wrong.    Saying it's a "moral crisis" brings us back decades as far as understanding gay people.   I personally don't think that it's a make or break for a president, but it's a sure one big minus.   I also expect his position to turn if he wins the Republican nomination and moves to the national stage. There's no way he's going to stick with the moral argument on general election.
Oh thanks. Obviously I'm not going to take this test because I know exactly where I land. (Hint: there are many like them, but this is mine)
Sure, who doesn't? I love my piss and I think it pairs well with rosemary garlic bread. It's understandable however, if a post with my piss in tall glass and pickles on the side will be removed from /r/food.
Out if curiosity I googled season 5 reviews, with 2 weeks time range before the premier. Top results that aren't fan sites: telegraph, frobes, independent, cnet and ew - can't say I'm surprised. Exactly where the current generation hangs out. io9 btw, reported from premier event in SF (probably 1-2 episodes?), which, again, makes much more sense than mass mailing shitty quality DVD.
Another way of putting it is "Shaq had Kobe". God, the 2000-2002 Lakers were a real Force majeure. I'm glad I was there to watch them... even if I hated every moment of it. I suddenly remember all the frustration. Like you had start the 4th with at least 20 points lead or you wouldn't have a chance.

The movie is an almost 20 years old sci-fi and still holds well today. On top of comedy, action and drama blend there's also great timing and a very nice soundtrack. Not a single dead minute in that movie.   It's also worth noting that it was the second movie Luc Besson directed and wrote in English (after Leon: The Professional, which is also worth watching in case anybody missed it). Great launch to his career.
I think it's much more complicated than that. [](#s "He's being an asshole, right. But he's also a scapegoat, a victim, an outcast and totally depended on their good will. He built trust, and he was able to being an asshole in a personal way.") I think it was written nicely.

Well, people mentioned the bike. I'll add that you gonna need to train for that distance. If you do 30km, double it to 60 (do the same route twice), and then 120km. You'll need to get used to being so long on your bikes, learn your pace, see how you handle water and food (with 30km you don't need to eat, with 100km you most certainly do, or your legs will stop working).
