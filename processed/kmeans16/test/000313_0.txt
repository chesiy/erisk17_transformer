Thank you, that really does mean a lot to hear. Honestly
Elegy of Death - Horror style piano
Ode to Ambiguity - A relaxing piano instrumental

Yeah, haha... I felt the same way when I added them in
I guess that means I'm doing my job right, hahah ^^;
You're a lot like me, haha. A lot of people find my music to be terrifying, but I personally love listening to it.

For Shaco players
So it's just for the novelty of acquiring friends in an unlikely environment? I appreciate the kind of satisfaction you must find from that, but it can still be argued that it's immoral to purposefully team up with someone in a game lobby where players are explicitly deciding to play every man for themselves. It's the classic "my needs are greater than your needs" complex, but the satisfaction of the few "unfair" players hardly outweighs the satisfaction the players who are being cheated out of the game style their suggested.
I composed a song for Shaco   For any other Shaco mains who like listening to creepy carnival musics when they play Shaco, or just anyone who's interested in hearing music inspired by a League champion, I'd love it if you checked out my composition inspired by Shaco.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOvbZKBJOQ4
