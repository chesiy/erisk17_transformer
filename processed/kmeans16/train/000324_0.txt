Erasing the ending from your mind more than likely won't be possible, but I've read the book and the clues Q picks up on can still interest you. Try to say no to your temptation of googling the ending of a book and remind yourself that it'll just ruin the book, this would be one of those things you can add to your list of experiences.
Fuck a monkey.
The cat?
'Yeah what a loser'. Now if you excuse me I have to sit here refreshing the page every 20 seconds looking for new posts for a game that comes out in 140 days.
Warlords?
From my memory, they said that these skins would be exclusive until the event ended, and once it ended, they'd no longer be available :/ .Well thanks for clearing this up, guess my memory didn't serve correctly.
I may have missed something along the line, but what Hel skin is this, and what did you have to do to obtain it?
I do believe it's a harpoon.
9mm rounds
Yeah, but it does make a difference when one team has a Guan Yu and the other team has nobody to heal.
What game is it?
If that happened in rank.. no no, but the reason Apollo can support is the protections he gains from his mez (in case you were wondering). Also, you need to try two junglers, just get somebody who can play safely on ADC and maybe have them play Neith.
Another piece of advice is actives, while beads can be really good, on a support it would be wiser to get something that helps your team, e.g. heavenly agility, shell or creeping curse. And would be nice to get a reply for feedback but can't since it is only for ranked, but looking at your stats you didn't seem to have done bad. If you have any questions feel free to PM me.
I play a fair amount of conquest and these all seem normal picks to me but I can still run Neith solo, Ra mid/solo, (Can't jungle). What servers do you play on, NA or EU?
Support Apollo
Neith being my favorite god, I would love this.
