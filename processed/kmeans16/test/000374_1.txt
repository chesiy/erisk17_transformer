You're gonna make it. You're one of the very few people I see that knows they're depressed and **wants** to get help. That's really great to see.  If you feel that a stay in the hospital would be fitting for you, I'd advise to not shy away from it. While it was a hard experience, it gives a person the tools they need to really begin to start changing their life.  If you want to look into therapy, try out this awesome resource: https://therapists.psychologytoday.com/rms/  Put in your zip, instantly get a lot of therapists around you - and you can sort by price per session (it shows what insurances they accept). I've personally gone with a therapist off there who offered $35 per session over the table, and it's one of the best choices I ever made.  That website allows you to send emails directly to each therapist, and in emailing 4 that I saw, I found that they all reply really quickly.  Just introduce yourself, and ask what their availability is like :)
Holy shit.
His is of the more strange profiles that I've sifted through.  Reminder: don't Witch-hunt down vote someone's profile. Hope I didn't instigate any of that.
Dude          That username
Ahah, man. This would work as a crosspost to /r/funny as well.
I'd say something exactly like that about the istick 50w, tbh. I haven't been on here in a couple weeks and just now am seeing this giant craze of everyone throwing out their eleaf products. If I hadn't known about that I'd still say that my iStick 50w is freaking awesome. I haven't had a single issue with it. Everyone raves about good products they have on here, and every day that I'm on here I see someone raving about how an order they placed got fulfilled and actually got to their doorstep. I don't know if I'd go as far as to say that just because they're raving happy about the istick that they're an eleaf rep.
Don't have a serial number. Wanted to chime in and say that I got my 50w via the SmogGB directly from eleaf, and have had it for almost 2 months, and have had no problems at all. It is the only power source I've used since getting it, and I treat it like a baby. Hardly ever even sees my pocket, as my shitty dripper leaks everywhere. I carried over the habit from my mech mod of turning it off after each time I'm done using it. If you are worried about flames, buy lipo safety bag for under $20 online. No matter what vape I'm charging overnight, the first three charges are always in the bag.  if it's ever charging and I'm not home, it's in the bag.
Reminds me of the [I'm Drunk AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/drunk/comments/2gjf7u/im_drunk_ama/) where a guy got shasted, asked himself questions, answered his own questions, and then publically berated his own answers to his own questions.  "Can confirm. Have same dick."
Thank you so much :). Happy to share a smile. I've seen quite a few success stories around here and I've been waiting to be able to have one to share.
I never said that I thought it was in one take. Ive watched a few videos in my day, I understand when something could be one take and when it may not. Regardless of this, it's pretty cool.

Not weird at all, my friend. That's why it's growing exponentially in popularity. If you feel interested in looking for a setup, you can let me know, or check out /r/electronic_cigarette (hit or miss nowadays). I've done quite a bit of research on electronic cigarettes, and from what I've seen from the data, its a much healthier alternative. My bronchi tells me otherwise after about a year and a half, but I have yet to prove that it's due to vaping, and it seems to be a very isolated experience that I'm having.   It IS, however, trading an addiction for another if you choose to use nicotine(all Eliquids also come in nicotine free versions!) - but I truly enjoy it and it's a much more manageable addiction due to the ability to fully customize your nicotine intake.
Sorry to see that you're getting a lot of negative feedback here. I think you asked a good question. Companies offer discreet shipping for reasons like this. I wish maybe a moderator would handle some of the senseless vulgar fighting - none of that belongs in this subreddit, nor was it here when I joined. If you don't like a post, you have the option of down voting it and moving on.   Edit: instead of a moderator trying to help you out, one of them is in here dissing you for wanting to pick up vaping.   /u/LazyPancake  /u/Lynda73,  how did this subreddit come to this? This is supposed to be a welcoming and helpful community for both those who want to quit smoking and those who want to pick up vaping, regardless of their reasoning.   Edit^2: I guess LazyPancake isn't a mod, although he posts the daily questions threads. That changes the whole situation greatly.  Edit^3: sorry, LazyPancake, that I've made you mad. Thanks for going through my profile and down voting 45 of my posts.

She's pretty! Looks good!
