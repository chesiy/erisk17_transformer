Fuck your stupid cat
Best pray u don't come waltzing in my forest with that stupid animal.. One swift kick to the face is all it needs
For a second I thought you said "some girls that actually saw it and BLACKED out" I was like, now that is some power right there
I was about 90% sure I was going to die that night. He could have done it so easily and my co worker didn't give him all the money (although the robber didn't know that) bt if he did that would have been all the reason he needed to do me in. When I think back about it, there are so many things I wish I would have done, but in the moment there was no chance I would have actually done it. But it is interesting to look at the situation from a few different ways in my head. I will have to check out that book tho, sounds interesting to me, especially now
Looked more like puffin to me
Get the fuck outta here if u don't care
Thanks so much!!
It's my grandfathers 90th today and I have an old photo from WWII of him and I would not do it justice on Photoshop, so I figured I would put it here. Anything is so much appreciated by my family!
It's sad that this has happened so many times that this warning is now needed.
Found this in the free section of Craigslist...I hope its a joke but moreover I hope no one picks it up...
Ok I appreciate that! I am opening up my DAW as we speak!

If you think I'm a hipster with the pbr comment...you are way way off base my friend...i forgot tho that you came out of your moms vagina on a Steve Lis and never were a kook...I hope you never try something new again so you can always stay in top of your game bro..
I appreciate that. I am sure the other guys would feel the same way if they were here right now. We try to leave a lot up to the listener and allow them to really make what they want of it. The parts that grab you are intended to do exactly that and the rest is up to the listener :) be on the look out for the new album. Once its done I will put it online for free download to anyone who wants it. I will probably put a post on reddit for it :)
Hahaha thanks, someone at the bar the other night made the same comment and I had to google it to see bc I couldnt remember..good call tho
living in San Diego and being a padres fan and trying to get a job with them myself, this is awesome and I hope she finds work!
