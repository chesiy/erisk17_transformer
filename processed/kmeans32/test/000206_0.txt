Samsara. Basically shows a bunch of different cultures with zero dialogue so no language barrier.
I also thought it was weird that Ryan was so appalled to learn that the dude donated his body to save his daughter. Like, it makes sense and is a great sacrifice.  I think it's funny that the entire film wouldn't have happened if he did what Goode said and just didn't poke around.  Also, I kind of ended up agreeing with Goode's character, Albright. He was kind of right in that most medical breakthroughs had sacrifices. Reynolds was just being a nosy ungrateful dude.
The writing wasn't terrible, the acting was good, the cinematography was good, and the directing was fine. In fact, it's no secret that a lot was cut for theatrical release.   It's an average film, and if it wasn't a remake, people would be okay with it. I've seen both. I strongly believe that if people have the ability to see both, they should choose the original. Just like everyone else. However, if you only had the option to see the Lee one, for whatever reason, it's not bad.   It's subpar to the original, but for the most part tells the same story without much change. That's why it's not a bad remake. Just unnecessary. As a film though, from a technical standpoint, it's not bad.

I'm going to throw Robert Pattinson out there. I think he's shown he has acting chops, looks young, right body type, and can do an American accent. Don't know about wittiness though. He does seem fun in interviews.  And if it weren't for Xmen, I'd say Nicholas Hoult.  But if we're talking about more realistic choices, I agree with those saying Logan Lerman.
This sub is meant to be a bridge between /r/movies and /r/truefilm. I think my post, while not great, does fit here. I don't know if you were the one that downvoted my reply to you or not, but I feel it was unjustified. You asked me to be a bit more descriptive and I told you that I wasn't great at articulating and gave you two reasons why I didn't find it great.   Then in reply you basically told me my post was bad and didn't belong here. I don't blame you for expecting higher quality posts, but that attitude is kind of why people are intimidated by /r/truefilm, and is why this sub was created. To be a more formal /r/movies and a more casual /r/truefilm.
I think all the movies you listed are great. And I think Memento should be there with them. Like I said, a true film buff like yourself doesn't think Memento is a bold film, but the vast majority of average moviegoers do. So I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree.
I still have a lot to see but so far...  The Rover  The Drop  Guardians of the Galaxy  Edge of Tomorrow  The Raid 2  The Lego Movie  The Grand Budapest Hotel  X Men: Days of Future Past  22 Jump Street  Dawn of the Planet of the Apes  Under the Skin  Gone Girl
Well for one I never claimed to know the absolute truth. And I never said I was more right than a Jew or Catholic. I'm just a dude on the internet who likes movies and doesn't like reading.   I also never claimed anything specific to be anti Mormon. Like you said, I probably never read the stuff you talked about. So it didn't really make since to me why you'd bring that stuff up when I never claimed anything specifically, and especially not the stuff you brought up, to be anti Mormon or hostile. It was all kind of irrelevant. You asking me what about all those publications is hostile is a weird question when I didn't say any of them were. You simply asked me to define "anti Mormon". So I did.
The 3 kinds of comments in this post:  "Fuck Gamestop" Yeah yeah we've heard it all before.   "This is why I pirate games. Because I'm sending a message to the man!" No it's not. You pirate because you'd rather get something for free.   And finally, "This should be in the game. I bet it was but they just took it out." You should not be surprised and should expect this by now. I'm with you in that it sucks, but this is normal now. In fact it's weird if games don't have preorder bonuses now.
I can't speak for everyone, but what made it great for me was the theme of fathers and sons. I have a close relationship with my father and this movie really got to me emotionally. I also really loved the fact that it felt like a Greek tragedy play with its clear three act structure. I can totally see people not liking it though. I thought the reveal of what happens to Gosling's character was a great twist I didn't see coming.   I don't know if it will be considered a classic, but it will always be one of my all time favorites.
I honestly think he stole the show. Which isn't easy to do when you're co staring with other great actors. I always wanted him to be great because I knew he had the capacity to be a great actor. He really showed what he could do. One of the best, if not the best, performance by an actor so far this year.
Samsara. Quite possibly *the best* looking blu ray out there. Jaw droppingly gorgeous.  The Tree of Life is another stunning film. The creation of the universe scene *has* to be seen on blu ray.  No Country for Old Men is another great blu ray addition, as well as the 2009 Star Trek.  Only God Forgives was one of the most beautiful movies to come out last year. Absolutely stellar cinematography. The look and music of this film are enough to warrant a blind buy if you've never seen it.  The Matrix is a great one as well. Especially the Ultimate Matrix Collection box set that has 35 hours of bonus features. That alone makes it worth it even if the film itself doesn't look good, which it does in fact look great!  Immortals, while a not great movie, is beautiful. Now is that enough to warrant a buy? That's up for debate, but since you can get it for a cheap price, it's not a bad addition.  Fantastic Mr. Fox is a great addition! Especially now that it has a Criterion release. This is a very pretty film that looks stunning on blu ray.  Lastly, 300. This film has some of the most beautiful cinematography of the last decade. I find it to be a must own blu ray, but that's just me.
Yeah, probably.
I don't know really anything about lenses. I'm trying to find a wide angle lens that has really good image quality.   I have a rebel t3i and I'm about to start work on a short. What I do know is I want to use a wide angle lens. What I don't know is what to look for. I have no clue what all the numbers mean.   What are some wide angle lenses that don't produce a lot of noise and grain and have a good, clean image? Price really isn't a factor because I'd be renting the lens.
Oh look at you! You're so slick!  But seriously, there rally aren't many alternatives. I love film. It's my passion. But most of the people over at truefilm are not really welcoming and are happy to tear you apart at any given moment if you sound uneducated in film.   There's casualfilm, which is a fantastic subreddit, but unfortunately there's not a lot of activity. Maybe like 3 or 4 post a week.   There really aren't a lot of alternatives. So it's either unsub and don't get any movie related stuff, or deal with it and get crappy movie related stuff. But I guess we do what we have to do?  If you know any other good movie related subs for quality content, I more than welcome you to point me in the right direction.
I hate you so much, I'm so jealous!! I really wish the US got more steel books. I wonder why we don't. Great collection by the way!
Well I'm 7 days late but thought I'd still talk.  I'm in sort of the same situation. Filmmaker as well. However I do have at least one friend who I've been working with frequently. The problem is we are very different in our tastes and styles and he is unwilling to compromise, so we have started to hit walls when trying to come up with ideas.  I'm trying to broaden the amount of people to work with, but everyone else isn't as serious about it as I am. Everyone just wants to do it for fun, which is fine for them, but I want to make a career out of it whereas they have other careers in mind(doctor, lawyer, etc.,). So this leads to situations where I either have to work with my stubborn, uncompromising friend or work with people who goof off too much and don't care.  Too bad you and I don't live near each other(as far as I know. I'm assuming.). We seem to share the same interest.
You know what? I just might skype you. Are you available after 8? Cause I really do need someone to walk me through it in real time.
Wow this was totally my idea in the first place as a joke, but I'm happy someone is actually making it happen! Exciting!  http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ze5f8/official_oscar_thread_2014/cfsxtux?context=3
Fuck.  It doesn't really make sense. In fact, a lot of the time "fuck" and its derivatives are frequently used purely to bridge thoughts and sentences.   There are plenty of words we could say in it's place, but it *is* useful to express certain emotions. It's the same with any swear word really. They don't make a lot of sense, there are plenty of words that could be said in their place, but they do a good job of expressing certain emotions.
In person? I saw a dead cat. But the way I saw it was like something out of a movie.  I was asked to take care of my neighbor's cat while she was gone for Christmas. One day I went over and saw Mulligan, that's the cat's name, sitting in the bedroom with foamy drool hanging from his mouth and he was making weird noises. I took him to the vet and the vet said it's probably just stress and to not worry about it. "It might go away when the owner gets back."  So a few days later I walk over to my neighbors house to feed him and check up on him. I opened the door and the whole house is silent except for the Beethoven-esque music playing on the radio(we turned the radio on to keep Mulligan company). So this beautiful orchestra music is playing and I look down the hall and all I see is his tail sticking out. I called his name and he didn't respond.  I walked down the hall and there was Mulligan, dead. He was laying next to his toy, too. I checked to see if he was breathing and maybe just passed out. He was stiff as a plank of wood. He was gone at least 12 hours.  The whole thing was very eerie and morbid with the quiet calm house and this beautiful orchestra music echoing through the house. Sad day. Apparently he had a stroke.  I also hit a golden retriever once with my car when I was in high school. That was a tough day.
Yes this is it! Thanks!
What are some things to do in Memphis by yourself and still get enjoyment?   So my friends are super busy with college and work so we rarely get to hang out, but I love going out. I hate sitting at home by myself.   What are some places or activities where I could go by myself and still have fun and get enjoyment and not feel weird being alone?
You need to get your expectations straight before you see OGF. It's not Drive. Visually it's similar, but Drive is a lot more straight forward and easier to watch. If you go into OGF with the expectations that it's like Drive you won't enjoy it as much. It is incredibly slow. It takes its time. More so than Drive. It is more like Refn's Valhalla Rising. I'd say that if you like Drive than there is a good chance you'll like OGF, just don't expect it to be another Drive. If you don't mind movies that take their time and are really slow, then give it a watch.
That's funny cause I just saw it and I thought it felt rushed.
Leonard Cohen - Hallelujah (Alter Bridge Acoustic)
[TOMT] [Song] Looking for a song with a strange beat and rhythm.   I heard a song at work today and loved the beat and rhythm of it, but don't know what it is. I know it's fairly recent because we only pay recent music, but not top forty stuff. I've never heard this song anywhere else before. I know one lyric, "I'll love you until the end of time." Or something like that. It's a pop song with a sort of middle eastern beat/rhythm to it however the singer sounds American. I know that at the end of the song he says, "Until theee eeeeennnndddd ooooof tiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiime."  The song has a pretty chill sound to it. It's not a slow love song. Definitely more of a pop song.  I know this isn't a lot to go on, but it's all I got.   Edit: New details: Most likely male singer. Also I should clarify what I mean by recent. What I mean by recent is like this year.
What are some good movies to show to a group of people from the ages of 18-23?   So me and some friends are doing a movie night Friday and I'm trying to figure out what to show.   A little info on my friends. They don't like slow paced movies and would rather not watch a drama unless its interesting and has good pace. They like just about any genre but would prefer either a horror, comedy, action or any combination of those. I think above all though the thing that matters most is if its interesting and has good pacing. I don't want to bore them. I showed them There Will Be Blood once and I could feel the awkward boredom in the room.   Also I'd prefer something that didn't come out in the last two years. Thanks guys!
