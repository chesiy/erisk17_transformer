Haha not even, this guys comment was breaking a rule. He ruined are thin veil of realism. That sucks.
No. Its not.
Disregard. Forgive me.
Okay. I swear to fuck if thats how chief looks final product im going to shit a brick. What the hell is up with the grey under thing what the fuck, halo 4's looks way more fucking detailed. Dont even get me started on the fucking visor. Edit: dont you even downvote me because i fucking love this game and its like 343 is using my balls as punching bags
Please no.   "Hrey giuz urts krus frum herlofuloower"
I am a beautiful person. The other side, but the most of us are on your site law, to the right now, I have been in a while, and the restaurant is the most part, but I think I have a great day.
But its a fucking comic book. Captain America isn't real. Do you understand that? His morals dont count, his actions are not real. You can criticize the reading, but for what? He brought jews into this haha he's just trying to push his own agenda.
I saw this too. So sad.
Lol its not really hard to notice he main character (lasky) and seeing chief. Pretty self explanatory.
Alrighty.
I SAID "DOCTOR OCTOPUS" ON A COOL GIF ALBUM THING. AMA!
Yo momma you lazy little shit.   "The largest exoplanet ever discovered is also one of the strangest and theoretically should not even exist, scientists say. Dubbed TrES-4, the planet is about 1.7 times the size of Jupiter and belongs to a small subclass of so-called puffy planets that have extremely low densities. The planet is located about 1,400 light years away from Earth and zips around its parent star in only three and a half days."
Okay now im contemplating why they wouldn't come out, you'd have a 'survival' card. Lets say the actor unexpectedly dies, we the people have evidence of the government killing a 'whistleblower' if you will.
Well no one wants to die right? I meant think of all the things the government can do to you, like all those torture tactics that they use.
Shite.
Terraforming?
Watch you're mouth son.
Tifu, by trusting a fart and almost killing a child.   No throw away because I'm a man, or I'm really fucking stupid.  This happened today, so happy everyone? Anyways, i work at a kids store because I'm 17 and extra cash comes in handy.   I ate Chipotle for lunch and "Mexican" food and i don't mix okay? So i clock back in and start greeting in the front of the store then it happens, my stomach feels as if there is a small chihuahua having a fucking party in my bowels. I started making my way to the back when i just need to pass gas, so i let it propel me but little do i know that there is a small child behind me that just experienced the smell of a bad burrito.  First of all it smelled like a dead whale, second, this fart was loud as fuck, third, i need to change my pants. I look at the kid with horror,  he looks at me with a disgusted look on his face while his mother stares me down with the anger of a bull who just got neutered. She just turned away as she dragged her child. I embarrassingly waddled to the restroom and went commando.   Tldr; Never trust a mexican induced fart.
Omaha!
i love you.
(:
You love this shitty country? This country that kills its innocent civilians? Im not saying i give up, im just pointing out that our 'privacy' has been in the government's hands before any of us even thought that our precious country would do such a thing. This "country" for a lack of a better word is too far gone. I care about myself and whats going to happen to me in these dark dark days, im not rolling over and dying im just pointing out the obvious.

Thank you.
You dont need her, its sad to live your life by having to look over your shoulder because someone is stalking you, especially if that person is your own mother. Some people are just sick. No offense OP.
Well how could a hardcore 'nerd' not know what the Spider-Verse is and who is in it. Get outta here dick breath.
Its alright, point is, you tried to help. Thank you nevertheless!
Worst day is black friday, honestly, like one time i was in this arcade playing rockband and i looked out to the mall and it was empty! I thought "its closing time already?" I left the arcade and there were some thieves in the mall and it was a totally crazy experience, they actually made a movie about me, pretty cool if you ask me. They mixed up my real name (Baul Plart) anyways my mom just made some sweet potatoe fried so BRB.
