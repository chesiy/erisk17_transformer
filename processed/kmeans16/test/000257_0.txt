I've only read three books published in 2015 this year, and I've only liked one of them, *Haints Stay* by Colin Winnette. I really enjoyed it, but I don't think it will be my favorite of the year come January. That said, if you are looking for a nice western with spare prose that mixes violence and beauty you will enjoy it.
I highly doubt most people are censoring themselves - more a case of thinking "Wow, that guy is a huge dick", and by extension losing interest in the book.  I know personally this is the case for me. If someone like Card wrote something I wanted to read, I'd still read it, just find a way to do so where I'm not monetarily supporting the author...
no
* Sam Pink - Rontel/Person  * Scott McClanahan - Crapalachia/Hill William/Collected Works  * Megan Boyle - selected unpublished blog posts of a mexican panda express employee  recommend starting with Scott, easily one of my favorite authors
Cool, that rarely happens and that made me smile.  I can see how he could come off as obnoxious, but stuff like directing As I Lay Dying and Child of God made me respect him, and I've seen him supporting lesser known works like *Scarecrone* by Melissa Broder and *Black Cloud* by Juliet Escoria on his social media. Plus I like his stoner movies :)

I will usually get most of my books from the library, so usually the only books I buy are the ones I have trouble finding for free. As such, my latest purchase is exclusively indie books my library system will never get their hands on that have been building up on my to-read list for a while.  * *Crapalachia: A Biography of Place* - Scott McClanahan * *Hill William* - Scott McClanahan * *The Collected Works of Scott McClanahan Vol. 1* -Scott McClanahan * *Witch Piss* - Sam Pink * *The No Hellos Diet* - Sam Pink * *I Am Going to Clone Myself Then Kill the Clone and Eat It* - Sam Pink * *Hurt Others* -Sam Pink * *Crystal Eaters* - Shane Jones * *Black Cloud* - Juliet Escoria
Rather than saying "Wow, OP", why not try to add some actual discussion to the card? I do not think this card is very strong. It's a mediocre card. Visions of drawing 2 Antonidases, Rags, etc, are flowing through everyone's heads, And maybe if a control mage type deck becomes playable, this card could be a strong lategame piece.   For draft? It's pretty bad, worse than arcane intellect in my opinion. Every competent draft player plays around secrets already, so this card clashes hard with a lot of cards - hex, imp master, razorfen hunter, harvest golem token, silverhand recruit, violet teacher, etc.    You will of course get some nice value some of the time, but most times, the card is going to be way harder to successfully pull off than you think, especially in draft.
Can't go wrong with anything by Flannery O'connor or Cormac McCarthy. I recommend Donald Ray Pollock all of the time, The Devil All the Time and Knockemstiff are both great. These books lean more to the southern gothic genre.  2666 is a great book.  There's a lot of horror on the list that is good as well - Lovecraft, Ligotti, Barron, Bierce, etc - good as well but not really like True Detective aside from the King in Yellow/Carcosa connection.
Something should be done about opponent inactivity   As of recently, I'd say more than 50% of my opponents mysteriously go inactive once it becomes clear they've lost, almost always returning once their timer hits around 2-3 minutes left in hopes that I've left to scum out a win.  Some modes it matters a little more than others (play vs. draft), but it makes the game unplayable in bite sized doses unless you're willing to lose or babysit your opponent for up to 15 minutes while doing nothing.  I understand implementing a turn timer or inactivity timer won't universally be an improvement for all, but something should be implemented by SB to combat this, it's a real enjoyment killer.
no kidding...
If you think that $60 is too much to ask to opt into a beta, then just wait until release. For them to release the game at any less of a price would be spitting in the face of the people who are the largest fans and backed them on Kickstarter.  The game is speculated to be in the $20-30 range on release, so I don't see what the big deal is.
It is definitely a cumulative experience - the more you read, the more you want to read, and the easier it becomes. Find an author or genre you like to read and start there, but don't be afraid to branch out into new genres or experiences. Reading is the best, welcome.
Priests are this game's control deck, OTK Hunters are this game's combo deck. Looking at tournament results and hearing opinions from top players, neither of these heroes are very good at the moment in comparison to some of the top classes.  Crying to nerf or change a class that isn't very good in the first place is crazy. Hearthstone needs variety in playstyles. Cutting the control and combo elements from a game is a horrible idea, and just devolves the game into an all aggro deck fest where who can curve out the best wins.  Maybe control or combo isn't fun for you, but playing aggro vs. aggro every match doesn't sound very fun to me.

Looking for a fun local co-op game to play with my wife   Looking for something fun to pass the time - I'm a big gamer, and my wife is no stranger to gaming either, but not as hardcore.  We have been looking for something fun on emulator (nes/snes/genesis), but can't find much that isn't a button mashing beat em up. Next gen suggestions are ok too, as well as pc.  Things we have played - Castle crashers Secret of mana Legend of the mystical ninja Various snes beat em ups Lego games (not a big fan, though she is)  Thanks in advance
