Hey man and thanks for answer,   Yeah I really enjoy the "filling" feeling, but I thought something with some kind of knot would be nice.   I know that plug is pretty small and I have no problem to go like 2 or more times deeper.   I was thinking about going for the Chance since I like the knot at the head of it, or shape of it (not sure how to call it), but lately I was considering something with big knot.  I would like to get something that would challenge me, but wouldnt be crazy overkill.   About the firmness, I wasnt really thinking about it, but I think that Firm would be the go-to.   Yeah Im ordering to Czech Republic so Im prepared to pay some extra, but I can deal with that.
[M] Long time lurker looking for first toy   Hello guys Im 18 years old guy who found out about Bad Dragon recently and i must say i totaly love this ! I love the people around here and all the stuff that bad dragon produces, I m just student so my money balance is pretty bad but I decided to get myself something to play with.   So here s the thing.    I m not sure what to go with, I already have (not bad dragon) [this](http://www.lovehoney.co.uk/product.cfm?p=6406) home and I can get myself open pretty good i think.  (probably not enough for large Chance, but thats pretty hardcore :))   So the thing is can you guys gimme some recommendations for what toy would be good for me ? If you wanna know something feel free to ask, I can also provide with photos if it will be of any help :) , or you might enjoy it :) .    Thanks for reading such a long post and I m sorry if I made any English mistakes :)

yeah i have to agree- the power of friendship beacuse we run out of   source matreial is just sad. But the part stickin to manga is really   well done and the manga was actually one of the best thing i ever read.
Try Soul Eater
* How the fuck do i get rid of that emptiness inside when i finish a new anime?      Thats the hardest part, best way is probably filling hole with another series    also: My first anime was Soul Eater, after i finished it i felt big hole, but then i got the manga and read it and i felt way better, yeah and watching AMV of series you just finished will also help (at least for me it does)      * Is there a way to control the "just one more episode and i'll go to bed"?      Cant answer you on that one, its 5am here and Im sitting here watching anime.      * I've spent way to much time on anime lately, so now that i'm into anime, is there a way out?      Why would you want to get out ? Its like trying to jump out of luxury train, why would you do it ?
Well i would probably say Soul Eater  or Noragami  also Black Bullet (curently airing)
