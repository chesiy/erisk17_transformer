If we would just take this victims gun rights from him the police would protect him from the carjacker.

Watch for signs on Texas multi-lane highways that read "Left Lane For Passing Only." These signs let you know that the left lane on a divided highway is not a "fast" lane; it is a passing lane.   After you pass someone, move into the right lane once you've safely cleared the vehicle. Impeding the flow of traffic by continuing to drive in the left lane is punishable by a fine of up to $200.

lol Bill Clinton raided SS to give the illusion of a surplus. Do you pay attention to specifics? And you still have yet to give me Hillarys accomplishments? What are her accomplishments?   As a civilian, she was a member of Walmart's board of directors for 6 years fighting against living wages, benefits, gender equality, and the right of workers to organize.  As senator, she voted for the Iraq War, the bank bailouts, and the Patriot Act.   As secretary of state, she incited, funded, and armed Libyan rebels to create the "justification" for America's illegal and unprovoked war against Libya.
That was the reason for my original comment. Anyone that would vote for a party regardless of who they are and what their positions are, are part of the problem. Rand Paul and Berney Sanders are the only candidates worth looking at, IMO.

The only solution is a bigger government. Need more of them taxes too.
"I would say it is the most secretive White House that I have ever been involved in covering, and that includes  I spent 22 years of my career in Washington and covered presidents from President Reagan on up through now, and I was Washington bureau chief of the Times during George W. Bush's first term, I dealt directly with the Bush White House when they had concerns that stories we were about to run put the national security under threat. But, you know, they were not pursuing criminal leak investigations," she continued. "The Obama administration has had seven criminal leak investigations. That is more than twice the number of any previous administration in our history. It's on a scale never seen before. This is the most secretive White House that, at least as a journalist, I have ever dealt with." - Former New York Times Executive Editor Jill Abramson, January 2014
Whats that, you damn commie bastard?
Shows the kind of man he was. Understood what he was up against and made the right calls to get it done. That's what we call a leader, here in the States. Now look at Britain.. Couldn't protect themselves from a paper cut without the US military.  "Checkmate" - George Washington
Racists are bigots but that does not mean bigots are racist. A racist is someone who believes in the superiority of one race over another, or who acts differently (usually negatively) towards a person or a group of people because of their race. A bigot is a blinkered, narrow-minded person, usually also very intolerant and unable to see anyone else's point of view. People can be bigoted about things that have nothing to do with race.
I have been using Avast Endpoint Protection Plus on my servers -Per server license comes in 5pack. It has an Exchange feature. It can be pushed to clients. Its cheap and gets the job done. It's not the greatest solution on the market but if you need cheap it works. It is not as robust as Groupshield but has been great at capturing any type of infected file trying to get through and has a decent spam filter.
I was not trashing your post. I am trashing our elected officials. I am very happy to see this still in discussion. I am just pointing out that we need to do more. We need to guarantee the passage and enforcement of this legislation. We are the voters. We are the only ones who can enforce it. The fact that all we ever have is discussion and nothing actually happens is not where we want to be. I appreciate your post and your continued efforts to keep the word out.
Just trying to understand where you think you can move that is *not* under the protection of the US Military, has a better human rights record, and was not involved in the secret rendition program. Enjoy your pick of many 3rd world countries. Just do us a favor... after you reach your new destination, and realize how great you had it in the States, do not come crawling back to the US. We don't take too kindly to traitors like you.
It says right there in the contract what the interest will be when you fail to pay the loan on time. It says right there. And this was not this kids only option.. give me a break. If he was so down on his luck and could not afford to live then he should have sold his ipad, iphone, shut off his internet, his cable tv, and just got the basics in life. He chose to use payday loans because getting rid of the other "needs", they are wants not needs, was too unbearable to think of.
I understand. Glad this will work for you. Enjoy your day.
I do see, from that link, that Fergusons violent crime averages are much higher than the US average. I would like to see 30 years of crime and demographic data on Ferguson. I have heard others mention that Ferguson was not a violent town until something changed. Jobs left and crime went on the climb.I wonder what changed to cause this shift.

What Michael Brown's autopsy tells us
Rand Paul. Because he is not a Democrat and established Republicans don't like him. And he fights for the Constitution.
My company doesnt provide a benefit? lol If my company went out of business almost 1000 people would lose their jobs and there is nothing in this area that would be able to fill them. So they would become an even more drain on the social system than they already are. If they want to make more money. They need to go get training and learn a skill that demands more money. And if increasing worker pay causes inflation to the point where the increase in pay is depleted by inflation cost in goods purchased then they would be in the same place they are now. Still requiring subsidies. On top of that my company pays out $millions$ in healthcare costs to subsidize the employees healthcare. Just like many businesses do. If we did not subsidize their healthcare they would be an even bigger drain on  social services.
Judge rules Chicago gun ban is unconstitutional
"I have already intimated to you the danger of parties in the State, with particular reference to the founding of them on geographical discriminations. Let me now take a more comprehensive view, and warn you in the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the spirit of party generally.      This spirit, unfortunately, is inseparable from our nature, having its root in the strongest passions of the human mind. It exists under different shapes in all governments, more or less stifled, controlled, or repressed; but, in those of the popular form, it is seen in its greatest rankness, and is truly their worst enemy.      The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge, natural to party dissension, which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is itself a frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal and permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries which result gradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the absolute power of an individual; and sooner or later the chief of some prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his competitors, turns this disposition to the purposes of his own elevation, on the ruins of public liberty."      George Washington, Farewell Address - Letter written To The People of The United States
All I heard from Kerry yesterday is that we must "protect Israel".. How about we let Israel protect themselves for a change. We have had too many American brothers and sisters killed or maimed protecting Israel while the Israelis sit on their couch and watch. You are the Secretary of State for the United States of America, not of Israel.
So he will overlook the use by the rebels just to save face? Are you ok with this? To me the man doesnt have much credibility left. And if he condones the use of Sarin by the Rebels, but not the regime, then he will lose even more credibility. His red line should be for anyone using Sarin. This isn't a game. I think we just need to stay out of it. Its not our fight. Are we going to have to go to war with these rebels in 15 years after arming them to the teeth?

What would we need to do to get Al Gore, a former Vice President, to become an outspoken proponent of our cause. I dont know if I posted this in the correct place or whether you see relevance in this post. I just wanted to bring it to the attention of the sub.

Al Roker: 'I Pooped My Pants'
"Mr. Obama repeatedly lost patience with the speaker as negotiations faltered. In an Oval Office meeting last week, he told Mr. Boehner that if the sides didn't reach agreement, he would use his inaugural address and his State of the Union speech to tell the country the Republicans were at fault."
Hot for Teacher..
