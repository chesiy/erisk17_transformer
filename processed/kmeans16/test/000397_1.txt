Thanks!  :)
I started with similar stats. F24/5'5"/165 lbs. Now I am at 148. I've been logging calories on my fitness pal for 87 days. Haven't worked out much. I play pick up volleyball at the local school once a week. And try to go on walks, but haven't done any serious workout routines. I eat between 1200 and 1300 calories a day. Definitely track calories. It's the only way to lose.
I'm 5'5 and currently 151. We got this! :)
Romaine hearts :)
I'm glad you still enjoy it sometimes :)
We used ground beef prime rib burger, cooked it, added onion, and mixed in some canned enchilada sauce. And seasoned it with whatever my SO threw in there, he is the spice man.   I mixed corn, black beans, and canned tomato  green chilis together and heated them up.  This was meant to be just a side dish, but I threw some on top of my meat as well, and mixed a little bit of shredded Mexican cheese on top.   Calories came to 509. We aim to keep dinner between 500 and 600. Without the shell it would have been 444. And the meat we used wasn't lean, so probably could have shaved a bit more calories off if we picked a different meat. But I was still under calories for the day so I was happy with the meal :)   Edit: Numbers. ...
I love shells and bread and all the calorie dense carbs. I do enjoy a good taco salad, but I can't abandon my shells completely.  I ate all the lettuce boats first and saved the shell for last.
You're welcome! I really love the versatility of it. You can change it to your preferences quite a bit. :)
You're welcome!
Awesome! Thanks for the response. I'll probably crack one open later today anyways, just wanted to make sure there wasn't anything else I should look for.
Only reason I was looking for stainless steel instead of aluminum is because you can't cook acidic things in it.   For the actually canning process, there is no difference in what container you use then? As long as it covers the jars and you can heat it on the stove?  I'm in the process of getting a book :) I'm currently living somewhere with extremely limited resources, so I've been relying on friends, family, and internet advice.   I've been told to start with something easy the first time I can, does it really matter seeing as how I'll still have to go through the same canning steps? My plan is to make apple butter this week and can that as my first item.  Thanks again for all your help!
None!?
I bought some new soap and it definitely made a difference. I don't quite have the lather down. There are a couple areas that I'm having trouble getting a close shave with though. I still haven't cut myself yet, but I'm terrified of the day I do.
Do you still need six and seven?
Thank you for sharing what you went through. It's nice to know others have gone through the same thing.   I've started searching for a good psychiatrist near me.   Funny you should mention reading. Growing up I'd escape inside a book daily, but with school and work I haven't found time lately. Well last night I pushed everything aside and read just a few chapters of a non school related book. I've missed that.
Used this recipe http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/emeril-lagasse/vanilla-bean-creme-brulee-recipe/index.html and used an entire vanilla bean instead of only half. Struggled with the blowtorch part a bit though, in the pic you can see some of the sugar wasn't completely caramelized, but on other ones I ended up burning it. Any suggestions?
