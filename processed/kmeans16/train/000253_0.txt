Thanks :)
That's great :)
I am a CSS noob and could really use some help on my subreddit: /r/TheLunchLadyCalled   My subreddit is  /r/TheLunchLadyCalled  There are a bit of things i'd like to fix:  1. The name of the sub to appear on the header, without it being an uploaded picture  2. The text in the red and purple submit boxes to be aligned in the middle  3. The "mail icon" to stop being a green box and actually be a mail icon   Thanks so much, and I appreciate any help.
Thanks for the article.
[Just please take a quick look at this... especially Index 5... this website holds deep knowledge, not just mess.](http://www.973-eht-namuh-973.com/coloured%20site/start/evokation/indices.htm)
Does anyone know who this character is and from where?
/r/SpacePizzaDelight - a cool subreddit for pizza in space and other foods. The CSS is cool.

I don't know... I wonder that too
I'll be honest... I figured it out, though I doubt I'm the enlightened one. I kept it to myself, but someone else also figured it out and posted it.
