Wow thanks!!
I posted this answer in another Ask Reddit thread, so here it is:  I'm 5 years older than my younger sister, and when she was born I could never really grasp the concept that she had severe mental retardation. My parents always said she was "special", but I was too young to understand. I grew up loving and caring for her and I doted on her. She was too mentally retarded to walk or talk, and only communicated by pulling hair.   Fast forward and at this point I'm now a middle schooler who is ashamed and embarrassed of her own sister. I refuse to let my friends come over and rarely ever talk about my sister even though she was the light of my life, I cared more about fitting in. I constantly used the word "retarded" even though it made me uncomfortable knowing thats what people would call my sister.   One day, the first time I brought a friend to my house to hang out, they saw my sister and called her a "disgusting retarded freak" and she started to cry. I was distraught at seeing her cry and being FULLY AWARE of peoples opinions and what they said about her. I kicked my friend out and hugged my sister for a full hour.   After that, I realized that my sister isn't something to be ashamed of. She's my best friend, and to this day she will always be the love and light of my life.
I'm trying to pursue teaching abroad in Asia, and most programs require TESOL as well as a basic elementary English degree. I (currently) have no plans on teaching in the states for a long time.
Basically, my dad went out of the country (San Miguel de Allende, Mexico to Bostom, MA) for college and he HATED it. He doesn't want me to feel isolated and alone in a different state. Him not paying 50% for out of state tuition is a way to try to get me to stay in state, which I have always been adamantly protesting since my sophomore year...   I have visited MSU and I genuinely like the relaxed feel the student body has. I feel that itd would be much easier for me to graduate near the top of my class with amazing grades. But on the other hand, UNC is more prestigious but I feel as if my grades wont be up to standard.
God this is my dream room
Kinder surprise eggs!
I had my nose pierced about 4 months ago, and up until yesterday my nose had been healing fine. Yesterday I woke up from a nap and saw that my nose was HUGE and tender to the touch. I applied ice for about 15 minutes every hour or so. I applied Tea tree oil at night and when I woke up my nose was only a little better... Now the stud is sinking into my skin and I don't know what caused this. I don't think its an infection because I don't have any secretions or crustiness. Its just really red, swollen and hot to the touch. Should I still apply ice and tea tree oil to help soothe my piercing?   Advice is VERY welcome!!

I think I love you.
I would have loved to have someone sketch me/my character normally! But the staff members of this con said it was borderline hentai and my 8th grade mind was blown
Haha nah I'm in North Carolina!
I always cosplay as Taiga Aisaka from Todadora! because I'm around her size. One day at a local convention, this really creepy guy dressed as the joker was following me and my friend (dressed as Korra) around to every single pannel we went to. We weren't too creeped out because it was a very small convention, but it got to be weird when he started sketching things on a sketchpad... He would sit directly behind us and keep sketching. Eventually things got so uncomfortable that we told the convention staff about the man who was following us... Needless to say, they didnt want to show us the drawings he did. And I REALLY dont want to find out either.   EDIT: since people are wondering what my cosplay looks like, [here] (http://i.imgur.com/LJukuk2.jpg) ya go
(srs) but its still around?! I thought it was just a 2010 thing... This post made me look up AT and I found out they're still making episodes and now I'm like :o
Thanks for your opinion! Maybe of you would have read my previous comments you would have seen that it was one of my first attempts at a makeup. I appreciate your criticism but this is MY character, and I will represent them how I please. Plus, its creative. Sure, you may not like it, but its just a makeup for Valentines day. Seriously, I did it for fun, not for a movie. And by the way, you sound pretentious and off putting for commenting TWICE about how you dont like it. I get it. Now go away.

My Valentine's Day look: love leaves scars, love is blindness
They live in Kyoto, but its a host grandmother who is fairly old, and a host dad. I love them to death but they're not exactly in the loop with stuff hahaha.   That would be AMAZING if we could work something out! I'll send back some Cheerwine, which is North Carolinas specialty drink, if youre interested!
Wow I wish I looked like you when I was 14! I was rocking the raccoon eyeliner and concealer as foundation look... I think a nice bold winged liner could really draw attention to your eyes. Also, if youre a beginner with eye shadow, just find a nice pink shade that looks feminine (not hot pink or anything hahah) and dab that on the lid for a "fresh" look, then apply winged liner. Its good for someone your age and not too over-the-top!
Wow! Thanks! It actually was very helpful, this was what I was thinking of :)
Eyebrow game STRONG part 2
Army strong
I'm not sure its a joke... She was pretty instagram famous (~4k followers) but half of then were haters telling her that her brows looked terrible. So now she's going "all natural" and combing her brow hairs upwards so they look all furry. I dont think she understands that her new trend isn't helping her...
I'm LOVING my asymmetrical haircut!
A few weeks ago I received CC that I should try to fill in my brows more and to try out a more "dewy" look. I took the advice, so what do you think?  Products used  Primer: TwoFaced Primed and Poreless  Concealer: IT Cosmetics Bye-Bye Undereye  Foundation: IT Cosmetics Celebration Foundation  Lips: Vaseline   Eyeliner: NYX liquid liner  Eyebrows: Anastasia Beverly Hills Dipbrow Pomade  Highlighting: Sally Hansen Natural Beauty Highlighter Duo
Wow that color looks so good on you! My only recommendation is to make sure to either line your lips with pink liner or to use a concealed pen to outline your lips so the lipstick doesn't run, because its really noticeable when bright colored lipstick is getting a bit messy
IT is well worth the price! Honestly it covers so well I dont need concealer, but you have to buff well so the foundation doesn't appear cakey.  And about Coldstone, its just the way they're run, but mine doesn't require you to sing unless someone asks :P we're lazy!   I cant believe youre a cosplayer, its do rare to find them!!! I've done Taiga Aisaka from Toradora! Yin from Darker than Black, Harley Quinn, and im working on a Poison Ivy now that I got my awesome green lipstick from Melt Cosmetics 3
What Urban Decay eyeshadow palette is your favorite and why?   For Christmas I'm asking for an Urban Decay eyeshadow palette. I've had my eyes on Vice3 for a looooong time, but I'm not sure sure its worth it. So MU addicts.... Whats your favorite and why?
Is Urban Decays "Vice" palette worth the buy?
Kyoto, Japan
Yeah I brushed it off initially because it was at Kinkaku-ji temple, and if you look it up you will see it is visually striking. So I thought to myself "ah, I'm standing in a good area, he just wants good pictures like me!" I was very very wrong.
