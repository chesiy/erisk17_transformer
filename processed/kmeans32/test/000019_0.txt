You don't do that! 'The pass of Death' is frowned upon where I'm from.
Gibraltar back to back Word War Champs too!! It's funny trust me, look Gibraltar up.
I'm not religious but I like this man. Finally some one who actually seems to be in touch with the real world instead of the make believe one we have created for ourselves.   Edit: Any reason why I've been downvoted fro saying I like him other than you guys being assholes?. Didn't think so.
....Well, fuck. I've got/do about 80% of those things. Is it something that could get worse or develop with time? Cause these past few years I've just been getting increasingly socially awkward etc. Sorry for asking so many questions but I think I may be onto something here.
Ok fine it's not the worst one made, yes I was being a touch dramatic but it was just really infuriating because it felt like a step backwards instead of forward. Now though since it wasn't included in the last game they are more likely to not have the option again in this game. Match customization was a big part of the game for my friends and I so I apologise but I fell quite strongly since the WWE games have been a part of my life since forever.
He's not saying it doesn't take time and effort to build. He's saying it seems cheap and I agree. It's like bringing a gun to a knife fight, it's so over powered compared to all the other battle bots weaponry. It should be made illegal or like I mentioned further up the thread regulated so the props can only be of a certain length therefore removing these helicopter like monstrosities.
Snowbombing - Need some tips for next years trip!
The day someone actually makes a fully functional one of these things I'll be impressed, till then please don't waste our time and crush our hopes.
Nope, so far it seems non existent. Still have a few treasure quests to do so who knows! If I remember I'll post an update if I find anything.
Just because something looks like it may be a threat does not give the officer the right to murder a civilian. The police have to completely change their manner of conduct to keep in par with the military style of policing that they seem to love so much. Before a single shot is fired you must confirm that the "enemy" is armed and dangerous. A good way of doing this would be making an officer confirm with his partner before opening fire. Instead of just thinking he's a gun totting bad ass sheriff saving the town.
Buy the time I have to buy my next console you would have spent the same amount on parts on your PC. PC gamers are constantly swapping out parts because the next game they play requires a better graphics card or more RAM etc etc. Don't get me wrong I have nothing against PC gaming, I just don't like it when people argue that it is cheaper than a console because at the end of the day it really isn't. You could future proff your PC at fit in top of the range parts and then yes it would last a very long time without needing an upgrade but for that price (around 1500-2000) you could buy the next 3-4 generations of consoles.
...except a huge hole in my wallet where my money used to be.
Woah Woahh, I'm not having that type of language around here. It's called African American Forest Cake..And I'll see what I can do, it's not nigger season but maybe the supermarket will have some.
I came, I saw, I conquered.   This is my first time here in a few weeks. The only reason I came back was because of a random comment on a post I made in /r/gaming which only read but /r/button.    So I decided to click it and come to have a gander at how things are going. As soon as the page opened it was at around 20secs so I decided to unlock the button just in case.    Thanks /u/Jafas2000 you glorious bastard!
That's amazing work, Kudos!!
^N^^E^^^V^^^^E^^^^^R^^^^^^!
No but sometimes yes. You can play it without a problem but it does reference the history of the series a bit. Do as I did, play a bit and get a feel for what's going on in the current game and then go back and watch some youtube vids or read up a bit on it and you will get the full picture in no time.
Oh. Bulls. Nice
when his 200 Jeep Cherokee inexplicably went onto the shoulder and hit the trailer.   nbsp;  I'm guessing this was at around the same time he momenterily thought he was starring in an Action Movie.
Thanks man  that was a close one. We're even now.
Exactly this, she just seems like the typical "weak in character" teenager who can't or doesn't know how to say no. Fuck that bitch, get a real woman.
~~Seriously, who writes these online articles? They aren't that long so a proof read must be quite easy to do yet this kind of shit always happens.~~   nbsp;  ~~**Guy** is being praised as a hero.~~  ~~"I'm overwhelmed," **she** said. "I'm just a pizza deliverer, that's all."~~   I just realised her name is Guy, my bad Reddit. Carry on, nothing to see here.
although I agree with the notion of letting people do what they wany the whole don't pre order "campaign" on Reddit atm is to try and get people opinions to change, it's not an order but a suggestion. If we keep pre-ordering and companies realise this all they will do is cram amazing trailers and rumours down our throats in order to get all our pre-orders then they really don't have to do much more. They can produce a mediocre game and still make bank.
The kid walking away crying to the right is my favourite, he's like "fuck this shit, I'm out!!"   Edit: Or the one that's just realised what's happening and is "noping" the hell outta there pronto. I can't decide!
Strangely enough though I really want to "catch" them all.......^p^o^k^e^m^o^n
OOOhhhh fair enough and wow, I'm getting downvoted because I didn't know a racist swear word. Stay Awesome Reddit.
I wish I would've done this. I started on hard straight away, worst decision ever. Ended up having to train my guy by running around and killing a few walkers before being able to complete any missions. But then again it does make it a lot more fun in the survival sense having to learn from your mistakes etc.
I was directed here from the /r/button page   I've been told of an app that can warn me about the button running down?? I still have my click and I don't want to use it until it's really necessary.
I called the Dentist office today..   ..I asked the receptionist what appointments were available   She said "2:30"   I replied "thats why I'm calling."
TIFU by not taking the NSFW seriously..   ..Staring aimlessly at reddit and clicking every link on the page as one does on a Friday when there is not much work to do when all of a sudden I catch myself staring at a pair of immaculate busty titties. You are probably thinking to yourself "and how is that a fuck up? you've just seen titties"...well unfortunately for me the only woman who works in the office (who also happens to be my manager) was standing within eye shot (trying out a new phrase there). Needless to say she wasn't amused, I have to go see her at the end of the day. Not the best way to start off your weekend :(  TDLR; got caught looking at NSFW posts at work by manager who is the only woman in the office...i think I'm screwed   these are the titties in question, please do not open at work...learn from my mistake!!..   update: link got removed due to violations update: I thank America for inventing the 3 strike system. I still have a job but a strike against me and a manager who thinks im a perv...got off lightly tbh :)
If you are British you know "Tis the Season" when...
I'm Bored...AMA   at work, bored...so feel free to ask me anything about something or other and I shall do my best to reply with a completely unrelated topic.  Edit: Well that was an amazing 15 min. i didn't expect this to blow up as much as it did. the minutes have literally flown by!! thanks for all the support and if you missed me this time round do not worry....i get bored A LOT..
