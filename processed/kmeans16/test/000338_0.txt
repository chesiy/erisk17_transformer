I was also a big fan of both trailers, but you're right - I liked SS more.  I like the direction the DCCU is going, and I hope they are successful!
Review: Pixars Inside Out Beautifully Depicts the Emotion and Struggle of Growing Up (x-post, /r/movies)
This is very interesting.  Now, I know that man people who frequent this sub were tired of Shaw, and wanted him out, so I can understand the elation that I am seeing everywhere, but I'd like to draw attention to how strange this is (in my opinion at least).  It is pretty clear that this team in in tanking mode.  If they end up with more than 25 wins this year, it will be a mistake (fortunately, we are well on track for the #5 slot in the lottery, which gives us a good puncher's chance at top 3 (almost 30%, with 9% chance at #1 overall).  That being said - why not just let Shaw carry out the rest of the year?  What is to be gained from having an interim coach for the last month and a half?  The only conclusion that I can come to is that the front office thinks that the longer Shaw stays around, the more damage he does to the players we have.  They want him out ASAP so that he doesn't frustrate Lawson (for example), or so that he doesn't keep wasting opportunities to get rookies minutes, or so he doesn't poison the culture beyond repair.  Anyway, it just strikes me as a horribly negative view on Shaw as a locker-room presence.  It may be justified, but that doesn't make it any less surprising for me.
Lotsa people arguing about looks and pretty and girl next door and what not.  But when she sings, "Two bottle of whiskey for the way.  And I sure would like some sweet company, and I'm leaving tomorrow, what'd'ya say?" I have only one question:  What.  Fucking. Train?
People are just pissed that everyone but Ripley dies at the very beginning.  Couple that with the well-documented studio tampering and tinkering with Fincher, and you get an under-performing movie that everyone remembers as way worse than it is.  But, you're right, it is just fine.  I'll tell you what - if *Terminator: WeCan'tSpell*, *Star Wars: The Force*, and *Jurassic The Lost World Park World* are half of what Alien 3 was, then the 2015 blockbuster season will have over-performed.
This is one of those crazy coincidences that makes life so cool!  I was thinking about this exact problem for the last few days, but it was on a much more abstract level as I am not trained as a computer scientist.  As a Bitcoin enthusiast, though, I was focusing on utilization blockchain-like technology to get it done, so I am excited to read your stuff.  I am going to enjoy reading this thoroughly; thanks for the full text!  It isn't easy completing an advanced degree (March '14 for me).  Have a beer on me as a congratulations! /u/changetip
YES!  I was not going to respond to my own post (obv).  Glad to see a civilized redditor.  Also, love your mustard bronco guy.
Totally right.  Football in the new era is getting to the dance,  then playing your best 3-4 games there.  If we play like the SF, SD, or IND games in the playoffs, we have a good chance.   If we play the SEA or NYJ games, not so much.  It is true for every other team in the league, too.  But I think that the Broncos have a greater margin for error than almost every other team, and that feels good (for example, both the D and O can carry us if one falters).  GG.  Fuck the Raiders.
Yeah, me too.
I like that all three of your triple-posts have a different amount of down votes.
It isn't nearly as bad as folk are making out.  There was a tug on T.Y.'s jersey that sent him to the floor as an interception happened, and then another tug to Shady ' s jersey that was knee - jerk ed as a whorescollar but wasn't.  Two fairly innocuous mistakes (but still mistakes).  But it wasn't any Superbowl 40 or Replacement refs Hail Mary touchdown.
Wow, you're a great human being.
I think it is very reasonable to pick up Bubba (I am yelling in my wife's ear to grab him for her last bench slot right now).  Remember last year when Welker was out with his concussion and Bubba was the best player in the Thursday night loss vs. San Diego?  No reason that kind of thing can't happen again.    You'd need a pretty deep league (12+ players, and at least 1 flex, maybe two) to give him a serious start those first four weeks, but in later rounds it is hard to see that much upside.
I don't think that's right . . .
I think he means the weird-looking bespectacled dude with the long straight hair who always gets mustard or soda spilled all over his nice suit, often by J.P. (JG-L's buddy).
1.  The virus is generally thought to stay in the neuron where it is latent, but a smoldering cell to cell infection is also possible in the ganglia  2.  Auto-innoculation is definitely possible and happens often.  3. It is possible, but there is not much known about genital - oral transmission rates.  Suffice to say it is likely nonzero, though.  4.  HSV and VZV belong to the alphaherpesviruses.  I think what you are looking for, though, is "neurotropic".
