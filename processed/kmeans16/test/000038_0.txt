That's also true!
BUT WE HAVE KOBE AND CLARKSON! Guess who hasn't been winning with that backcourt (I know Kobe's been injured), Kobe's got limited time left in the league, and who better to mentor our new young guard. Hopefully we pickup a free agent big to provide a decent season, plus Okafor is basically Brook Lopez without the jumpshot range, good but won't take you to the next level, In Mitch We Trust.
THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU FUCKING SAY SO

I was talking about the fact that Iron Man 3 is his worst movie
Oh no, we're getting into to the hate circlejerk for a popular movie, not saying you're circlejerking though, however this is the post that will lead to "Am I the only who hated Mad Max Fury Road?" And then "Why Mad Max gave me HIV"
Something to be considered   We've made quite a few moves improving our defense this off season, which is great, but the only problem is last year, while defense was a major concern, our offense was pretty abysmal. Obviously the team isn't going to be perfected in one off season, plus McCloughan still needs time to gather talent, but barring a breakout from RG3 (please!) were not going very far (which is expected already).
Lol......I don't get it  Edit: Fuck maybe I should read the title next time I'm in a thread
A top 10 play gone just like that, fuck you Cox
Yeahhhh if you could chuck a deep pass to Crabtree for a TD that'd be greatttt.
oh I know its not, let me dream man.
While I do think this is well done, it's just another poster of someone looking away at something. Too many of those
