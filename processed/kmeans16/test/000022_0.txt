It's from a lamb's leg
We do here in the Netherlands. The overall quality is better in Germany though
Preparing for homemade dner kebap this weekend

Enjoying a nice day at the beach, when suddenly...
Well thanks :)
Douche means shower in Dutch
No problem
How do I do that? Can I just zip the save file and upload it somewhere?
Initially, the hour glass shape was the mob farm, but it didn't work because it was too low (monsters would spawn in the caves below, not in the farm) so I made another mob farm on top of it, the upper most part is the chamber where they spawn, with 4 8-long and 2-wide canals that lead to the hole in the middle. And yes, sorry, everything was done with vanilla minecraft.  EDIT: Monsters spawn within a range of 144x144 according to the video I watched, but they only move when you're in range (about 32 blocks). Yet if you are to close, they don't spawn, I think they spawn when you're 24 blocks away. So I made sure that the floor of the dark room on top was 30 blocks above the floor where you can kill the mobs. Because it is so high up (the collecting floor is 72+ above the ground, to prevent monsters from spawning below) and I put torches on the ceiling and the collecting floor, they are forced to spawn in the room.   In the room, there are 4 canals leading to the hole in the middle, which are 2 blocks deep, in order to prevent the mobs to escape. At the bottom of the tunnel, i put slabs in order to kill the monster and prevent spiders from escaping.   This is the video which helped me a lot: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liYHNsXTcBc
I though radioactive meant beautiful
We got kampers in the netherlands, which is pretty much the same as White trash in the states. For a very funny, over the top illustration of their behaviour watch New Kids nitro http://m.imdb.com/title/tt2043932/ Or turbo: http://m.imdb.com/title/tt2043932/ i hope there's a version with english subtitles, but both movies are definitely a good laugh
Skyline is such a bad movie, it's not even fun to watch when you are watching bad movies on purpose
yo dawg...
Awesome interactive art project for kids
