Fyi, asexual =/= no libido. Just say no libido. But you're right, the sudden drop is somewhat abnormal and talking to a gyno would probably be a good idea. Depending on where you live you might not need parental approval for an appointment - some states in the U.S. allow you to go doctors at 16 without parental permission. You can always call a local gyno and ask if you need permission from your mom to make an appointment. If not, then you're golden. If you do, you might be able to at least just talk to one over the phone about your problem.
I have PTSD from childhood abuse, and I know how badly it can fuck up your life. It really sounds like you need to talk to your therapist about all this stuff, but if you feel like regular sessions aren't enough you can also reach out in other ways for help.   There are lots of crisis hotlines, support groups, etc. for victims of sexual violence, as well as people with PTSD. You should look online for local organizations like that. A good support group can be a great supplement to individual therapy. It really helps to know you aren't the only one going through something like that.   Also, you mentioned that you and your boyfriend broke up because of your emotional changes and behavior after the trauma. I know you feel like you screwed up that relationship forever, but if you never told him what happened to you then obviously he wouldn't understand what's going on. It can be ready hard to confide in someone about traumatic events, but it might do you some good to come clean to him. Even if you don't get back together, it might help you both get some mutual understanding about what was happening. I'm sure he noticed something wasn't right, and if he knew the reason why you suddenly changed he would probably be more willing to let go of all that.  Another serious thing you should consider is how you're self-medicating with alcohol. I'm sure you don't need me to tell you this is bad. It's tempting to try to drink until you forget, but trust me, this doesn't work. You need to find healthier ways to deal with this stuff. Maybe consider going to AA to help deal with this problem.   Finally, I just want you to know that what happened to you wasn't your fault and your reaction is totally normal. You didn't deserve to be assaulted, and everything you described - from the way you reacted when it was happening to the turmoil it left you in up until now - is actually super common for people who go through stuff like this. I sincerely hope you can learn to love yourself and open up to others again and that you get the help you need. If you want, feel free to PM me to talk about whatever.
That's good. Even if someone shouldn't associate with a friend, family member, or partner anymore trying to push them into it can just make things worse. They might stubbornly refuse just because they don't want to feel like they were forced into it, or out might stress them out if they aren't ready.   Also I should probably clarify that I wasn't trying to get down in you or anything, it's just a really serious topic so I felt like I should give some weight to it.   There most likely will be a tough transition period right after your boyfriend moves out. People like his dad tend not to respect boundaries and can really freak out whenever you start enforcing them. So be ready for that. But ultimately moving out will probably make him feel a lot better so there's still something to look forward to!  All that aside, your boyfriend is lucky to have you to support him through this and I hope you guys make it through okay. Give him my well-wishes and all the best to both of you!
I haven't finished it yet, but I'm really enjoying it so far. I don't know if I'd say it's a better game overall than Origins, but it's definitely a much better follow up than 2 was.  Some aspects that have definitely improved are the romance options and diversity of characters. I'm really glad that there are more options for people to romance (characters that are straight, gay, bi, pan), more options for race (playing as a Qunari is awesome!), and they even included a trans character that is actually treated respectfully! It's a big step forward in gaming when AAA titles in huge franchises are so inclusive.
Thank you! I'm glad I'm not the only one who sees that as a reasonable decision. And no, I certainly would not invite him for my mom's sake. Don't worry, I'm standing firm in that one.   As far as where she was? I know she's seen more than a few of the bad incidents between us so that's part of why I'm so at a loss as to why she doesn't get it. The only thing I can think is that she just somehow doesn't realize HOW BAD it is. That's why I asked her to read up on PTSD.
Thanks! I appreciate it :)
It's ok to be confused about your sexual identity, especially as you're growing up and you haven't been exposed to a lot of options living in an area with little lgbt presence. To me it seems like you're a girl who enjoys crossdressing (although I wouldn't rule out the possibility of being genderfluid or otherwise non-binary), and you are emotionally attracted to people regardless of their gender, making you panromantic. You could also be somewhere on the asexual spectrum. I would take a look around /r/asexuality.   Of course, it's up to you to decide what your identity is and what labels do or don't fit you. But don't stress it - sexuality is complex and fluid, and it's possible as you become more sexually experienced you'll change your mind. That's perfectly ok and normal. And it's also ok and normal to not know for sure sometimes. What's important is that you do what feels best for you.
I kinda wish they hadn't gone that route, though. You still got some of it in the books, but it seems like the show is placing a lot more emphasis on "Shae betrays Tyrion out of jealousy." In the books, though, I like to think it was all about money from the get-go. Like the scene with Littlefinger talking about how a good whore will make a man think that she is enjoying herself despite her expectations, I feel like book-Shae was just making Tyrion think that she fell in love with him despite herself but wanted his money and status the whole time.  Also, I think that this motivation is more in line with Tyrion's motivation; its basically the inverse of his first marriage. It makes his rage a lot more justifiable if he wasn't merely betrayed, but felt like he was lied to from the beginning. Finding out that Shae betrayed him out of jealousy would put at least some of the blame on him for not properly maintaining their relationship - it was a problem he could have potentially amended. But if she never loved him to begin with, it is yet another example of how the universe has fucked him over and he never had a chance because he's a dwarf. And that seems to be the recurring theme with all of his issues - I can't get anyone to love me because all they see is a dwarf.
I actually really like Sherlock and Light, though. I think part of the problem might be because women are often portrayed as overly emotional and way too needy, not to mention that women are often more likely to be diagnosed with various mental disorders, and the yandere subtype tends to feed into those negative stereotypes and perceptions. So seeing a character like Yuno that's just outright psychotic gives me a sort of icky feeling. She does, however, fit in really well with the tone of the series, so while I don't personally like her I do see why she was important to the plot.
Wow, that's so awesome! I'm glad that everyone at your work seems to be cool with it all, and that your mom is supporting you too! I hope things go well with your life from now on, and good luck! :
In my experience, triggers aren't that predictable. You never really know when it will happen, and it might never go away. I haven't lived with my abuser for almost four years now and I still get anxiety attacks occasionally.  However, talking to a therapist and other survivors about it has helped me gain perspective and practice coping mechanisms for it. So even though the triggers haven't gone away, they don't affect me quite as badly because now I handle them a lot better. So there's that.  As far as moving on, you aren't "supposed" to do anything. You don't just "get over" abuse - it stays with you pretty much forever. But it usually starts to affect you less and less, gradually over time. Just take things at your own pace and do what's healthy for you. Talk to a therapist or abuse counselor if you aren't already. Do things a day at a time. Eventually it will get better.
That is a really tough issue. In my current relationship everything works out because I'm not totally opposed to sex, and we're also poly so my partner is free to have sex with someone else if he wants. But we aren't married and don't have any kids, so I can't give you any perspective there.  What I can tell you is that you shouldn't feel horrible or that you're a freak. You can't help wanting to have sex with your wife - you're a sexual person, and I'm sure you love her very much. However, speaking from an asexual perspective, I probably understand your wife's situation better than I do yours. I sometimes feel guilty about the fact that my SO and I aren't entirely sexually compatible. I know that he wants to please me and share physical contact with me; that is a core part of a relationship for most people. Whenever we are intimate, I can tell that he wishes he could do more for me, but I'm just not that into sex. And then I feel bad because he feels bad, even though it's neither of our faults.  I think that's a key point here - this isn't anyone's fault. You can't help having desires, and she can't help not having them. Both of you are perfectly normal in this. But it is causing friction in your marriage, so it does have to be dealt with. If you've been married long enough that you have more than one child I assume you've probably been through a lot together, and you love each other and want to make each other happy. Start from there. Have a conversation about this with your wife. Remember that no one is the guilty party here, and have a frank discussion about your feelings. Be honest with each other. Once you figure out what each person wants and needs, you can work together to form a strategy to fix the issues you're having. This doesn't have to be a huge issue in your relationship, but it will only get worse if you don't communicate about it.
Um ... yes, it is.
I made this using a 16" pillow form and some worsted weight yarn. For the body of the pillow I just crocheted a circle and made increases and decreases as necessary to fit the pillow shape. For the legs, arms, and head I free-handed all of it. It's super soft and comfy, and I got a yarn that's machine washable and dryable so it's pretty kid-friendly too. If you guys have any questions I'd love to answer them!  Edit: Wow! So many people want patterns. Okay, I will definitely be writing that out later tonight or tomorrow, whenever I have time. I'll probably charge for the pattern, though - does $5 sound fair?
Nope, not overreacting at all. If a guy did that to me I'd be pissed. This dude sounds like a class-A douche. Slut-shaming, anti-abortion, yet he thinks it's totally okay to have sex with you while not using protection, cum inside you anyway knowing that you're not using any form of birth control, and laughs at you for being upset? I don't know why you were every with this guy in the first place, to be honest.  I would seriously advise you to cut this guy out of your life. Clearly he doesn't respect your body, your consent, or women in general. NOT boyfriend material, at least imho.
Seriously, I don't understand you. All I wanted to do was talk about something I like with other people who like it too. Instead, I get an outcry about why I don't belong here because I haven't finished the books *even though the rules of the subreddit state this is perfectly okay.* When people try to tell me that I might get spoiled I respond by saying it shouldn't be an issue as long as everyone follows the rules, and that I'll take my chances because I came here to have fun and participate in discussion.  So instead of letting it go, you insist that I'm a dick for wanting to be here and now you're going to do the EXACT THING that you and everyone else has been warning me about? Self-fulfilling prophecy much? But apparently I'm still the dick. Whatever dude, seems like you're the one with the problem here, not me - I've had plenty of good discussion and pleasant exchanges with other people on this thread and in this sub in general. Right now you're the only one who is acting like a stubborn dick, really.
