You have such a way with words.
Thanks, I've been reading online about some of the side effects but hadn't anticipated them coming this quickly. I've got another appointment with my doctor in a fortnight so if it's not starting to ease then I'll go over my options.
Not sure about official definitions but this is how I define them:  Fancy dress - generic costume e.g. wolf, mermaid, witch,  Cosplay - dressing in costume as an established character e.g. Teen Wolf, Ariel, Wicked Witch of the West
I've never been self employed though :-S in 2012 I worked in a call centre and in 2013 worked for a soft furnishings company. I never received a final P45 from the call centre (they were a front for a timeshare company so I'm assuming they didn't file the documentation properly) and the soft furnishings company evidently didn't have me on the right tax code; I'm currently paying back that debt.  HMRC have the details for my current employer as I contacted them when I started last year, so I don't need to fill in tax returns now.   Edit: To clarify I worked for the call centre Jan - July and Aug - Nov 2011 (was paid off both times) and I worked for the soft furnishings company from Feb 2012 - Feb 2013 (company went into liquidation)
I'm seeing a lot of comments urging users to switch to Voat in response to the decisions of Reddit upper management.  Can you give me an ELI5 breakdown of Voat?
You've written in all caps so it *must* be true.
As a fellow bride with a strained relationship with my father - he won't even be coming to the wedding - I can see where your concern is coming from and massive Internet hugs to you.  Would a possible compromise be, as someone else suggested I'm sure, having your DJ play a song dedicated to your FH and FMIL but have the dance floor open to everyone? This would allow them to have their dance to a song of their choosing without the implications of a spotlight dance.
UK here, we're hoping to have a humanist celebrant marry us. We have to become a member of the humanist society for 2 years prior to the wedding  (they offer a package for engaged couples). Humanist ceremonies are much more personal than a traditional registrar and as FH and I are both atheists and marrying in an observatory it felt fitting.  [Here's a link to their website](http://www.humanism-scotland.org.uk)
A glorious piece of modern art featuring liquid shit in the toilet bowl, vomit on the floor and period blood smeared on the wall. The tampon belonging to said blood was lying on top of the sanitary bin.

All cats were female and all dogs were male.
Not had it with pineapple but I can heartily recommend cheese and apple toast. That stuff is amazing.
Star wars.
Get ready for school. I was 5.
Chose his girlfriend over me.
Are you talking about the POP figures? Because looking at your link those are Fallout 3 figurines.   Am I missing something?
Omg yes! I'm currently at uni and have just started bringing my laptop in to take notes as it is too awkward to write anything by hand.
Not had slap on the ass but something similar. I work as a waitress/barmaid and this particular night was on the bar. The pub was quite quiet at this point so I was chatting to some punters. Bear in mind I'm 25 and these guys were easily in their late 40's.   So one of the guys asks to buy me a drink, I said no as I was working but if I saw him in the pub when I was off I'd remind him. I then promised "hand on heart" that this would happen, while placing my hand over my chest. He took this as an opportunity to lean over the bar and make a grab for my chest "just to check (I) even had a heart." I leapt back and laughed it off, told him he'd just have to take my word for it and went back to work. I told my manager later what had happened and he told me to let him know if anything like that happens again.
I almost drowned when I was 3/4 years old. Until then I loved swimming but it took 3 years for me to even get out of a kiddies pool after it and any attempt to take me for swimming lessons would result in me screaming the place down.  I've never properly learned how to swim, I can do basic strokes but not for long periods of time and can't tread water. I'm still wary in deep water, it freaks me out if I can't see the bottom.
The sound and feel of polystyrene rubbing together. It's the worst part of opening packaging.
I curl up under my covers, plug my earphones into my phone, stick on Spotify and shut out the world.
I second your opinion on Vivienne. On my first playthrough all I could think was "what a condescending, snobby cow." As such I missed a lot of her dialogue because I never took her with me.  After playing again and actually listening to her I realise just how hard she had to work to attain her position, and although her and my Quiz will never agree politically, I can still respect her opinion.
A bright yellow puffer jacket. I loved my gran but sometimes she picked the most horrendous gifts.
Most offensive, it starts out ok but then turns into a cacophony of hours.
I know, that's why I wasn't sure whether or not to message them again. I don't want them to feel pressurised, it's the delivery service who would be at fault. It's my first time receiving a gift from out of the country and I wasn't 100% sure what the average delivery times were either.  Thanks for advising me about the username issue, I didn't know if I could change it. It sounds sad but I didn't want to lose my trophy haha.
Game of thrones exchange...no gift yet.
Community.
How have I never noticed that?? I really need to hit up IMDB more often.
They're the worst, at least bees have a purpose. I actually passed that exam which was amazing considering the panic attack I had following Waspgate.

Aged 3/4 I was out at a pub with my family for Sunday lunch. A larger gentleman came in and proceeded to use the fruit machine. His size must have offended me as I immediately turned to my mum and yelled* "MUMMY HE'S FAT!"  My poor mother had to apologise to the man in question and I happily went back to devouring my meal.
