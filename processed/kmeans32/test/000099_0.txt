Or... Bow to the shoe, cat!
Somebody didn't make it.
Franklin?
I love Jimmy Fallon.
I hope his name is Yoda.
I couldn't imagine that. Drowning in the ocean would definitely be the worst.
Oh yea! Went to the store and fought some people for bread and got the last jug of milk. Don't know what I can make with the two but I'm ready.

You're welcome! It's awesome to see the number of people that are from or have passed through our area.

Yep sure is is!
That's awesome! I love living near mountains. I'm not sure if I'd want to live anywhere else. Just about everyday I see something that I haven't noticed before. I hate when they go bare as well. Way more beautiful in the summertime when everything is green.

You guys go into a dome shaped room where a computer sits in the middle of the room and you enter 6 numbers in a specific sequence. If you fail to enter the sequence in an alloted amount of time and hit return all of reddit will cease to exist. True or False?
It's a frog dog!
Ohio State was undefeated until.... yea, nevermind.. still hurts.

If we're sharing stories, back when I was an RA I got a call at 3am from my boss saying EMS was on their way and I needed to meet two students outside with them.  Long story short, the boyfriend was at the girlfriends dorm room and while they were getting it on the girlfriend passed out and the boyfriend panicked and called 911.  While we were standing outside with EMS the boyfriend asked the EMS worker if she passed out because he was putting it in her butt...
