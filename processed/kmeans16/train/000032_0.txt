The government shouldn't decide what you should or should not wear.   I'm getting more and more into Canadian politics and some popularly held views I come across are very strange for me, one of which being the whole niqab-while-taking-citizenship-oaths thing. I don't mean to be offensive but I just can't seem to understand the line of thinking behind the view.   Feedom of expression exists for the things we don't like, the ones we like don't need protection. I'm personally against any type of hijab but I realize that it's just not my call to make. It's their body and they should be able to decide what to wear. I just simply don't understand how people who say they stand for freedom want to ban certain types of clothing from some events.   Thanks!

**super alpha postnationalism FAQ**  -founded as a counter-jerk to the prevailing western attitude- against foreigners, against outsourcing, against immigrants, which i believe is mostly founded on a "fuck you got ours"   ie: "socialist" norway, 1 trillion $ oil fund, huge landmass, still no room for immigrants. australias white immigration policy, americas 10 year waiting lists etc.  -veganism says species:discrimination, we declare some species lower and then eat them. the same thing happens with our global caste system.  -labor is divided. the illegal immigrants are used as a bargaining chip to push down the wages for the local people, and the answer is NOT to join forces with your employer against the foreign labor  -US vs THEM mentality, ww3, hitler. nationalism leads to war over scarce resources. dehumanizing other nations peoples and demanding your nation is #1 etc.   **WHAT IS THE FUTURE OF POSTNATIONALISM?**  united globe, be it under global government or what. people can move freely around. indians and americans and africans are equal.

yea but the debate used to be about the usa being the beacons of liberty, democracy and human rights   now theyre just as bad as china..
One can show that every developed country was aware of the risk of harm from continued emissions, as early as 1992 and in a number of cases even earlier. And therefore have a moral obligation to help those who have least contributed to the problem, and are most vulnerable to the risks, to adapt to climate change.  Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame, With conquering limbs astride from land to land; Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.  "Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!" cries she With silent lips. "Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"  What I'm saying is that we are all going to need help. /r/postnationalist Were in this together.
Seriously? Your argument is that I'm mossad? Don't make me dig up that /r/askengineers thread where they debunk every point /u/lookingfortruths makes..   We both want to find the truth behind 9/11, I'm just a bit sticker on research apparently..
Dunno it seems to me like this forum has "shut our ears" a bit on the 9/11 issue. I see a ton of convincing evidence that a) only partial freefall and b) the towers collapsed from the fires   /r/askengineers had a ton of responses to all the 9/12 physics questions.. Too bad I am not qualified to judge who is right.   That said.. It was just too perfect. inside job!
hey that sounds kind of reasonable, fuck if i know
