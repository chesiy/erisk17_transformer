How the fuck did he get Bonzi Buddy? That thing's been extinct since like, the 2000's
Whenever I'm down or sad or feeling apathetic I just come to this sub and look at this one image. It always makes me feel better.

TIFU by not Checking my Ports.   Hey guys, so I just fucked up a few minutes ago, lemme explain.  It's 2 in the morning and i'm 16, I have my own room and laptop, it's a simple laptop, a chromebook, but it does what I need it to do. However, I'm also a heavy listener of music and as such have a nice pair of over the ear headphones. So i come into my room, I had just gotten back from using the bathroom after trying to fall asleep for the past four hours, but try as I might I can't sleep.  As I come back into my room I decide that sleep isn't happening so I instead opt to go to grab my computer and surf the web. I begin surfing and after a while I decide to put on some music, I check to make sure my headset is plugged in. Now, my headset has two plugs a USB and an audio/mic cable. I can feel that it's plugged into the USB port but the audio cable isn't plugged in so I quickly fix that, however my chromebook only has one input that works as either a mic port or an audio out port.  I plug in the audio cable, not really looking, and pull up [this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IwmYAdgU18) The song starts up and I notice it's a bit quiet, so I bump up the volume on my chromebook until it's at full volume, at this point it's listenable and I'm pleasantly rocking out. About 2 minutes later my dad bursts into the room, yelling at the top of his lungs about how he has work tomorrow and I need to turn that down immediately.  I'm confused for a moment before I look down and notice that... My mic cable was plugged in instead of my audio out cable. Since I had noise cancelling headphones I hadn't noticed them yelling at me to turn it off, and I hadn't noticed that it was so quiet even at max volume because I had those on...  TL;DR: Mix up mic input and audio output cables for my headset and end up blasting Rock music at full volume at 2:00 in the morning.

all martial arts, real and fictional fight in a battle to the death.   Every real martial art including all major styles fights along with all fictional martial arts. All martial arts gets the greatest ever practitioner of the art to represent them, if a martial art has it's practitioner be stronger than a normal human athlete (IE: Kenshiro or Goku), they will be scaled down to only be able to do what a olympic athlete human can do. Ki blasts are allowed but they can't be any stronger than a punch and take twice the effort of throwing that punch physically.  If a martial art involves the use of weapons as a requirement (Like kendo or fencing) they will be given a standard quality version of the weapon made of either metal or wood, however, martial arts which have weapons as optional (Like aikido) are not given weapons and are only allowed to use their fists.  No rules are enforced so hits to the groin and gouging of the eyes are perfectly fine.  The arena is a large, flat stadium with more than enough room for all competitors.  Round 1: All real martial arts in a team VS all fictional martial arts in a team.  Round 2: Free for all, all martial arts against each other, alliances can be formed but only one can stand at the end.  Round 3: free for all in which fictional martial arts are no longer allowed to use any form of ki/energy attacks.  Round 4: All competitors are given SMG's, Automatic shotguns, and chainsaws, which art lasts the longest.

No one knows. it could be HL3. it could be bread*.  *Most likely bread.
What the sidebar was talking about was how many parts of our culture talk about satanism in a way that makes people think it's all about sacrificing virgins and eating animals hearts. You can see this is the way satanism is presented by many media outlets who just want to make a quick buck and sensationalize our faith. hence the "hollywood style depictions" line.  The message wasn't you shouldn't be allowed to but rather that's not what most sects are all about. If that's what you as an individual do as a way to express yourself then I'm not going to stop you for the express reason of "That's not what satanism is about." Though I am ideologically opposed to sacrifice myself because of moral reason's. I'm not going to stop you.  TL;DR It's not saying you can't. It's saying that the sensationalized hollywood version of satanism isn't what every satanist is about.
Honestly as a member for almost a year now, I share your sentiment as do many other in the community. But by simply looking past the hateful shite on there you can find some useful information on there. Remember, don't follow anything blindly and think with your brain instead of your gut.
Yeah, petroleum or oil is the decayed remains of ancient megafauna/flora (giant animals/plant) So the moon having oil means there would have to have been life at one point which is (spoilers) Huge.
NCR. everyone else is just sitting on their asses barely surviving (Bar the enclave and BoS (most BoS chapters except the eastern one are jerks)) Not only that but factions like the followers or the leigon wouldn't even exist if not for them. And so far they're the only government consisting of more than one town that's democratic.

TIL that there was a man named Frank "Cannonball" Richards who often took a cannonball to the gut as a carnival act.
This sounds like a pretty good idea. And once fallout 4 is released and a large influx of new people start playing 3/NV then it could serve as some form of guide for beginners.  I might as well contribute a tip myself.  Whenever your going through the wasteland at early levels, always pick up any junk you see so long as it doesn't over encumber you. You can always sell it for some caps. Even seemingly worthless things like dinner plates can help you when your saving up for that new gun.
