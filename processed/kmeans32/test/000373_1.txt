If you could only use a single line from a song to talk for a day, which song and line would you choose?   You have to use the line to convey all emotions, ask/answer questions, and make general statements (think "I Am Groot").
Please don't, touch my penis.
I was still living at home at the age of 26 when I met my future wife (6 years now).  Parents said I could stay as long as I wanted to after high school and college, rent free. Ended up saving up a LOT of money doing that. I was able to pay off multiple cars over the years, built my credit up to a great number, and had a hefty savings for doing special things with my girl (including buying her the rings and wedding that she always wanted).  No ragrets.

What do you hate about one of your friends?

I'd say the birth of Jesus.  I'd sneak in and replace the 8 lbs, 6 oz Savior with the baby prop from American Sniper and see how long it takes the wise men to notice.

What would be your superhero name, if it had to do with the last food item you ate?
Kinda strange for her friends to protect the person she just punched, eh?
Yeah. No doubt.

What has changed about your body in the last five years?   Good or bad.
If you never had to sleep, what would you do while everyone else was snoozing?
Ok...he's never *seen* me see his trouser wonder, from down under.
That was an amazing answer. Now, I want a monkey.

He's in [this](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4362342/) now.  It's an interesting show, but once again he carries his co-host...IMO.
I find your choice of breakfast foods rather [shallow and pedantic](https://youtu.be/yetwdpsiM8Q).
Daryl?
I don't know if I should trust you with a brownie...but I am hungry.  Oh what the hell!  Why not?  What's the worse that could happen?

Tonight, I came close to telling a friend that I've cut myself before.   I'm going through a lot of shit right now (that I don't feel like divulging at the moment). I got a text from a friend asking if I wanted to join him for some drinks at a bar tonight. I said sure and a couple of hours in, we were having serious conversations about our lives.  I came really close to telling him about how the scar on my arm was from when I felt my life was in a tailspin and the pain from cutting was the only thing that I could actually control. As soon as I got ready to say it, I chickened out. I just couldn't imagine what one of my closest friends would think about me.  I don't cut anymore, but every time I sweat while playing basketball or working out...it becomes very visible. I guess that will be with me for the rest of my life.  There's no real point to this post. I just needed to get that out.

Have you ever traced your birthday back 9 months and thought about when/why were you conceived?   My birthday is early in September and I arrived late, so I think I was a Thanksgiving zygote.  Pass the stuffing.
I've read a version of that before somewhere and let me tell you...I fucking hate it!      Whenever my wife calls me from downstairs and I'm halfway down, that little thought pops into my head for some reason.  If I went towards her voice in the kitchen and then I heard her calling me from one of the upstairs rooms...I would probably shit myself right there.
How do you deal with emotional pain? You drop it like it's hot...
TIFU by getting pulled for speeding...twice...   ...within a ten minute window.  First one was 70 in a 45 on a highway. Got a ticket for that. In the same stop, I got a written warning about my expired tag and a verbal warning about my tinted windows. Gave him a "Thank you sir." and I was on my way home.  Second one was 83 in a 60 on the interstate. Got a verbal warning for that. Here's the kick...I also got a ticket for my expired tag and one for my tinted windows. I was contemplating on saying "Thank you sir, may I have another?", but I realized that would not end well for me.  Needless to say, my driving habits will be changing...along with my insurance premiums.
It is a very nice product, but that one overturned penny would make me want to set it on fire and send that heterogeneous piece of art straight to table HELL!
Cut the head off...
One tip was the bike glitch thing...which I'm a little weary of doing. I don't want to get banned from playing online or anything over a stupid glitch. Is that possible?  Another was a single player tip to invest in the companies that Lester talks about before doing the assassinations...which I haven't done any of them yet.  And another was: 1. Make two character profiles. 2. Have one be like an "off shore" bank account. 3. Whatever money you earn with your main character, put into the bank. 4. Switch to the other character and have him withdraw it all into pocket cash. 5. Switch back to the main character, and if someone kills you, the "medical bill" doesn't get taken out of your bank account.
