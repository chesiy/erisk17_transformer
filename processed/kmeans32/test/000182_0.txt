Not really, if "nothing happens" and accused terrorists are tried and found guilty before "anything happens", these organizations would look just fine.  Problem is - the only organization with a meaningful record of "thwarted attacks" (the FBI) has constantly been exposed as deliberately entrapping people, re-contextualizing, relying on unreliable sources for false convictions, etc. Meanwhile, what we get from the NSA is massive domestic spying, international spying on allies, while the CIA is busy running black ops toppling democratically elected governments.  Calling for reform isn't an imposition of a catch-22.

Especially since the Iraq war gained us exactly nothing.  Not true. We got a shit ton of contracts for Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Haliburton, and various other firms that are part of the military industrial complex. We also created quite a few jobs. Not to mention we've led to that region becoming epically fucked and unstable - ergo -  more contracts for our private military companies.  And who knows, maybe 10 years down the road, a puppet government - hopefully less subservient to Iran and more to us - will be kind enough to allow our private civil corporations to rebuild that shithole.
Iraqi Shi'ite Militias Raze Sunni Villages Soon After Liberating Them From ISIS
Jesus's commandment to "Go out and Baptize all nations in the name of the Father, Son, Holy Spirit."  Besides the fact that this ayah contradicts the other statements in Matthew that /u/g3t_re4l pointed out, it also suffered extensive interpolation. Within the standard Greek text, the trinity isn't even mentioned in the earliest sources. And in the Hebrew text, that entire statement of going to Gentiles doesn't exist.
Thanks - [I finally got a chance to briefly take a look](http://library.islamweb.net/hadith/asaneed.php?bk_no=664 cid=4564 sid=720) (didn't check that the other wordings are identical) - but I may have had bad information here since some of these are at least purportedly hasan. I was taught that cannibalism was haram by ijma and not by an actual textual proof so I must've misunderstood that at some point to have meant there was no textual proof while there seems to be.

Can someone give me, like a proper example to help me understand the term?  Orthodox Muslims get a rap among ignorant bigots in the West because of this concept which has nothing to do w/ 90% of most people claiming to be Muslim. The issue is that Twelver Shi'ites are in modern times a very substantial subset of the overall population and happen to be vocal in media and politics, and this concept is the bedrock of Twelver Shi'ism. [An example of taqiyyah in action:](http://arabic.al-khoei.org/falea.htm)  :                        :       .   That's from the website of al-Kho'i, a venerable mujtahid in modern Twelver religious tradition. He's being asked if it's permissible to lie in debates against "innovators" (non-12ers - i.e. one of the types of taqiyyah) and al-Khoi is clarifying that it is as long as it is useful in winning the debate.  Here's some narrations on the concept from Twelver Shi'ite religious tradition:  http://twelvershia.net/2014/05/29/1184/
I'm going to take a swing and guess "proletariat" is not Reddit's core user base. Apparently your average city cop isn't "working class" according to these clowns.   You can be working class and still be aligned against your own interests, the same way you can be black and vote against your own social interests, or be a poor Christian and vote against your own economic interests. There were Jews in the gestapo...your criticism of their use of the term isn't very well-reasoned.
Ahhhhh... thank you kind sir - have an upvote - I've been googling for about 20 minutes and racking my brain - leave no joke unturned as they say.

That's a literal instruction about literal things - even if the expression "one of its wings" isn't literal. If a fly falls in your drink, you're suppose to dunk it. Have you ever thought about why flies are able to do just fine even though they land in feces and what-not all the time? They have anti-bacterial agents that counteract the 'poisons' their bodies pick up. You dunk the fly in the drink a few times and now in addition to the poisons it added by landing in your drink, it gave you the antibacterial agents from within and without it.
You sure about that?  Yes - it was hyperbole though - to qualify - every substantial sect that originated within the first 500 years after Muhammad that's survived till today. I can't honestly speak to every niche group that pops up and attributes their beliefs to Islam.  And yes, that's all Taqiyyah is, or at least, that's all it is for the 12ers.  So the below is not taqiyyah? What exactly is this sort of permissible lying called?                         	: 	 :       .  http://www.alseraj.net/ar/fikh/1/?XjhPbzfm661074534768 1 30 1
FINALLY!
I wouldn't be surprised if you got shot.  Except that this is the version of events according to the cop - while several witnesses saw a man with his hands ultimately in the air being executed. Regardless of whether the cops version of the beginning of the events is accurate. And if you've dealt with cops anywhere in this country - especially in law, you'll notice that it isn't as a big deal to fudge reports, or even commit outright purgery. Examples abide in r/bad_cop_no_donut and r/law.
No - I think I'm not being clear. What ISIS has released pushes even Islamists away from them. Remember the Taliban? They also put out videos, just like ISIS (not as great production value back then though). Hated by the world, recognized as the legitimate govt of Afghanistan by two countries though. Had quite a popular following and the unpopular decisions they made (like blowing up the Buddha statue) were the sort of things that the international community didn't like but your super devout Muslim could get behind.  And they were with it to the very end - opium production eliminated - crime rates down - people living and moving about in most parts controlled by them with security - even when the world super-power came knocking, they refused to accept foreign intervention and only would agree to handing the accused party over if evidence was served. They had, and have, a large fan base in parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan.  Other Islamist groups? Pakistani Taliban. When Benazir Bhutto was shot and killed, these guys denied it (and legitimately had no role it). When Malala was shot, these guys apologized. They denied accusations and apologized for mistakes - they didn't ignore the former and boast about the later. UIC (before al-Shabbab), somebody opened fire on a movie theatre from amongst their extremists. They were tried and executed. The Islamist group punished its own under the same law applied to everyone else.  Why did Muslims in these regions support groups like Taliban, Hamas, or UIC? Because these groups represented *law* in areas where all that's needed is for a dictator to ask for your head. They represented unbiased establishment of this law, and they believed several of the laws were divinely inspired. They believed - and do believe - that what they're doing is for the good of their society Muslim and otherwise, regardless of what you and I think. I can comprehend that "islamist who wants to live by the quran and hadith without compromise" perspective.  What are the ISIS videos? Let's kill a journalist with no court proceedings and evidence that our action was justifiable. Let's do the same thing with another chap. Let's do it again. Let's get an entire city of average citizens to beat some captured soldiers to death. Then ride their corpses on our motorcycles through the streets. Lets put out tracts that openly allow for slavery in spite of modern connotations. Let's do it without any apologetic material. Let's execute prisoners en-mass, with no depicted attempt at justification. Let's basically give countries an overt excuse to throw a wrench in the stated objective. Let's endanger the lives of the muhajireen (immigrants) who came to Syria during the course of the revolution.  So basically, there's a big difference between what ISIS leadership is self-representing and what those other groups self-represented. They're not currying favor with secular Arabs or devout Sunnis, they've alienated everyone including many of the more crazy devout sort. They are quite literally their own worst enemy (assuming their stated objective is truly their objective).
It definitely needs to be more understood. Especially since a lot of people that will use this to save a penny or two are precisely those that can't shell out for a last minute ticket to get to where they actually need to go.  I dunno that it isn't understood - most people who know about this site and this sort of stuff are generally well-informed about what they'r trying to do. I agree on the premise though, the guy behind the site should be more clear in warning people about risks associated with his tool. That said, he doesn't actually make money off of it as of yet.
It's settled - I'm moving. You guys have some of the best scenery, the [best soft drinks](http://www.urgeusa.com) before us, free high quality education, free high quality medical treatment, are only a nominal part of a nominal number of international conflicts begging repercussions in the future - somebody let me know if there's anything not to love about this place before I book my ticket and rent out my flat?
Because at the time of his death, all we had to go on was the police fabrication that he was threatening the cops with his fake sword. You can't raise fuck-all with a story like that. As for Mike, outside of the Fox News watching half of the country, the fact that somebody stole some cigars and was than gunned down cold in an unrelated shooting certainly isn't controversial - let alone that being a crook isn't a good reason to get gunned down.
There would be a lot less conflict between us if the Muslim world in general would just accept the existence of Israel and stop inciting against Israel and Jews.  I don't know about this incitement against Jews in the Muslim world. I've been fortunate enough to meet, or know of through others, Jewish communities that thrive in Morroco, Syria and Iran. An incitement against Israel? Sure. But against Jews that have been living in Muslim countries for generations and aren't (at least not overtly) gung-ho on the Israel issue, doesn't seem to generally be an issue.  There would be a lot less conflict between us if the Muslim world in general would just accept the existence of Israel and stop inciting against Israel and Jews.  Nobody in the Muslims world doesn't accept the existence of Israel. It's hard not to accept that there isn't a place called 'Israel' on the map nowadays. If you're saying that you hope Muslims would just cow-tow to this recent geo-political change though and accept the new state of affairs into perpetuity, then you've misunderstood your neighbors. The Crusaders lived in Palestine for generations. They had children, and their children had children and their children's children had children -all before those who refused to live as subjects of Salah al-Din were sent packing. As much as you want to maintain the status quo, and many Muslims want to revert it, only time will tell how the Middle East will look in 50 years.
but I just can't take actually watching these videos anymore.  Really? I've said it once and I'll say it again - the production value these guys are putting out is amazing. I've watched a lot of videos over the years put out by different governments to propogandize their military achievements. What's being produced by these non-state actors is some of the best by far.  This one is just a long propaganda clip with a bunch of action (executions, drive-bys, battles, explosions) with a bunch of Arabic anasheed in the background. It starts by encouraging people to oppose 'oppression' and then breaks into the various clips of their activities in the region as well as some posing (going into sujood near large explosions). Very well-edited, practically professionally. They have explosions for instance which if you got a keen eye, you'll know they threw into the video even though they didn't connect. They also use great effects. Around the middle of the film they begin their standard preaching and what-not (the boring stuff) but get right back into the combat footage after a few min.  Edit: Also noticed that whereas with ISIS videos and the like, a lot of the fighters are obviously older men. This video - they're all kids. Almost everyone in the video is under 25. The video is very tailored to the kids without jobs who likely lost family members or friends during the Sisi coup.
They've designed a Caliphate in the modern age with zero air power, and attracted some of the best-equipped militaries around the world to fight a proxy war against them. I don't think they'll let a little bit of 'lack of preperation' or 'not enough metal' get in the way of their delusions.
Nah, it's not that bad. These are just corpses. Iraqi Military Shi'ites burned alive followers of Sarkhi and used to document torture of alleged ISIS members. Here are some of the videos I've posted previously (it's part of the narrative that isn't going to be covered in typical media reports):  http://np.reddit.com/r/Iraq/comments/29t7z4/maliki_shiite_soldiers_cut_the_backs_of_captured/  http://np.reddit.com/r/Iraq/comments/2akqhz/shiite_gunmen_accused_of_mass_execution_of/  http://np.reddit.com/r/Iraq/comments/29xygw/malikis_shiite_soldiers_execute_tied_up_sunni_for/  http://np.reddit.com/r/Iraq/comments/2a124h/malikist_shiites_burn_alive_sarkhist_shiite_and/
