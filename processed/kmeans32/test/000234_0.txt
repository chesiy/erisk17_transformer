What I don't understand is why so many people are so eager to be aggressors. I mean, look at all the facts and avoid war at all costs, right? Even lower- and middle-class people get behind these aggressive ideas (people who have absolutely nothing to gain from war). It's disheartening.

So I've had mild aquaphobia as long as I can remember. Can't deal with water being on my face, especially my eyes and nose, it makes me really anxious and I suddenly have trouble breathing. It's strange. I have anxieties about swimming and have to really force myself to go in. I'm 30 now, and apparently my grandmother accidentally dropped me in a tub when I was a baby (2-3?). I found out from my mom when I was like 25.
