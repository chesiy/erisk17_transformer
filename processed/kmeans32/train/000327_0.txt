I get it. Buy up all you can, pushing the price up of what you already have and then dump it before "Bubbles" the invisible elephant in the room comes in and ruins everything. If this hurts low income earners then they should have studied harder or made better decisions in life. I had a work colleague tell me "being homeless is a choice for most of these people". Much like not attending/coping at work because of depression is a "choice". Mental illness is just an excuse lazy people use to drain decent hard working people of their income. #amirite? Besides it's survival of the fittest.
Thank you!

I said this at the cinema a fortnight ago. Immediately after I though "wtf brain?!?"

Peer pressure
I can understand that. It's just a shame I can't enjoy it as much as others.

Generalised statements with no cited sources   the qoute "For too long cannabis has been seen as a safe drug, but as this study suggests, it can have a really serious impact on your mental health."  Since when has cannabis not been demonized?
Holy shit. I have this on dvd. :(
Tasty. as. fuck.
Out of all the companies I have ordered from online, they have been the best. It's no issue. Just think of it as anything else you order online. The AFP arent going to bust down your door.
That's pretty cool
/r/gaybros take pics of their meetups all the time. Trollx is sorely overdue for such an outing.
I think the only thing missing is blue shower curtains
Man I came here just for the Krs-one reference. Thank you
