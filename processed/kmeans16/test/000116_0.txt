Invalid how so? There are plenty of devs that use windows.  Just read what /u/brtt3000 said:  Windows is still huge, many serious devs and companies have workstations running it.  Look, a product launch can support whatever the fuck it wants to. But to say that asking for windows support is a bit much, *I think* is invalid. Windows still has huge market share, period. By excluding it, you exclude part of the community that actively develops with it.
hey bud don't take it too seriously... it's just a funny way to pass the time here.   If there are people fucking with you just report them.

lol, he's one of these comment trollers, check out his comment history. His favorite method of getting downvotes seems to be by denigrating people with the word  "retard", followed by the sprinkling of misogynist comments and the use of other ideas that go against the reddit "PC".
I believe everything you just said. So can you give insight as to what it would be like to walk on said "super earth"?
I laughed.
Haha, I know. But in all fairness, I was a bit of a troll. Just because I know that a lot of people think it's too spicy. Which is obviously incorrect.   I still love it though.
basically I was reading through the top comments and saw the discussion of whether Fight Club should or should not be mentioned. It had been mentioned there a few times. And then I sorted "controversial" and saw it a few more times. And so when I had landed on this particular comment I thought to myself "that is so brave." And then I said what was in my heart.  If what is in my heart is worth -3 karma, I'll take it. But just know, I died typing from the heart.
Indeed.
an honest question:  Why do you want to pay for something that should be learned through hard work on your behalf? There are many free -- not in the sense of dumbed down articles and tutorials -- resources on the web and in books (not actually free).   The reason I ask is because I'm just assuming that you do not trust the reputation of free information, but realize that I could be wrong.  Seriously though, if you're looking for a way to learn web design my best advice would be to not pay for it with money! Work on building a portfolio of work that you have invested your hard work and time, which in the end is much more valuable. No paid courses are necessarily going to get you there faster. Just tinker, receive criticism, and tinker more.
Alright BobbyBacula, I'm now convinced you're trollin.
You are fucking ridiculous! I never said that that's what I wanted to do. Stop being such a reactionary.   I even began this whole thing with "I honestly don't **feel** so good about it."
I mean, I honestly don't *feel* so good about it. But I'm not sure if there is really any inherent reason for this to be wrong.  For example, I would have no qualms about a 16 year old bringing an 8 year old to an art museum where there were nudes on display (painted, or otherwise). The line between what we deem as "smut" and tastefully done -- is in my mind -- nonexistent.   Furthermore, and why I asked if you had a specific argument, is simply the question of how diegojones4 felt about the whole thing at the time. It seems like he was alright with it. And if that were the case, then quiet literally no one was harmed here.   Is it that you feel sad because you had an innocence at that age that you would like to hold on to, and therefore it bothers you that someone else did not have that same innocence? If that's the case, then, yes spell it out. There's no reason to go on making moral arguments based on silly little feels.
My apologies mate, hope the best for you and you're kids.
There is so much awesome in this.
