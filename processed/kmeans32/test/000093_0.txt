Don't you have anything better to do but bitch and complain? Fuck exists, it's a word, get over it you boring old goat.
First off...nobody on "here" is a "people" just exaggerated versions of what they think they are. Secondly, the internets is not going to help you be a better person, talking to a live human being who you feel is better and wiser than yourself will.
Nigger ladies
The thing is... she really is ugly. I mean... come on people she looks like a fucking horror movie.

If you like your steak well-done, you don't really like steak, do you?
No.
it has Bluetooth... it's just called something different. It's called "WHT." Here is a screenshot of it being paired with my friend's Samsung S3. It also has an SD card slot so you can upgrade the storage yourself. Shut up and do some real research.  http://imgur.com/8Mdc2us

Does Jesus teach people to be ungrateful?
I'm wanting to put my penis inside your friend
If you breed dogs you are a bad person for that choice. If you support dog breeders you are a bad person for that choice. Just because people are happy about what they do doesn't make them good people. My words aren't going to make the bad people go away, but I can point out your flaunting your evil in the faces of reddit users. And you really can only claim ignorance on my behalf when all the humane societies close down due to lack of homeless animals.
We could spend all day Googling shit to support our sides...but the big difference lies in the fact that I don't have an immoral action to defend. This is telling in itself. You are not made a good person because some people may support you.
Those are some weird lookin toes
The other dude doesnt get upset...there is no cringe here, maybe just a slight misunderstanding between buddies.
Grown non-retarded cats don't meow to each other, just humans. Its not their language.
Fucking gross
10 people is pretty good. Here is some simple advice...when you do go out to get groceries or what have you, compliment one random person a day. Sometimes you gotta fake love for a little bit and you will start loving yourself more.
You can tell she was already ruining her feet even at this young age with high heels and small shoes. That big toe angle... dead giveaway and kind of a turn off.
Ewwww bony
Its a portkey
The Very Hungry Thumb: A Visual Exploration of Natural Food Consumption (x-post prettygirlsuglyfaces)
To you ME3 haters. [spoilers]   Were you even playing the game? I've almost finished, making mostly a renegade campaign, and I am deeply affected by the choices I've made. I lied to the Wrex about the Genophage, wiped out the entire Quarian fleet and watched the wreckage burn like fireworks in the sky of their homeworld, mercy-killed an Ardat-Yakshi, watched Tali kill herself....all because of choices I have made (or didn't make). I would say in comparison to ME1 and 2, the choices are much deeper in ME3, more emotionally connected. I really like playing the renegade campaign, and found it pretty easy to play along in ME1 and 2, but in 3, I really can feel the emotional impact of my choices. I can't be the only one who finds this a masterpiece of space opera.   [EDIT] I'm going to get drunk and finish the game tonight so I'll post later and tell you guys my final assessment..but so far its been pretty fun. So far I've gotten my moneys worth.
This fatass needs to lose some weight! He is always getting stuck in the doggy door. WARNING: Dog spoiler.
It's the little things. Bandits killed this young peddler. I re-animated her, and her horse kept following her and nudging her until she faded away. Then he neighed and ran off.
