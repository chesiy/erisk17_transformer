The Night Crew
She hasn't come back, and I haven't heard a word from my manager. I'm assuming she didn't care enough to just call the next day. Either way, it wouldn't have affected me.
LoL! That is a good thing!
LoL! That's what I was thinking! I had completely forgot about hitting it!
That is stupid! I'm glad we didn't have to be as strict about it. I told my manager, it got turned off (suspended?), and it was over
That would be a horrible coincidence!
LoL! I don't think my managers and the police would be as forgiving this time of it happened. It would be horrible if it malfunctioned and went off tonight without me touching it. They'd never believe me!
"I'm not trained for this!"
It's not like Dumbledore could just hand it to them, but if he planted it for them to find. Why would Filch take a random piece of parchment from someone? He would have no clue what it was.
Yep! It's a place for scary stories and experiences, but remember when commenting, you take everything you read as true no matter how outlandish it might be!
Sorry if I upset you! This was a girl in my class not me. I thought it was absurd and was curious as to what others thought!
Well, lucky for you! There's a more recent one coming out this year! :)!
Yes, future. That doesn't prove it hasn't happened. Also, no bragging. I wouldn't want to be one of the people who are accused of "asking for it" because of the way I was dressed
How do you know the last part? For all you know, I could have been. Had things said to me before, and now avoid it all.

As i said to someone else, if you want the email to the professor who told us this, I'll happily pm it to you. I have no problem with you asking him
I'm not stereotyping people that get raped. I'm using questions that people actually ask when people get raped. Anyone can be raped. I know this. I don't believe anyone was "asking for it". If it ever happens, I would rather people that believe that have no room to talk.
Thank you! I don't let it bother me. I understand that this isn't a problem and extreme worry for other, and it's okay that they don't understand. You have to be ready for that anytime you make a post! I'm just glad you've understood this and take it seriously.
Thank you so much! I'll definitely try those!
Every cat owner knows this...
There was a story a lot like your's. I don't remember the name exactly, but she completely ignored its presence and it dissipated after awhile. Might try that.
I think that the pros just didn't like Reach and 4, so they quit because most of them came back for MCC competitions.
Sure will! :)
I'm getting him a baby sock for Christmas!

It's a good thing that I work nightshift, and only have to see her an hour every shift
My manager has no clue what my job is...   Please excuse grammar and formatting! I'm on mobile   I work in a regional grocery store putting up signs and changing price tags. Corporate expects 1089 tags hung in 8 hours. My department manager was on vacation. I'm the only one trained to do my job and his, so I'm doing both of our jobs for only 50 cents more. My company doesn't allow overtime, so I had to ask the store manager to let me leave early because I had 5000 tags to hang in one night. Clearly, I couldn't get it done, so I was gonna go over. When I ask him, he seems confused about why I have so many hours. I inform him that since my boss is on vacation that's I'm working both jobs. He's still confused about why my department gets 40 hours a week. We hang every sale sign and make sure every price is right every day.  Fast forward to later that day, I'm walking around the store making sure all our major sale signs are correct. Up comes the store manager, he asks if I will clean the break room. He didn't seem urgent, and he didn't specify when. I agree assuming he means after I check prices which is more important. Not 5 minutes later, he runs back up to me asking if I cleaned the break room. I reply, "Sorry, Sir. I was going to do it after I checked prices." He proceeds to yell in my face and tell me we have "enough" signs. So I drop what I'm doing to clean the PRIVATE break room.  I'm finally done with the break room and go back to the floor. As I walk past the deli area, I hear douche manager yelling at them for not having a sign up that they had asked me to make, so I walk over, give him my nicest smile, and say "Sir, I was on my way to make that sign when you told me we had enough and that cleaning the break room was more important." He storms away because I didn't do anything to actually get in trouble.  Fast forward not even 20 minutes later, he comes to find me to ask if I'll make a sign for a bread rack. When I go to check prices, I realize they're all different prices, and I don't have room to make a sign for every thing. I tell my manager. He yells in my face again asking why I can't just do my job. I proceed to walk over to the rack and make a sign for the cheapest item on there so if anyone complains about the price of a more expensive item on the rack, they'll get it for the price of the cheapest one. Clearly, my manager hasn't a clue about my job!  Edit: Minor grammar fixes
I'm sorry you went through that!
I don't know if you looked at The Noble Collection online. They have a lot of cool stuff!
The book that has stuck with my is Loose Girl: A Memoir of Promicuity by Kerri Cohen. It really makes you think about why people act the way they do, and not to judge people by their sexual history. I have to pick it up once a year and re-read it. Anytime I see some one (boy or girl) acting in a promiscuous way, I think of that book, and it reminds me that despite their actions, he/she is a person and deserves respect (reasonably) and might just need some one to be in their life consistently.
My mom isn't a Harry Potter fan, but I always bonded with my step dad over it. After he passed away, she helped me organize a Harry Potter Marathon in his memory with close friends and then bought me the Wizarding Collection despite the high price. Now we are going to the Harry Potter theme park (my last vacation with my step dad), and she's taking my boyfriend with us for support in case I can't handle being there.
