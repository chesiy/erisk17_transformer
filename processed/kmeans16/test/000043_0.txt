You have an adorable smile
I actually really liked season 9. It wasn't the same show, but it had a lot of potential. It should have been its own spinoff, as opposed to being tacked on to the end of the original show. The first time I re-watched the whole series, I was left wanting to see more of those characters. Season 9 may not have been as good as the first 8 seasons, but it could have been. Hell, it's way better than what they tried to do with the interns in season 8. Denise was the only salvageable part of that mess.
Performance anxiety and what you're describing as rape, are two completely different things. There's so much more to an erection than the want to have sex. Not to mention the fact that consent isn't as easy as black and white. Also, you're assuming that male rape is when a man has penal-vaginal intercourse with a woman.
Welcome to Game of Thrones!
Trouble encoding 1080p files   Running [Windows 7](http://imgur.com/gDygYT2), using Adobe Media Encoder. Whenever I bring in an AfterEffects composition and render out a Quicktime file using the H.264 codec at 720p, it works fine. The problem is occurring when I try to render it out at 1080p. The render fails as soon as it starts, and the Error Log simply says "Error compiling movie. Unknown error." Why is this happening, and what can I do to fix it?
Ok, am I the only one who's tired of girls like this "oh, i'm curious whether or not I look good." Girl, please, you know you look amazing! Don't act like you don't know that your eyes are impossibly stunning, or your face isn't unbelievably beautiful, and don't even get me started on that smile, casue I honestly, can't even find the words. And then you top it off with a body picture, that honestly, looks like you belong in a magazine. The only negative thing I can say is that you're too perfect, but that's just being petty at this point, lol.
You are gorgeous. You have an infectious smile, and from what I can tell, your body looks amazing. If anything, you look even cuter post-preggo.
You don't have to tell me twice.

Not sure who she is, but that picture has been around for a long time. She may be a nobody.
