I went deep in my genealogy online and without paying.  A lot of what I did was Google an ancestor and some kind of year (birth, death) in quotes: *"John Doe" "1887"*.  Maybe a general location if I was getting too many false hits.    I am not sure how accurate this method is, but it seemed to work for me.

This wasn't isolated.  But it would be difficult to get a cancer this large in any other school.

**RMS Lusitania** was a British ocean liner, that left New York for Liverpool on what would be her final voyage on 1 May 1915 (the day of this article).   The sinking and deaths of 1,198 passengers and crew help bring the United States into World War I, which officially started today (July 28, 1914).  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Lusitania
