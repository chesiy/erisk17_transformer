Aye, I'm more worried about the digital bread-crumbs people are unknowingly leaving around from even a 5 minute surf on the web. If I can get my f   f doing something about that, then I'll move them onto more robust protections for their devices overall.  Though I'll end up automating most of that, if previous experience is anything to go by. Not that I blame people, if a car mechanic starts explaining the intricacies of engine repair my eyes start to glaze over after a few minutes. So I reckon most people feel that way about computer security   privacy.
Just spotted the end of no. 1, my sister hasn't seen the last one so I've another movie on the roster.  My all-time (chosen) movie record on Christmas Day is 7. I'll be nowhere near that today, but hey I can still type so that's new for this hour ;)
To reveal the target and methods in court wouldn't make sense, but to hide the fact of the court case is the thing that really worries me.  Tell the judge 'in camera' about the details, but the fact of a foreign government requesting Irish data from companies should not be hidden. We should be able to see how many times it happens, and whether it's getting worse year on year.  I guess this will make the US government's case against Microsoft for data held on their Irish servers much easier too.  I can really see now why Fine Gael have never been elected to Dil governance twice in a row.
A fairly astonishing one considering the subject matter
Nah, I'll give the attractiveness to the dude.  On the flipside, the dude incurs the risk of 'did I ever tell you about the Cheetah' re-runs, and so creating the potential for widescale Kif-quakes in his well quiffed presence.  On 2nd t, you're probably right
Just tried his name via DuckDuckGo and there are plenty of links about it, couldn't see the Herald one admittedly.  This one is a toughie I reckon, I can see why maybe after 5 or 10 years - someone should be allowed to 'live things down' especially when there's no obvious 'public interest', the event isn't a continuing one or the people involved aren't politicians etc.  But it's just going to be so near-impossible, then the Streisand effect ...
Jesus Tapdancing Christ, can the government set up a commissioner to slap Phil Hogan every time he wants a glass of water!  And:  It was confirmed yesterday by Taoiseach Enda Kenny that Irish Water is to be taken out of the control of the Department of Environment, which is now run by Labour's Alan Kelly, and brought under the auspices of Michael Noonan's Department of Finance.  If Fine Gael think they'll survive privatising water, I'd like to see them try.
I think this says more about E3 than No Man's Sky.   Many AAA ~~games~~ publishers seem to follow Hollywood (teasers, trailers, reveals ... ) rather than capitalising on games' unique opportunities with a Hollywood flair.   The AAA scene is hamster-wheeling on pre/se-quels.   So I'm waiting till games reach the bargain-bin as there's no rush to play re-skinned games anyway. Though these days that means little against pre-order sales.  I hope No Man's Sky is great and maybe it becomes the 'Forbidden Planet' of sci-fi gaming.  Yet for every 'reveal' of any game I see - I think of one of the first reddit comments I read:  Actual Gameplay Video or GTFO
My guess is Monday will lead to a few more. Though the voting for who is on it will just start again, and then there will be a new government majority.   If it was just going to be a chance to tarnish FF with the details, you'd imagine Enda wouldn't be too bothered about the panel's make-up. So I'm guessing there are a few shameful deeds from the current government that need to brushed under the carpet.  He's like a school-teacher who has been given the troublesome students, and now doesn't want anyone to know they've gotten worse under his watch.
Very possibly, though we don't know how much the water will cost per litre yet ;)  Though for [the numbers](http://www.independent.ie/business/personal-finance/want-to-dodge-water-bills-with-a-well-heres-the-drill-30053308.html), it's around 4,500 to 5,000 - you can get a grant which will cover no more than 2,031.58. So around 3,000 all in.  If water charges are at the estimated 420 per year, then ~7 years using as much water as you like! Of course if the water charges go up, then it would take less time to recoup the investment. Plus it won't have that taste of treatment.
Another snippet from the Navan count:  Labour is not singing in a chorus on the leadership elephant in the room.  A Labour councillor who has lost his seat on Kells town council in Meath has said that Eamon Gilmore should go as the leader of the party if he has any respect for the membership and the people on the ground. Having served on the town council for ten years, Brian Collins was eliminated this morning at the Navan count centre having polled just 395 first preference votes. He said: Im gutted for myself but its been humiliating nationally."  @13.34 - http://liveblog.irishtimes.com/34369da214/LIVE-Election-Count/
I can't imagine what it would be like to have been bereaved or damaged by all that violence, yet then presented with a 'blank slate from now on' type solution.  For those that have managed, they have my enduring admiration and a little wonder - bestest Buddhas in the world, I reckon.

"As Bible-believing Christians [must meet the other type], we will also turn our attention to the tragic compromise and downgrade of so many once-sound fundamentalist, Evangelical churches."  I dont consider myself extreme at all  I would  if I had the power  make homosexuality a criminal offence once again. I would also make adultery a criminal offence, so Im pretty fair in that respect."  "The Islam threat is in the form of halal meat"  Eh wa shuh wha?  These are psychiatric symptoms not policy models.
In fairness, all of those points are **their job** - for which they are paid more than adequately.  Have we reached a point where we expect so little from the Dil that TDs turning up and doing what they're elected to do is laudable?  Here are some other achievements:  * Held a referendum on a stability fund that we can't access a year and a half before we would have needed it anyway. Losing a negotiating position in the process. * Asserted the need for a pay-cap in public positions, which is then flouted by the Taniste. * Let the Minister for Justice mislead the Dil after he revealed a TD's penalty point situation live on national TV. None of which jeopardises his job. * Failed to address the shortcomings of the Data Protection Commissioner which has now lead to the drafting of new EU laws, one of which is specifically designed to avoid the need for EU citizens to go through that Irish office to make complaints. * Allowing a debt defaulter to be in charge of the country's biggest budget which, surprise surprise, he can't balance. * Failed to address the egregious loopholes exploited by foreign multinationals which sees a certain company pay 0.14% in tax, instead of 12.5%. Meanwhile Irish companies the absolutely vast employers of people in Ireland see new levies, taxes   rates while remaining on 12.5%. Corporate welfare at its finest. * Introduced a Property tax   soon a Water charge which makes a mockery of maintaining basic social welfare rates and rates of income tax. * Increased school classroom numbers which are now the highest in Europe. * Fails to acknowledge that much of recovery in this country would not have been possible without the ~400,000 people who have left Ireland over the past 5 years for work.
I use an Odroid U2 as a home server, NAS, book server, torrenting machine, motion server and all of that barely stresses it.  They've upgraded it now to the [U3](http://hardkernel.com/main/products/prdt_info.php) (an extra USB port, slimmer profile). It's $59 before shipping and is even slightly smaller than the Pi :)  There's loads of tips and projects on the [forums](http://forum.odroid.com/) too. I use one as my main desktop too as they're fanless and silent.  Just to add, I still use my Pi for XBMC as its gpu is better at 1080p than the Odroid's, though not by much.
