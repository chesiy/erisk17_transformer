The reason this is possible is the same reason that workers everywhere (blue and white collar) are having wages stolen from them: unequal bargaining power.  The rich have little need for money, so they can be all that more demanding in contract terms, which leads to workers giving up more of their labor for less, and the wealthy becoming wealthier *because* they are wealthy.  This is not a natural system --- it was created this way.  Wealthy right wingers argue that we should socialize costs for the protection of property but not for anything else.  Of course, this just happens to benefit them the most.
Many great suggestions here, but some of my all time faves are missing.    Here are some I consider must-see films (on any list).  I think these each represent the greatest work by each of these directors:  1. Hidden Fortress (Kurosawa) - the inspiration for Star Wars. 2. Black Orpheus (Camus) 3. Contempt (Goddard) 4. Divorce Italian Style (Gremi) 5. The Seventh Seal (Bergman) 6. La Strada (Fellini)  I would have put Night of the Hunter up here, but someone already mentioned it.  And now some other fun ones, concentrating on things you may not have heard of:  7. The Game 8. Kwaidan - 3 incredibly beautiful Japanese horror stories 9. Sanjuro / Yojimbo (Kurosawa) - inspirations for Clint Eastwood's  "Man with No Name" classic films. 10. Seduced and Abandoned (Gremi) - if you enjoy Divorce Italian style 11. Spellbound (Hitchcock)
Look at their histories.  Obama had literally no track record *at all* of fighting for progressive policy.  At Harvard Law, he was known for intermediating between two sides.  At Kerry's nominating convention he gave a famous speech "One America, not two Americas", which advocated centrism and bipartisanship.  During the primaries he praised Reagan, supported  immunity of the telecom companies which participated in domestic spying programs, supported conserva-Dem Joe Lieberman over the excellent progressive Joe Lamont.    Obama even said that supporters were misconstruing him as a progressive.  He made a point of saying that "there are extremes on both sides" that are not helpful.   The man made it as clear as day that he was a centrist.  Voters were not paying attention.    Warren has had a *long* track record of fighting for the middle class.  She first came to public notice when, as a professor at Harvard, she gave a talk called ["The Coming Collapse of the Middle Class"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akVL7QY0S8A ).   It's worth watch in full.  Since then, Warren identified a part of the problem as the lack of accountability of the big banks, which allowed them to privatize their gambling risks and socialize their losses.  She pushed for a new Federal agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which makes regulations preventing financial institutions from cheating consumers.  Republicans prevented her from becoming head of the agency, but she won that major victory.  That agency is estimated to have saved consumers some billions of dollars in excessive charges (too lazy to provide a link, but easily googleable).  She has been extremely sharp-tongued in calling out Republicans.  She has not said "both sides are the problem".  She has even called out Obama and his centrist nominees, recently scuttling Wall Street stooge Antonio Weiss.  She's fought for cheaper loans for students ("If banks get .75%, why can't students get that too?").  Just do a bit of research on her.    The woman is a progressive firebrand that Obama never was and never said he was.
edit: I guess people do, it is dumb though  Why?  It's a pretty standard political phrase for identifying a faction in a political party by their ostensible leader.    E.g., "The Ted Cruz wing of the Republican party". http://newsbusters.org/blogs/tim-graham/2014/12/30/washpost-conservatives-slam-ted-cruz-wing-gop-too-much-clarity  And it's pretty much undisputed that Warren is seen as the leader of the progressives.
Ok, which one of you is this.  http://i.imgur.com/s4p9Ow5.png
I'm not asking to be taken seriously.  I'm asking for a cogent argument, but you haven't given one, seem to be offended by that, and now are calling me names.  Enough for me.    Good luck with your "trades".  No doubt the government will step in to ensure the solvency of your industry when you geniuses blow up the world again.
Please read the words of the US prosecutor at the Nuremberg trials, Justice Robert Jackson of SCOTUS:  ["And let me make clear that while this law is first applied against German aggressors, the law includes, and if it is to serve a useful purpose it must condemn aggression by any other nations, including those which sit here now in judgment."](http://www.roberthjackson.org/the-man/speeches-articles/speeches/speeches-by-robert-h-jackson/opening-statement-before-the-international-military-tribunal/ )
I note with some exasperation, by the way, that he feels the need to throw some imprecations regarding the financial industry into an article about an issue that has nothing to do with it.   Let me defend him.  I think his insight is quite apropos.  There is a mounting frustration that the entire game is rigged.  People on the bottom get treated brutally for tiny infractions, while elites get away with crimes.  That certainly is part of the cultural zeitgeist.     In Berkeley and Oakland, a large number of the demonstrators are self-identified Occupy activists. It's a very short leap for these people to connect the same dots that Taibbi has. The original target of Occupy was Wall Street, which activists argued were essentially stealing from the public, but which the government was unwilling to police.  Now, these same people are out on the streets angry that powerless people are over-policed.  That is Taibbi's argument in a nutshell.  In the original protests, the police, were largely perceived as preserving public order, though there was a sense, because of their occassional overzealousness that they stood on the side of the "elite criminals of Wall Street" (i.e., from the perspective of the activists).  Yet, that role was only incidental.  As a result of the Ferguson/Garner protests, police themselves are now the issue.  So, in the eyes of the protesters, they have gone from being an instrument protecting elite criminals to themselves being criminals themselves in need of policing.    That is what Taibbi is talking about.  Those activists on the ground are starting to see the police themselves as illegitimate.  That is a sea change.  I think you'll agree that in this light, the stats you cite (from 2011, no less) aren't really in scope here.  This is a question of what will happen at the next demonstration, now that police themselves are seen as part of the problem.   And in fact, [recent polls support the argument that, amongst minorities at least, confidence has been lost](http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/poll-shows-deep-racial-divide-confidence-law-enforcement-n263041 ):    And while 72 percent of the public and 79 percent of whites say that they have "a great deal" or "a fair amount" of confidence that police in their community will not use excessive force on suspects, just 43 percent of black Americans say the same.  Conservatives are unlikely to see things this way because it doesn't fit their narrative, but their opinions don't matter in this.  A powerful anger is brewing which inequities and injustices will continue to feed, meaning that there will be more protests.  What will happen at the next one and the next one after that now that those protesters see the police as illegitimate?
That is not what the article says.  You're reading the conclusion you'd like to see.   Police officers get that benefit of the doubt at every step along the way.   And   The lack of serious second-guessing is baked into the system.  And  Still, even that low-end estimate suggests that police shoot and kill someone in the United States more than once a day, on average. The overwhelming majority of those killings are deemed justified before the case ever reaches a jury.  And  Meanwhile, as FiveThirtyEights Ben Casselman has argued, prosecutors rely on the police to do their jobs day in and day out, so they have few reasons to prosecute a cop aggressively and plenty of incentive to present a less persuasive case than they might otherwise, consciously or not.  And     Those cases certainly exist, even if they are likely more uncommon than is generally accepted.... In reality, its a wonder that any cop ever gets indicted for killing someone in the line of duty.  Say the opposite.
I know some like that too, and don't have a ton of sympathy for them.  But I think it's important to look at the big picture.  At the macro level  the middle class is working harder, longer hours, being more productive, and getting paid less.  George Bush said it well when [he complimented a woman on having 3 jobs]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIjo-dWE1Jg ).  "That is uniquely American, isn't it?"  Well, the truth is that it's the *modern* American condition, what we've been left with - two parents having to work just to make ends meet - while the tiny sliver at the top take all the societal gains.. Those few at the top with vast wealth, much of it inherited, can fail their way through life and still land on top because of the structure of modern capitalism.  Owning capital means you get rewarded with profit on work someone else did.  And our society is increasingly becoming one where it pays better to own than work.
(continuing my comment) Now look at this piece in WaPo http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/09/14/bernie-sanders-would-run-for-president-against-wall-street-not-hillary-clinton/  The media is telling the story without him having to beat up on Hillary himself.  It's much better for his story to get told this way.
Typical JPost garbage, perfectly illustrates pro-Israeli arguments:  ignore the main issue, the bombing of a densely packed open air prison filled with people whose homes have been stolen, and instead talk about lofty words in Israel's constitution.  This bit was particularly funny.   "Israel has never had laws that overtly discriminated between citizens on the basis of race."  There are more than 50 Israeli laws that discriminate against Palestinian citizens of Israel in all areas of life, including their rights to political participation, access to land, education, state budget resources, and criminal procedures. Some of the laws also violate the rights of Palestinians living in the 1967 OPT and Palestinian refugees.   http://adalah.org/eng/Israeli-Discriminatory-Law-Database
No, I agree that is pretty clearly biased.   Yet, a lot of this article rung true to me.  I think Clinton, if elected President, will be a disaster for progressives.  I've heard nothing out of her mouth that I believe.  Even when she talked about income inequality recently at the Aspen Ideas conference, it sounded like she was bullshitting.  She so carefully couched her words that it seemed like a nod and a wink to her fellow globalists: "just what the proles want to hear, don't you know".  That has been my impression, anyway.
Sadly, Warren is a two-issue candidate, with those issues being financial reform,  and being a woman who is not Hillary.   That is just plain wrong.  She's been quite prominent on unions, domestic wiretapping, taxation, education loan reform, workplace safety, civil rights, bankruptcy, corporate power, and energy policy.     In 2008 we fielded a candidate with a formidable progressive brand and platform rather than a formidable progressive record.  Warren has an incredible record for her short tenure, unlike Obama.   And Obama was not a progressive;  he even stated that publicly, saying that his ardent followers were attributing their politics to him incorrectly.  And he proved this in the primaries by supporting telecom immunity (against wiretapping charges) and Joe Lieberman over the progressive Ned Lamont, just to name a couple of issues.  Obama was at best a cypher if you weren't paying attention, but it was actually pretty obvious in the primaries that he was a conservative.
Everything about 9/11 is designed to impart very specific political messages, since the day it happened. Krugman deviated from the approved, mandatory political script by pointing out that it isn't only the Terrorists but also ourselves who engaged in deeply shameful crimes.
