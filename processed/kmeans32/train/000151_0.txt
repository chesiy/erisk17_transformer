IMDb shows that 'The Girl Who Played With Fire' Is being made and is being directed by 'David Fincher'. What are your thoughts on the sequel being made ??   [Here is the IMDb Link](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1703246/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_1)
'Brazil' and its hidden messages. Could someone elaborate ??   I have been always pondering about the movie for a long time now. This is what I always thought about the movie :   The country in which the movie takes place is a mixture of both the United States and Germany. Sometimes, the movie hints at Germany and sometimes at the United States. Let's start of with the main character - Sam Lowry. He is a normal guy. Who wants a normal job. He loves old music. But, Is always unable to listen due to the government poking their nose in his affairs (Stasi reference maybe ?? ). Then, there is the infamous Flying scene where Lowry is trying to save a damsel in distress. But, he is constantly being stopped by forces such as huge walls (Berlin Wall maybe ?? ). There is a scene where a bomb explodes in the restaurant but the people seem to be going on casually after it explodes showing how they have been brain-washed by the government to believe that everything is okay (Censorship and prohibition of free-speech.)   Sam Tuttle (De Niro) represents whistle blowers and the group of resistance who always oppose the Government. He always points the common people in the right direction.  Could someone tell me if I am interpreting this the wrong way ?? How did you feel after watching the movie ?? What do you think the movie is about ??

**Interstellar**.   Nolan made it in 1999. But, thought that it was too advanced for the public and believed that it would be snubbed. So, our savior has time-travelled from 1999 to 2014 to show us this gem of a movie.   Hope It won't be snubbed in the 2015 oscars. Seig Heil.   P.S I'm in 2012 . Browsing Dank Memes. Brb.

Can't tell if this is either clever marketing or legit post.

As someone who was just like you, I have recently started collecting blu-rays. I think it is really worth if you respect the art form of movies. Here is my piece of advice :  * Learn about the region coding of blu-ray discs and players. Buying a region-free blu-ray player is a great advantage if you want to import from other countries.  * Work you way through bargains and box-sets first. This really helps to start a collection.  * You might wanna wait and see if 4k blu-rays, which will be released by the end of the year are reasonably priced or not. If they are, then you could buy a 4k blu-ray player (If you have a 4k TV or if you are planning to buy so in the near future).

I think it is one of the best and most ambitious sci-fi movie of it's time.I loved the movie.The ending was perfect.It was more like a ending after the ending,which i liked.  If contact would have been made now ... it would have been a smash hit.
Here.. have my glorious upvote
Does Ubisoft need to step into making mainstream sports games ??   After seeing that EA has taken a huge leap from fifa 14 to fifa 15 and having stepped up the franchise quality (no sarcasm).... Isn't it time for ubisoft to try and make a sports game ?? Maybe not something like fifa but maybe some sort of Galactic Football-ish game ?? And offer some competition to EA ??
