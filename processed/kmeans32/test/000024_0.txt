Yellen: First Fed rate hike likely later this year
It's hard to compare players of different age groups. E.g. Buffon vs. Courtois vs Neuer, how do you compare these people for one position when there is like 10 years between each of them?

Maybe you are right, but I'd argue that there are very few names that get remembered over time (this is not to say Villa is bad).  Just consider Spain alone, in the past 10 years or so, I'd say Xavi, Iniesta, Casillas, Raul are bigger names than him (not comparing skills here, just saying these names are more well-known), and probably Puyol, Ramos are at his level. There you've got 7 or 8 names already for that decade, so in 50 years basically there would be 40 or so players of, roughly speaking, his level or better. I doubt anyone could remember 40 names from one country (even if it's your country) unless if something special happened that made you remember him.  And plus, people tend to remember more recent players and forget old ones. How many players from the 1960s can you name?
It's just for fun, don't take it too serious.  And, they are actually pretty good for US   Canada.
What I mean by easier is also not to say the learning is easier. But generally speaking, summer instructor will tend to keep marks slightly higher, for various internal reasons.
Well said.  I think as a Chinese player playing at his level, the state will have an important say on your career, perhaps even more than you and your family. The state may make certain decisions and "recommend" those to you. So yeah, not saying that he will necessarily do well, but he definitely won't be like Josh Waitzikin, who just suddenly ditched chess.
It is interesting that you bring up the metaphorical aspect, and you could totally be right. It would be interesting to see if this season explores the supernatural aspect, just like the first seasons.
Varrock is my pick.
He did not say the result was representative, in fact, at the bottom he explicitly said the result is NOT representative.  The last thing to keep in mind here is that people who answered this question primary come from Reddit and Voat, so naturally, we are expecting the younger generation here (likely around the 2030 range). Gallup, for example, did similar polls and their results (which should be more representative) demonstrate entirely different results.
ELI5: Why do some software developers only make one software available on the Mac but not the PC?   My friend is a designer and he uses the Mac only because he uses a software (I think it's called Sketch) for his job and this software is only available for Mac users. Why don't they also make a PC version?
Do you think Greece will remain in the EU given its growing concern of defaulting, and will you adjust your investment strategies accordingly?   Question 1: Do you think Greece will remain in the EU given its growing concern of defaulting?  I've created a poll to help tally up opinions. Please vote http://thearima.com/questions/do-you-think-greece-will-remain-in-the-eu-given-its-growing-concern-of-defaulting.  My personal guess this some sort of bailout will be reached at the end (as that's what has always happened). Greece will remain in the EU.  Question 2: Will you adjust your investment strategies in the next few days/weeks according?  I bought some VIX etfs last week, and have happily enjoyed my 30% gain today. Given my answer to the first question (i.e. they will stay in the EU), I would likely clearly out my position in the next few days as I think the VIX index will rise a bit more and then go back down.  I'd love to hear your thoughts!
I wonder who would date him?

NHL Draft: Top 10 prospects
Building some wonders yourself will make your battles easier (e.g. build the great wall yourself, or status of zeus). Some wonders (like the Oracle) have a one time effect, so I tend to build those myself as well, if possible.
So essentially, Juventus sells half of him for 10m, and buy 100% of him for 18m next season? That sounds pretty good.

[Season 5] What did you think about season 5 of Game of Thrones? (Poll)
It's not the worst since it's not part of your so-to-say core courses, but still failing a course does not make your transcript look good.  I am assuming what you are taking is MAT223 (correct me if I am wrong), and since this course usually does not curve students, I'd recommend speaking with your instructor immediately and explain your situation to him/her (e.g. I don't come from math and am taking the course for my own curiosity, I need to go to grad school for reasons xyz, blah blah blah). Sometimes this will help because the instructor is often a student (grad) himself, so they have some sympathy for students (not always true though) and maybe would bump up your mark by a few points. I'd also recommend seeing him in person (prepare your speech) instead of sending emails.  Other than that, not much I can suggest. Perhaps take some easy courses to make up for your GPA if you failed or did badly.
Why this has been the worst year for American Muslims since 9/11
I almost never rely on hotels and airports for culture wins. It's all about the digs   great works. And plus, if you found a religion and go for the reform where all religious buildings get 2 tourism, that makes culture really simple.

Texas policeman resigns after video shows him toppling teen
personally, I don't spend too much money on cases, only $100 something. I wonder how much an average player would spend on something that is purely aesthetic.
Keep on hearing people say deity is so easy, blah blah blah, so I'm really curious how good people really are. Personally, I've never defeated Immortal or Deity.
I didn't meant to say it was my own. Just found it funny and post it here.
I think this will prevent a lot of people from using, or trying, your service. I don't have amazon, and I probably won't get one just for your site. I suggest maybe add Paypal/other payment methods, or at least make the trial one available for non-amazon users.
Thanks for the links!
Here are my suggestions,  1) Do NOT start with writing a business plan (especially if your idea is around the internet). Not saying that they are useless (which I believe so), but your time could be used elsewhere.  2) If you have little cash, you better have someone who can code. This can be either through finding a CTO (your classmates, friends, people you find on LinkedIn, Angelist etc), or learn to code yourself (e.g. Codecademy). In these days, it's very hard to raise money from investors with just ideas.   3) Start with building an MVP. Find a decent designer (this you will have to pay for, because you can learn coding but design you cannot learn quickly) and make your site look pretty, visual is important.  3) Go and talk to people with your MVP (once you have it done) and see what they say. Have them sign up for a beta or collect user interest. You may be able to get some investment with an MVP, and then that's when you can start hiring developers.
