Fun fact: RELOADED releases some silly games under the group DOGE.  https://www.reddit.com/r/warezscene/comments/2xow33/reloaded_releasing_movies_under_doge/
They're actually using the Razor1911 logo in one of their stores, check the last one in http://www.razor1911.es/DondeEstamos.aspx
Seems legit.
Yhup, and marked as spam [here](http://pre.corrupt-net.org/index.php?q=group:Razor1911). God, I was so hyped.
If you mean key store sites... I got BF4 Premium from G2A it worked fine. But after the Ubisoft fiasco (I wasn't affected), I became skeptical about these sites. I know you'll argue "but it workz 4 me!", but to me buying from G2A/Kinguin/etc is no different than buying a cheap DVD from a street seller and praying it works fine.
Exactly. Or... well... actually... **FIFA.13.INTERNAL-RELOADED** Note: This release is meant for our sites, its ops and users, and those who request it.
I don't wish we had less Steam releases. In fact, it's quite the opposite, since there's much more scene competition with Steam. My point is that protections are getting tougher to crack, specially if you follow the old scene rules, and it's easy to see that groups are avoiding such DRMs and sticking with simpler ones like Steam, which one day may be in danger as well, since DRMs tend to get tighter over time, not worse.

My parents used to go to the supermarket thinking I would close the door when they left. And I usually did, but  one day I had my ear plugs on as I was studying, and didn't hear them leave. After a while, I seem to hear some small noise. I open the door and there are 2 filthy gypsy women in the kitchen. My heart starts racing and I pretend I believe their "oh we thought this home was for rent - or is it your neighbor's?" bullshit, as I'm physically weak and don't want trouble. One of them asked to go to the bathroom while the other one kept developing that fake story. When my parent's arrived, besides cleaning the toilet, they noticed some gold stuff we had (like necklaces we've been offered at our birth) had gone missing.  Now I'm just hoping the government decides to cut welfare for these pieces of cancer. But I doubt it, in Europe we love supporting those who not only do nothing for us, but also damage our lives :)
It boggles me how people from Western cultures are so tolerant with an outdated culture that doesn't even respect human rights. Swedes really need to open their eyes, because once the 3rd world immigrants are there doing bad stuff, there won't be an easy way to revert the situation.
Yes, I like the way you think, Mr. EA's CEO. Take a sh!t on paying costumers by making a singleplayer game dependent on a stable server connection. And yeah, the online DRM totally worked with Simcity. Everyone could play the game when it was released, and EA got so much love for it. Just like Ubisoft did with their always online DRM a few years ago. Last, but not least, a new study showed that games with aggressive DRM usually sell more. Take a look at Sims 3, for example, it had an uncrackable DRM (CD checks, lol) and thanks to that it sold 10 million units.
It's not impressive at all. The guy who killed you just needs to lock at the vehicle, shoot it a little bit to the left/right and after 2/3 shots you're dead. I've done this a lot from the Skyscraper in Siege of Shangai to snipers in other buildings and it's so easy.
How did you extract the texture?
Ha, it is indeed. I've spent 15+ hours trying to patch an unpacked VisualBasic program, but still can't. By going deeper into the calls before the conditional jumps that decide *goodboy* or *badboy*, I couldn't find the place where the serial verification is done at startup, and that can get frustrating.
Not until now. Thanks for the heads up, it's an interesting read :)
