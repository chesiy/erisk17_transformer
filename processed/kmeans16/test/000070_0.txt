KU, other state colleges propose tuition increases of 3.6 percent
In case there is a pay wall,  The Senate joined the House by approving a session-ending bill Friday making adjustments to legislation imposing a state tax increase of $432 million next year that constitutes the largest in Kansas history.  Public begging and private bullying that defined the session's votes on tax policy prompted adoption by the bare minimum -- 21 votes in the Senate, 63 in the House -- of legislation  endorsed by Gov. Sam Brownback and designed to respond to a projected $400 million deficit in the fiscal year starting July 1.  The House came up with a slightly different mix of tax additions than was passed Sunday by the Senate, which required the upper chamber to vote on a bill matching the House action. That bill was in peril on Friday afternoon until Sen. Rob Olson, R-Olathe, changed his vote to "yes" and provided the ending margin.  In recent days, heavy political muscle was applied to GOP lawmakers to vote for a tax increase or face a primary election opponent in August 2016.  The Brownback administration also triggered a public backlash by declaring failure to raise taxes could result in sweeping budget reductions in Kansas higher education.  The battle to frame the tax increase in a politically palatable way erupted on the Senate and House floors.  "I view this as tax reform, not a tax hike," said Sen. Julia Lynn, an Olathe Republican who voted for the measure.  Sen. Jeff Longbine, R-Emporia, said the tax package was deficient in many ways but voted for the legislation because it might not improve if the session was prolonged. He denounced tactics used to persuade legislators to vote for revenue enhancements.  "We've had blackmail from the executive branch to the legislative branch," he said. "We've had blackmail within this body."  Brownback, in a meeting Thursday with Republicans in the House and Senate, said he was desperate to make a deal.  "I'm pleading with you, really," he said.  That GOP gathering helped inspire passage by the House of a two bills revising tax law, but likely requiring Brownback to take a knife to state spending in the next fiscal year. The chamber slipped over the hurdle around 4 a.m. Friday after hard-core conservatives who had stiff-armed leadership and the governor for weeks folded.  "Colleagues, weve had a long session, but our diligence has paid off and were making an additional $50 million in cuts to the budget," said Rep. Steve Brunk, R-Wichita. "Our goal is to enact a long-term stable and predictable revenue source to provide necessary services while protecting taxpayers pocketbooks. This bill accomplishes that.  Though dozens of Republicans ended up voting to raises taxes -- some in violation of anti-tax pledges -- some couldn't hide their displeasure.  Rep. John Whitmer, a Wichita Republican, spoke through tears as he explained his "yes" vote.  "I voted for something I am not proud of," Whitmer said, "but I feel it's what the folks need."  The legislation retained a business tax exemption Brownback delivered to 330,000 businesses in 2012, but raised the statewide sales tax to 6.5 percent from 6.15 percent on all purchases. A provision dropping the sales tax on food to 5.95  percent was withdrawn by Republicans who want to consider that adjustment in advance of the 2016 elections for House and Senate.  "It gives us the highest sales tax rate on food in the nation. Low-income people will be paying the highest rate in the nation," said Senate Minority Leader Anthony Hensley, D-Topeka. "Brownback's tax policy is Robin Hood in reverse. He steals from the poor to benefit the rich."  House Minority Leader Tom Burroughs, D-Kansas City, said Republicans were dedicated to adding $164 million to the sales tax, wiping out $97 million in itemized deductions and boosting the cigarette tax by $40 million.  "We are literally increasing the cost of living in Kansas on those who can afford it least," Burroughs said.  The plan would freeze state income tax rates at 2.7 percent and 4.6 percent through 2017, which saves the state $26  million. The deal also dropped language requiring all Kansas sales tax exemptions to expire in four years.  The session has consumed 113 days -- longest in state history and well beyond the standard 90-day session.  The break in House gridlock followed warnings by the Brownback administration that savage cuts would be made in the state university system and the state's bond ratings would collapse absent a compromise about Republicans.  Brownback and the GOP-controlled House and Senate struggled to respond to a budget deficit that trailed approval of the elimination of state income tax on limited liability companies and other businesses as well as the reduction of individual income tax rates. The bill contains a $24 million hit on these business entities, but the presumption is savvy accountants could help most owners avoid the hit.  The higher sales tax would be implemented July 1, but businesses wouldn't be obligated to assess that rate for 30 days. That could clip the state for one month of the projected revenue increase from the sales tax by $13 million.  The legislation also depends on the Kansas Department of Revenue pulling in $30 million this fall with a tax amnesty program for people who have dodge taxes.  The two bills now in play with the House and Senate would raise $384.6 million annually for the state, but a separate piece of legislation sent to Brownback would deliver $47.8 million from a new tax on managed care organizations in Kansas.
My English teacher during my senior year of high school was one of the coolest people I've known. He was open to ideas and encouraged creativity, no matter how crazy it might have seemed.   He only had one flaw, he would return papers weeks, if not even months, after they had been turned in. We wrote a long paper at the beginning of the second semester (January/February) and did not get them back until the night of graduation.  Ran in to him at a party a few years back. He had moved to the same college town to get his Masters. Found out that the reason it took him so long to return papers and have everything graded was due to the fact he had severe depression and teaching was the only thing that kept him going.  He's now married and has a wonderful life doing what he loves.

My first picture of the Moon using my Father-in-law's telescope! (Telescope + Nexus 5)
Looking at the cats eyes and how she digs her claws into the carpet, it's a clear sign she's terrified and trying to protect her kitten and not acting cute.   Is it worth an 'aww'? Perhaps...but I still feel sorry for the cat.
When dealing with blush, I either can't see it or it's too overpowering. Can't seem to find a brand that compliments my skin tone.   Eyeshadow is quite a bit different. As you can see, I have scaring above my left eye. More so, my entire eyelid consists of a skin graft. This makes applying eye makeup to be quite a challenge. Especially when I want to do something colorful and creative. Sorry, I should have made that problem more clear from the start.
My story:   I was hit by a car when I was a child (3 years of age - 1989 to give you a better idea of the time). Following the accident, I was both mentally and physically impaired. Both of which were apparent to the average person. As so I sought help via plastic surgery (and education...but that's another story). That is a lot to go through as a child and I am doing whatever possible to not seek help from that 'source of perfection'.   That is why I am here.   As you can see, I am rather pale, must draw on eyebrows, and the like, on a daily basis. No matter what I do, I cannot retain much color to my face. Over the past few months, I have experimented with different eye shadows and blush, but nothing seems to work. Also considered changing my hair color, but brown eyes make pairing quite a challenge. (i.e. I LOVE the woman's hair in the Wendy's commercials, but she also has blue eyes, so I'm not so sure if it would work.)   If you have any advice, please feel free to share!   Edit: I've tried darks and lights (hair color) but never seem to know what to do with my overall makeup. Even tried dirty-blonde-streaks back in high school, and to be honest, it looked ridiculous. I also knew very little about makeup, so that's possibly a reason.  Edit 2: Do not fret! I am currently reading through posts and seeing what I can do! This will surely require taking a trip to the mall, but I will use your tips, and fill everyone in on what works! Thank You so much, again! I truly appreciate it! :-)
Thank you so much for sharing! I will definitely try it sometime soon! Do you happen to know of a good recipe? If not, that's fine. Just thought I'd ask before searching! :-)
Recipe can be found here (though I used a cookbook - this is just easier to share):  http://www.food.com/recipe/red-chile-enchiladas-with-cheese-and-vegetables-52593
I know it crossed my mind a time or two, but I rarely took it in to consideration. After meeting Dan Barker a few years back, I began to realize just how much of a problem this was. First off, we (the US) are not solely a 'Christian Nation' and symbolizing such a thing on US Currency only provides more problems. I'm not sure where to go from there because that should make it rather clear, but I would like to point out the fact that (former motto) 'E pluribus unum': One out of many - seemed just fine.
See now, this makes us all look bad. Though I typically never admit to living/being from 'that state'.  Also, it snowed in southern Kansas and around the Wichita metropolitan area. I only know that b/c people won't shut up about it on Facebook. Ermahgerd it's snowing - in February - in Kansas!
I grew up in the 'middle-of-fing-nowhere KS' so I did the same. After a microburst blew through here a few years back, the thought of doing so (again) scares the cr@p out of me!   I know the sound of silence, that accompanies these sort of storms and yeah, I'll pass on purposely seeing one/ hearing one again. (No hating against storm-spotters, amazed at what they do)
