I'm not sure actually...I just noticed this while playing through the campaign...there are so many games where I end a chapter or mission in the middle of it and then when I come back to it...sometimes i forgot what happened in the last chapter lol... but to answer your question...maybe??? :-P ...I did just notice that when exiting a chapter in the middle of it instead of the beginning...lets say after you have completed one fight...when I played it again instead of getting the same fighter ...I ended up having a different opponent.
