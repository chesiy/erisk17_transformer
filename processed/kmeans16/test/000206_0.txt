It's okay. *I* got your reference.
Exactly, people are like, "I can't believe no one realizes this is a joke!" but the thing is, despite the fact that it's supposed to be a joke/parody/satire, it's a really bad short. Mediocre at best. The reason some people don't see it as parody or satire is because it does such a horrendous job of portraying that.  Despite the creator's intentions, it honestly looks more like a failed attempt to make an "adult" Power Rangers than an attempt to satire "gritty" action movies.
I also find it frustrating when people just refuse to believe he has any talent. They just go, "Michael Bay? Total shit director." He's actually a damn fine director. The man can direct action like no other. Despite whatever opinions people have on the artistic value of Bad Boys II, I still think it's one of the best action movies from a directing standpoint.
The thing is though, is that I don't want to know if it's made up. In fact, I kind of just don't care if it's made up or true. If I leave, I'd rather it be because it's not right for me because of the way I live. I don't want to learn it's made up *because* my loved ones believe it. I wouldn't want to know it to be false and have my family believe it to be true at the same time. That would make things harder for me deal with. I've never been the kind of person to create friction. I wouldn't want *them* to start questioning it as well, because they're happy believing it.   I've thought about my future constantly from both sides. How would it be if I wasn't Mormon? How would it be if I was? I can honestly see myself happy in both scenarios. But I can also see myself being unhappy in both as well. So I just take it day by day and have just decided to go with it. Let fate push and pull me where it must.  The way I see it, I'm happy with how I'm living now. I've found some weird equilibrium and for now, I'm okay with it.   By the way, I wanted to ask you something. I was afraid to ask earlier because I was afraid you would think I was being snarky, but now that things are diffused, What's with your username? If you don't believe, then why that username?
Really not seeing the problem here. It's not like people will go over to each other's houses. People would be meeting at a theater which is a public place that is most likely to have a large crowd. Especially on a weekend. They'd also be driving separate cars. Honestly, this is no different from a simple reddit meetup. People do it all the time. I make short films and have used reddit to find and meet with local actors and crew members. This honestly is not rapey at all.
The 3 kinds of comments in this post:  "Fuck Gamestop" Yeah yeah we've heard it all before.   "This is why I pirate games. Because I'm sending a message to the man!" No it's not. You pirate because you'd rather get something for free.   And finally, "This should be in the game. I bet it was but they just took it out." You should not be surprised and should expect this by now. I'm with you in that it sucks, but this is normal now. In fact it's weird if games don't have preorder bonuses now.
I can't speak for everyone, but what made it great for me was the theme of fathers and sons. I have a close relationship with my father and this movie really got to me emotionally. I also really loved the fact that it felt like a Greek tragedy play with its clear three act structure. I can totally see people not liking it though. I thought the reveal of what happens to Gosling's character was a great twist I didn't see coming.   I don't know if it will be considered a classic, but it will always be one of my all time favorites.
Samsara. Quite possibly *the best* looking blu ray out there. Jaw droppingly gorgeous.  The Tree of Life is another stunning film. The creation of the universe scene *has* to be seen on blu ray.  No Country for Old Men is another great blu ray addition, as well as the 2009 Star Trek.  Only God Forgives was one of the most beautiful movies to come out last year. Absolutely stellar cinematography. The look and music of this film are enough to warrant a blind buy if you've never seen it.  The Matrix is a great one as well. Especially the Ultimate Matrix Collection box set that has 35 hours of bonus features. That alone makes it worth it even if the film itself doesn't look good, which it does in fact look great!  Immortals, while a not great movie, is beautiful. Now is that enough to warrant a buy? That's up for debate, but since you can get it for a cheap price, it's not a bad addition.  Fantastic Mr. Fox is a great addition! Especially now that it has a Criterion release. This is a very pretty film that looks stunning on blu ray.  Lastly, 300. This film has some of the most beautiful cinematography of the last decade. I find it to be a must own blu ray, but that's just me.
I'm alright. Could be better. Could be worse. I'm kind of just...jaded. School in the morning and work in the evening everyday. Ready for summer. I'm happier than I've been in the past. I used to be depressed because I wasn't in school, unemployed, and had no love life. Now I'm two thirds there, so I'm feeling better about myself. I'm trying to get in shape so my confidence will build. I'm going to need it to start dating.  I miss my friends. They all work and have school, and are dating or engaged to someone so I'm starting to feel a little lonely.  Good things are happening though. This summer I'm starting work on my first feature film, so I'm really excited about that.  But all in all, I'm alright. A little stressed, but alright.
Well I don't really think it matters since really no one will see this post. It's been downvoted and because it's not one of the things I listed, even if it was positive, no one would upvote it because it has nothing to do with super heroes, posters, or any of the other stuff that always makes it to the front page.  So in the long run, it doesn't matter if this is what I call "dealing with it" because this post won't change a thing. For the record, I don't call this dealing with it. I call me being quiet about it for years "dealing with it". People complain about this sub all the time in the comments, but no one makes a post about it. Yeah, I went kind of harsh about it and was maybe overly sarcastic and passive-aggressive.  The way I see it, if this post was genuine and I really did love this sub and gave reasons why, I'd still get downvoted, no one would see it because, again, it's not related to super heroes or posters or whatever so it wouldn't make it to the front page, and the few people who would see it would just comment and tell me I was wrong and that it actually sucks.
Well I'm 7 days late but thought I'd still talk.  I'm in sort of the same situation. Filmmaker as well. However I do have at least one friend who I've been working with frequently. The problem is we are very different in our tastes and styles and he is unwilling to compromise, so we have started to hit walls when trying to come up with ideas.  I'm trying to broaden the amount of people to work with, but everyone else isn't as serious about it as I am. Everyone just wants to do it for fun, which is fine for them, but I want to make a career out of it whereas they have other careers in mind(doctor, lawyer, etc.,). So this leads to situations where I either have to work with my stubborn, uncompromising friend or work with people who goof off too much and don't care.  Too bad you and I don't live near each other(as far as I know. I'm assuming.). We seem to share the same interest.
That's still hoping for a lot. I loved Her but hype is a powerful thing. As much as I want Her to win, I wouldn't be surprised if it lost. I hope I'm wrong.
Fall/winter I have this old Plugg jacket from 8th grade. Still fits and looks great. It's olive green and has a nice taper in the sleeves and waist. I've had it for close to 10 years. Very very durable. It's been through a lot.   In the spring/summer it's black basketball shorts. That's what I wear *all* the time when it's hot. Not really fashionable, I know, but because they are solid black they look decent for these hot summers my city's known for.
I got five stars and went to Trevor's airstrip and got into a plane because it seemed like the only possible way to escape. It was a HUGE ordeal getting in the air. But once in the air I thought I was home free. Nope. Helicopters kept spawning in front of me. Gave up trying to lose them and just flew into a building and died. I'm not giving them the satisfaction of killing me.   Someone summed up the cops in GTA V perfectly. "The cops in GTA V would murder their families if it meant killing you."
[TOMT] [Song] Looking for a song with a strange beat and rhythm.   I heard a song at work today and loved the beat and rhythm of it, but don't know what it is. I know it's fairly recent because we only pay recent music, but not top forty stuff. I've never heard this song anywhere else before. I know one lyric, "I'll love you until the end of time." Or something like that. It's a pop song with a sort of middle eastern beat/rhythm to it however the singer sounds American. I know that at the end of the song he says, "Until theee eeeeennnndddd ooooof tiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiime."  The song has a pretty chill sound to it. It's not a slow love song. Definitely more of a pop song.  I know this isn't a lot to go on, but it's all I got.   Edit: New details: Most likely male singer. Also I should clarify what I mean by recent. What I mean by recent is like this year.
What are some good movies to show to a group of people from the ages of 18-23?   So me and some friends are doing a movie night Friday and I'm trying to figure out what to show.   A little info on my friends. They don't like slow paced movies and would rather not watch a drama unless its interesting and has good pace. They like just about any genre but would prefer either a horror, comedy, action or any combination of those. I think above all though the thing that matters most is if its interesting and has good pacing. I don't want to bore them. I showed them There Will Be Blood once and I could feel the awkward boredom in the room.   Also I'd prefer something that didn't come out in the last two years. Thanks guys!
