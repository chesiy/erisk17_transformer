Relevant text:   In 1989 the company produced a limited edition of beer (known in Sumerian as sikaru) which they named Ninkasi after the Sumerian goddess of beer. It was based on a scholarly reconstruction of an ancient Sumerian recipe known as the "hymn to Ninkasi". The recipe started with a twice-baked bread known as bappir as well as malt, and was sweetened with honey and dates. It did not include hops or other bittering ingredients, so it was considerably sweeter than modern beers. The recipe is described by Charlie Papazian. Also in 1989, the brewing process for a batch of Steam was interrupted during the Loma Prieta earthquake. The resulting (altered) brew was released as normal Anchor Steam, but with an inverted label; this beer has come to be referred to as Earthquake Beer.

Relevant text:  In 1993, Jack in the Box suffered a major corporate crisis involving E. coli O157:H7 bacteria. Four children died of hemolytic uremic syndrome and 600 others were reported sick after eating undercooked patties contaminated with fecal material containing the bacteria at a location in Tacoma, Washington and other parts of the Pacific Northwest. The chain was faced with several lawsuits, each of which was quickly settled (but left the chain nearly bankrupt and losing customers). At the time, Washington state law required that hamburgers be cooked to an internal temperature of at least 155 F (68 C), the temperature necessary to kill E. coli bacteria, although the FDA requirement at that time was only 140 F (60 C), which was the temperature Jack in the Box cooked. After the incident, Jack in the Box mandated that in all nationwide locations, their hamburgers be cooked to at least 155 F (68 C). Additionally, all meat products produced in the United States are required to comply with HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points) regulations. Every company that produces meat products is required to have a HACCP plan that is followed continuously. Jack in the Box also worked with food safety experts from manufacturing companies and created a comprehensive program to test for bacteria in every food product.
I said it was a repost before I did the search  You've been here for two months.  The "repost" you found was from two years ago.  and it's common knowledge  According to who?  Don't be mad at me because you post old shit.  I don't get mad at unknown internet users.  Nor did I post this.    I don't care if it's new to you, it's old as fuck.   This probably isn't the subreddit for you then.  Try /r/news.
No I don't.  They are two completely different topics.  I'm not sure what world you live in, but not everything is exactly the same.  If that's your stretch for what you're talking about, you're well off base.  Granted, you had a hard enough time just getting to the damn point and tried to tap dance around it so I shouldn't be surprised.
Relevant text:   While Sega was seeking a flagship series to compete with Nintendo's Mario series with a character to replace Alex Kidd as the company's mascot, several character designs were submitted by its Sega AM8 research and development department. Many results came forth from their experiments with character design, including an armadillo (who was later developed into Mighty the Armadillo), a dog, a Theodore Roosevelt look-alike in pajamas (who would later be the basis of Dr. Robotnik/Eggman's design), and a rabbit (who would use its extendable ears to collect objects, an aspect later incorporated in Ristar).  Eventually, Naoto Ohshima's spiky teal hedgehog, initially codenamed "Mr. Needlemouse",was chosen as the new mascot. Sonic's blue pigmentation was chosen to match Sega's cobalt blue logo, and his shoes evolved from a design inspired by Michael Jackson's boots with the addition of the color red, which was inspired by both Santa Claus and the contrast of those colors on Jackson's 1987 album Bad; his personality was based on Bill Clinton's "Get it done" attitude.

You didn't read it very closely then.   Still waiting for you to show me his **goal** was positive tension.  The man's legacy has been whitewashed. He might have been a pacifist, but he was also no pushover who went around demonizing rioters like so many conservative pundits keep assuming he did. You can go on google and find plenty of quotes from him (especially towards the end of his life) defending the actions of looters during the detroit riots or property destruction.  He was a christian and thought being non-violent was gods way. But that doesn't mean he lacked understanding.  I might add that MLK was far from some sort of holy prophet who's alter we must bow before.   Yet, you want to quote MLK yourself.  Amazing how you dismiss something he said when it doesn't fit your ideals.  Nobody ever gained liberation by asking politely. Nobody. There is no dialogue, because at the end of the day the powerful have no reason to listen. The oppressed are not meant to grovel before their oppressors for freedom, because they won't get it.   You didn't answer the question.
Continual avoidance of the question only serves to answer it for you already.  You're answer is **no** but you don't want to actually state it because then you reveal yourself to be a hypocrite.  Oh... FYI, The SC Legislature just agreed to take up a debate on the subject of removing the Confederate Flag from the Statehouse grounds.  Yes.  I know.  That story has already been posted a few times now in /r/news and I already commented on it.  At the outset, I think it's a joke to have a vote to discuss something to then have another vote.  Just do it already.  However, this is a symbolic vote in my opinion and once things cool down after a few weeks, I don't believe it'll change.  It's the typical politician "kick the can down the road until people forget and we can move on" ploy that we see all the time as it is.
because all conversation in the comments MUST follow the topic of the title. There CANNOT be any side discussion.   Yet you're getting spun up claiming that **I** derailed the topic.  Now you're defending it.  Make up your mind pal.  Two or three news stations running a story EQUALS the whole country being thoroughly informed.  Two or three news stations cancels out your claims that the media made no peep of it.  Additionally, if you think those few, to include the #1 circulated newspaper in the country were the only ones, you're deluding yourself.  As I previously stated, I grabbed the first five I saw on the first page of a Google search.  Anyone that had 5 Hour Energy in the last 5 years and never heard of this should feel quite betrayed, by the media, stores, and FDA;  Uh, yeah, OK.  Oversensitive much?  fuck off troll  What?  No facts to support your claims?  Eh, I guess when not only I, but you yourself show your claims to be B.S., I guess this is what you resort too.  Toodles.

Relevant text:  Female spotted hyenas have a clitoris 90 percent as long and the same diameter as a male penis (171 millimeters long and 22 millimeters in diameter), and this pseudo-penis's formation seems largely androgen-independent because it appears in the female fetus before differentiation of the fetal ovary and adrenal gland. The spotted hyenas have a highly erectile clitoris, complete with a false scrotum, and "the resemblance to male genitalia is so close that sex can be determined with confidence only by palpation of the scrotum". The pseudo-penis can also be distinguished from the males' genitalia by its greater thickness and more rounded glans. The female possesses no external vagina, as the labia are fused to form a pseudo-scrotum. In the females, this scrotum consists of soft adipose tissue. Like male spotted hyenas with regard to their penises, the female spotted hyenas have small penile spines "on the glans, or head, of [their clitorises], making the clitoris tip feel like soft sandpaper". The clitoris "extends away from the body in a sleek and slender arc, measuring, on average, over 17 cm from root to tip. Just like a penis, [it] is fully erectile, raising its head in hyena greeting ceremonies, social displays, games of rough and tumble or when sniffing out peers".
Around the ages of 4/5, my son would stutter.  It seemed like his mind was five steps ahead of where his mouth was.  I'd just tell him to relax and take his time as there was no hurry and he grew out of it within 1-1 1/2 years.  When my ex and a few others would push him to "say what you want to say" he'd just get frustrated and say that he "forgot" what he wanted to say and that was that.  Pissed me off to no end.  If you do have a kid that does that, just be patient with them and they'll be fine.

This is the type of crap that gets to me.  Should the 2003 invasion of Iraq happened?  Not at all (in my opinion).  With that said, it did happen.  We can't go back in time and change it.  So what the hell is even the point of the question asked of him?  I want to hear his plans/goals for the future.  Things that can be affected by his decisions.  Not something that happened over a decade ago.
Well, they don't go anywhere.  Being that you'll be able to run up to it pretty quick, what the hell then?
I downvoted you  [OK](http://i.giphy.com/hLUiXoGKNIVb2.gif)  Are you implying also that if Bernie Sanders was even more left-wing, that he'd actually stand a snowball's chance in the Democrat primaries?  I'm not implying anything.  I'm stating that Jeb Bush, who apparently trails most of the Republican field in Iowa, is not at the level of blowhard crazy that some of the others are at.  If you can't discuss the topic/article at hand, best to stay out of the thread.  Or are you saying that the left-wing base is educated and enlightened while the conservative base is "blowhard crazy"  I'm saying what I said at the outset.  *He's not at the level of blowhard crazy that some of the others are at.*  I'm discussing Jeb Bush and the other candidates in the Republican field.  What exactly are you talking about?
then people would actually read a tiny percent more about politics and make more of an informed decision  One can dream...........  My original post was sarcasm.  Too many people I've met have no idea exactly who they are voting for (meaning what the person stands for) and just vote for a party.
As someone who frequently gets stopped while walking because "someone" reported some minor unprovable crime or "suspicious activity" I have my doubts in this case. It's one of the most common go-to reasons police use for a bullshit stop to provide reasonable suspicion.   Why would you doubt someone calling about you?  It's one of the most common go-to reasons police use for a bullshit stop to provide reasonable suspicion.   Source?  considering how often police have been proven to lie lately  You need to step away from the media machine.  Take into consideration the number of police officers there are in this country, the number of interactions each may have every single day, and then compare to the number of instances that actually get blown up.  Too many people are drinking the media kool-aid.
So about those week long peaceful protets that were happening and noone paid any attention or could of gave a fuck. What did those do?  Well, you have [this](http://blackwestchester.com/2015/04/27/10000-peacefully-protest-bmore/):  *What they dont report was there were, Muslims, Christians, Jews, Blacks, Whites, Asians, Young and Old, Rich and Poor people all united and standing harmoniously against common oppression, shared one of the organizers Frank Sha Francois. The demonstration was sponsored by a wide coalition of social justice groups, including Malik Shabazz of Black Lawyers For Justice (BLFJ), Carl Dix of Stop Mass Incarceration (SMIN) and brother Ted Freedomfighter Sutton of Sutton House, just to name a few who came in support of their brothers and sisters in Baltimore. Support for justice of Freddie Gray, 25, who was arrested one week ago, in West Baltimore. Who died on April 19th, from injuries sustained while he was in police custody.*  Here's what that does.  It shows a united front of all different types of people.  It shows that people want something done and they are willing to be civilized human beings, sit and discuss the problem, figure out a solution, and fix the problem.   The police are not innocent people  Pretty broad brush stroke there no?  Are there bad cops?  Absolutely.  Are they in the minority.  Yep.  If we want to paint broad brush strokes, would you then agree that "black people are criminals" based on a small percentage that are acting out violently and criminally?  they need to be brought to justice and held accountable  The ones that abuse their power?  Absolutely.  it will not happen thru peaceful means.  Yet it's been proven time and time again that it does.  What do violent/criminal acts do?  They give the city a reason to increase the number of police officers on the street and hire more.  It creates and/or strengthens a stereotype that then turns into bias/profiling.  HAHAH fuck off with the mlk thing  Yeah, because that would go against your agenda and proves you wrong.   like things havent changed since 9/11 that make peaceful resistance useless  You're right.  Things have changed.  Such as, this country is far less racially divided than it was during the time of MLK.  **HE** was able to bring change, peacefully, in a far more hostile environment.  The environment is nowhere near as hostile today, yet people cannot impact change peacefully?  This just sounds like sheer laziness.  Boohoo other people lives are being disrupted while others fight for their fucking lives  If that's the attitude you want to give, then expect the same attitude in return.    It's time to stop using the race card and playing victim.  People want to blame others for their situation instead of pulling their own shit together and taking personal responsibility.  You don't want the cops bothering you?  Then don't give them a reason too.  You want to succeed in life?  Then work for it.  Harming other people's lives, ruining their livelihood, creating destruction, and not acting like a civilized human being has never caused progress.
