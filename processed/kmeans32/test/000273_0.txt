Anybody know what day it is?
Yeah, it is actually.  Edit: Made this myself. It's from S02E22 @ 11m45s.
Banana for scale?
Hands down, most appropriate comment in this thread! You should look yourself in the mirror every night and ask yourself, "Did I treat people the way I would like to be treated?" If the answer is "no", then ask yourself, "What can I do differently tomorrow?"  **May I have the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,**  **The courage to change the things I can,**  **And the wisdom to know the difference.**  Edit: *my little secret*
Not only was "the drunk guy" move flawless, but the "fakie one-footed nose-dive to caddy-pass to caddy 720-flip to crosswalk" move was history in the making!

It's a great publicity stunt, at best... It seems as though we are living in the "Age of Awareness", where all of the injustices can be talked about endlessly with little recourse. We have unfortunately sacrificed all of our "power of the people" for a false sense of security and are no longer able to legitimately fight for our rights. Wikimedia, as everyone should know by now, has an unbelievably legitimate argument, but will get nowhere beyond awareness.
Toasters be tripping!

I can tell just by the way you type that you have a sexy voice... And I don't need to call her, we are both sitting here high as shit on some painkillers!
As a father of three children, I am becoming increasingly more concerned with the role that money plays in our lives. It is sad that I sit hear and think to myself, *This is not news anymore, it is so commonplace to hear about these things. It would be bigger news hearing about people that are outing the rich fucks that are bribing people*
Dude, you should see a Doctor!
Not at all, fine motor skills aid in the growth of intelligence... advancement in mathematics has been shown to be directly correlated to the development of manual dexterity.

Thank you for your wonderful insight kind commenter... I actually have three young children and I raise them in a way, that I believe, is appropriate. Which means that I am not feeding my children excessive amounts of food, dressing them up like inanimate dolls, and exploiting them on television for profit. This post depicts a natural disaster, IMO, of parents like hers not needing to raise children for so many obvious reasons, they cannot all be described in this comment, or better yet, an essay. I'm glad that you have a natural right in this world to express your views of opposition.  If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear." -George Orwell
As a recovering drug-addict (sober 4yrs1mo16day)... That is some really good talk you hear all the time in meetings!  "If you have one foot in the past and one foot in the future, you are pissing all over the present."  "It's called the present for a reason, because it is a gift."
Hell yeah! If he can get his life back together, nothing will stop him from getting those nudes!
MRW someone attempts to pronounce my difficult, eternally butchered, last name out loud in a public place... AND NAILS IT!

Bad Luck Brian my ass! That is dumb as fuck [Insert Alliterative Name Here]!
Tried to post in /r/gaming but it wouldn't show up and mods never replied to my message...  So I was cleaning the floors in our bedroom and pulling all of the shit out from under our bed and I find these beauties in a box covered in dust. Now, I've never been much of a gamer, but I loved these two systems! The Game Boy Color still works, however, the screen on the Game Gear is not working. I can hear sound and barely see an image if I hold screen at an angle. Can it be repaired cheaply and easily?  Also (sorry).... What is this? Can I connect the Game Gear to my TV or monitor? http://imgur.com/JVbpcDu
