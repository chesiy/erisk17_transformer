You've probably heard of Inception You might have heard of Super 8 You probably haven't heard of The war game You've never heard of The Face of Another
Really great post. Thanks for the explanation man.
This is probably going to be the best movie of the year.
Amazing.
Heaven knows what he is gonna do..
Hell yeah!!
Pixar is at it again....
It will surely gross more than 1 billion dollars.
The scene were Matthew Mcconaughey finds out solution and gives clue to Jessica is just too good.
Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman in The Prestige.
Why these two? Their previous scripts aren't good.
What? Shrek 2 was great. Really funny movie.

"Ohh... I am not gonna kill you .......I am just gonna hurt you..really..really bad!"
I think Pierce Brosnan is the best bond ever.
'The Theory of Everything' was good too.
(and) Gravity(2013), Source Code(2011), Cloud Atlas(2012)
Great news.Loved the movie. I think its the best movie of Tim Burton.
Damn that was a good holiday.
My niece was born this year and she was named Elsa.
You're right. Ratatouille's screenplay is easily the best among the Pixar franchise.
Everyone forgot E.T:The Extra Terrestrial (1982) I would also like to add Driving Miss Daisy (1989) Ordinary People (1980) Rain Man (1988) The Breakfast Club (1985) National Lampoon's Vacation (1983)
Totally agree with you on that.

After watching Part-1 my ideas on crime movies were never the same again.And no other crime movie can compete with it either.
I watched the movie after reading Emma's praise about the story.But i was really disappointed with the movie.A total disaster and waste of time.
Nah.Diesel is not a sword guy.He's all muscle.Looking forward to it.
Good film.Unique and excellent screenplay.Jake and Tony did a great job.
