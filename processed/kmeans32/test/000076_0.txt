Researchers identify rat brain cells that track speed
Because sounds, visible markings, gestures, and a few other things can all be used to achieve symbolic communication, and in this case, a written symbol stands for a sound (which both birds and humans use.)  There are interesting analogies between many seemingly unrelated areas, including between animal communication and DNA, as the original commenter alludes to.
Poor reporting.  There are multiple studies already published that used RFID tags for bees, as well as other insects.  To list just a few:  http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0030023  http://www.mdpi.com/2075-4450/5/3/513/htm  http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13592-012-0156-7  Not to mention years of studies that used other types of transmitters, including radar transponders that actually track complete flight paths of bees.

Use of Temporary Names for Newborns Increases Risk of Medical Mistakes
i agree with your general message here, but I wouldn't say it's "barely a study."  It's a meta-analysis of 61 other studies.  There are some drawbacks to combining data from studies done at different times and on different populations, but it also gives you a lot more data to work with, so that it's easier to see broad patterns.
"Clearly most smokers do not develop schizophrenia, but the researchers believe it is increasing the risk.  The overall incidence of the condition is one in every 100 people normally, which may be increased to two per 100 by smoking."  This is a much better representation of the findings than the title used here.

Team IDs New Virus with Apparent Ties to Deadly Encephalitis Cases in Imported Squirrel Reservoir
Thanks for pointing this out, this was a huge oversight in the headline writing.  The researchers in this study showed that the most commonly used antidepressant, along with several others, were not associated with increased risk of birth defects in their study.

I think Dirk Gently is fantastic, and I've never heard of Last Chance to See!  I'm excited to go find it now.

Thanks for taking the time to answer!  Unfortunately, this is not quite what I was looking for.  I'm aware of the chemical complexity of odors, but for this activity I'd like to relate the subjective properties of  floral scents to the type of pollinator that each plant is adapted to attract (e.g. flowers that are pollinated by bees often have scents that a human would identify as moderate, floral and pleasant, while some fly-pollinated flowers have pungent, foul odors.)
"When you try to climb a mountain to prove how big you are, you almost never make it. And even if you do it's a hollow victory. In order to sustain the victory you have to prove yourself again and again in some other way, and again and again and again, driven forever to fill a false image, haunted by the fear that the image is not true and someone will find out. That's never the way." *Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance*

This is a really complex task; we are still in the process of learning what functions proteins perform, what genes code for those proteins, how variations in gene sequence and other DNA sequence affect gene expression and protein function, etc.  However, this is something that forensic scientists, geneticists, and others have been working on in humans and a few other animals, with some success: http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22129613.600-genetic-mugshot-recreates-faces-from-nothing-but-dna.html#.VZMA8kZdq2U  In agricultural research, researchers are also working on predicting certain traits of interest from DNA sequence alone, such as milk production in cows, yield or stress tolerance in crop plants, etc.   Adding a bit of specificity after checking my facts.  Right now for humans, we can predict skin tone pretty well, and a few other traits with some accuracy (hair and eye color, hair texture, height, facial structure as above) but far from perfectly. As I said above, these areas are actively improving.  Reference: "Forensic DNA Phenotyping: Predicting human appearance from crime scene material for investigative purposes."  So, right now, probably not for most organisms, or sort of for humans.  In the future (10-20 years) probably much better, at least for humans and organisms "of interest".
That is the most fun sounding strength training I've ever heard of.
Despite impaired learning and memory, aged fruit flies forage faster than young flies
It might be a little harder with no affiliation.  Knowledge and ideas are always good currency in academia, though.  Enthusiasm alone might not be enough, but knowledgeable enthusiasm has a much better shot.  For the PIs you've identified, look up their prior published work on their websites or at the library, wherever you need to go to get access.  Read it and think about it.  Read some related work, or relate their work to what you already know from your undergraduate courses.  When you contact them, write a succinct first letter and not a show-offy one, but use your reading to articulate to them why you find their work interesting, and how you see your own intellectual interests and goals fitting with it.  If you have any good connections to faculty from your undergraduate institution, and still feel comfortable contacting them for advice, it might be worth letting them know of your current interests and what schools/PIs you are considering.  Even if they are in a different field, they might have some social connection to one or more of the people you're considering.  They might be able to give guidance on how to get in touch with those people.
I am right there with you my friend.  Good reminder to me to go do leg raises and clamshells and weep softly to myself.
Fair point, I have not.  Briefly stated, my issue with ASOIAF (I actually read all the books so far, in a really over the top attempt to give them a fair shake and understand why my BF likes them) is not the violence per se, although I know this is the issue for many who dislike them.  It's that although the plot is exciting and full of cliff-hangers, I just don't get the sense of a lot of thought or meaning behind them.  No genuine reflection on human nature, philosophy, or the way the world works.  If characters die, it shouldn't be as a "gotcha" at the reader.  If a despicable character suddenly shows a more empathetic side, it should feel genuine, not like a plot twist for the sake of surprise.  This might be unfair to Martin, it's just my subjective experience.  Are his short stories substantially different in style?  If it's just that novel-writing or sudden mega-fame changed his writing a lot, I'd be interested to give them a shot just for the heck of it.
I'm not trying to say it isn't exciting, just that its novelty and interpretation are being overstated.  The resource I cite is one of many that have established in vivo imaging of dendritic spines.  This research has improved ability to image deeper brain structures repeatedly in vivo, but they are building on a lot of previous work, including the study I cited.  It's a great improvement, but not a revolution.  The hippocampus is important, but it's the "golden child" for a lot of researchers, in a way that leads to unrealistic models of how the brain works.  To say that it's "particularly" important compared to the cortex sounds biased to me.  The cortex is hugely important.  So are primary sensory processing centers.  To make kind of a quibbling argument, for example, you wouldn't have a lot of auditory memory without ears, no matter how healthy your hippocampus is.  Again, this work is important.  It just doesn't prove for the first time that synapses store memories, and it's being discussed (and portrayed as surprising) in the context of a biased way of viewing the brain.
"Done because we are too meny"
But doesn't gravitational pull also depend on distance?  You could get closer to the center of mass of the crumpled orange, so in that subset of cases wouldn't the gravitational pull of that orange be stronger? This is assuming OP meant the crumpled orange is collapsed inward, since the crumpled one is "more dense".  Also, I wonder how you get a hollow orange.
The exact mortality rate varies by species, geographical location, and time, but in every species I know of, there is some mortality risk during hibernation, due to predation, disease, starvation, etc.  As a counterpoint to bats, apparently black bears have a really low mortality rate during hibernation, ~1%.  (Seems like that would actually be lower than their mortality rate during the summer!)  ETA:  1. Wow, I did not expect so much enthusiasm for bears!  2. Although it apparently has been a topic of controversy, there does seem to be scientific consensus that bears hibernate: https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Hibernation#Bears https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en q=bear+AND+hibernation btnG= as_sdt=1%2C14 as_sdtp= http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3atd68/how_common_is_it_for_animals_to_die_during/csfwpvo

An alternative to drug-sniffing dogs: Honey bees can be trained to detect pure heroin
Maybe this is a bit of a cheating answer, but any "tragedy of the commons" scenario (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons) kind of fits.  In humans, I'm not sure one could identify a single trait that drives this type of behavior, but selfishness, and the inappropriate bias toward considering short-term vs. long-term outcomes both play a role.  In other species, even the simple drive toward reproduction can do this; if individuals are all exploiting a resource-rich environment and reproducing at a rate optimal for themselves, they can overpopulate the environment and crash.
In theory, and in a very simplistic way, yes; supporting the life of the most important pollinating bees would contribute to more efficient pollination of crops (assuming that one was focusing on the right species in the right geographical regions, close enough to where crops are grown, etc.)  In practice, there are two major points.  One is that none of these bees are honey bees, Apis mellifera, the type of bee that most people imagine raising and maintaining.  For the purpose of the research done in this paper, honey bees were excluded because many of them are not "wild", and the researchers wanted to focus exclusively on wild bees.  Almost all of the species they looked at are not typically reared by humans, and none are "domesticated" to the extent that bees are.  Additionally, the majority of bee species in the world, and many examined in this research, are not "social," that is, they do not live in colonies.  They are solitary.  That doesn't really matter to answer your question, I am just too much of a nerd not to share!  If you are interested in supporting bee populations though, there are lots of ways to do that less directly, including protecting whatever parts of the environment specific types of bees live in, planting bee-friendly plants to ensure that they have season-long access to food (instead of having no food whenever local crops are not in bloom), etc.
