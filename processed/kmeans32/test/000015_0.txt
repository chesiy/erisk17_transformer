So basically titan fall then?
What build are you using here i'd love to try it out in some pvp matches, flaming axe is the spice of life!  edit: nvm figured it out 6/2/0/2/4
I've played guardian since the start as my main and mostly PvP don't care about pve, and I for one am excited I don't understand your disappointment.
Woah that kid looks like Brad Pitt
As a level 52 you're at a major disadvantage, yes you get boosted to 80 but your stats will not be as high as an actual level 80 with full gear, you really have no chance until you're level 80 yourself and have your gear and traits, just run with the zerg try and stay out of the way and toss some grenades in there, also if you're getting chased Rocket Boots, turn around Net shot then run for your life and don't forget to use Caltrops on toolkit to slow them down and your block as you run away (If you think they can still hit you).
Was this kid called spongebob?
Decent driving school in liverpool?   Finally looking to start learning how to drive, any one have any schools they can recommend, not sure of the reputations some have.
No, that's a tree
You've hit the nail on the head here i guess what it is that i'm most scared of was like you said the guy being better at this than i am, i feel like i would take that the wrong way and knock my confidence, it's not an easy decision to make, losing all control and allowing this to happen.  The part you explained about stepping back has really gave me a new perspective on how to look at it, thinking of it that way i don't get as angry as i would normally, i guess i picture myself in the point of view of the other guy and that's not the best thing to do.  I do need to work on my own insecurities and overthinking the situation and i think i can do it, you've helped me out more than you realise but i know i'm not going to change over night, but at least i have a new perspective to think about, thank you.
Source?
Yeah I always check things for myself would never ignore something simply because it was down voted and thank you I didn't mean to accuse you of accusing me hahah.
Thank you!
Another question for you guys just need a little help!   If the total charge on an ion of oxygen is -3.2 x 10^-19C, how many more electrons than protons does it have? Not sure how to work this one out.
Thank you I'll have to do a bit if reading about it see if it's something I'd be interested in
Thanks i'll have a look into some of your suggestions, also i'm in the UK so i don't think that codeacademy is much use to me here.
Thank you so much for sharing your experience, i'll show her this tomorrow and hopefully give her some peace of mind, i know it's going to be hard for her and i'm going to be there every step of the way with her, this is defenitly what we want we've spent alot of time thinking about it together, and yeah her family would go crazy if they knew about it and she doesn't need that extra stress, thank you again i'll show her this tomorrow (she doesn't use reddit) but she might PM you from my account if that's alright and again thank you so much!
