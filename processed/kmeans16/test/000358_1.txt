Kind of. Loved this dude to no end, then we broke up. And he straight up told me he doesn't like me as more than a friend anymore after about a year of us still having feelings after we broke up. Now he's talking to me less and less and obviously trying to get away from me and it breaks my heart because I can feel him slipping away and I can't handle that. As melodramatic as it sounds I've been flirting a lot with other guys lately, because I figure that if I give myself to guys that don't matter then I'll forget the only one that does. My friends hate him, his friends hate me. We fought a lot and at one point this summer he was being such a dick to me that I told him I was done and I wasn't gonna talk to him anymore. That lasted about a week. Then I smoked weed once in like, September after I promised him I wouldn't (he's really against drugs and alcohol), and then texted him high off my ass. Basically after a spell of us being really good with each other, I broke it and he said "I broke the best bond we've ever had with each other." Then he ran off and his friends found him at the smoke shop because "if she's gonna stoop that low then so am I." And nothing has been the same since then. I love this guy to no end, he's the only thing I ever think about, and he's pushing me away, and I think about it and it just makes my entire body hurt because I know it's completely over and won't happen again. Sorry for the wall of text, but I started typing and it felt good to let it out.
Well. The college admissions people for the school that I emailed (and really want to go to) we're rude as hell to me. My friend that I kinda have feelings for didn't text me back all day. My other friend who always asks for nudes and who I always say no to because I don't do that decided that he doesn't want to be my friend if I won't send him nudes. So, it was a day. But at least I aced my Spanish test. That was cool.
annamarie225 15/f  It's 2 am and I don't have anyone to talk to. I do marching band and frc and I like books and sleeping and animals. So. Please.
In all honesty as much as you guys are joking about it, I do think it was offensive and uncalled for.  EDIT: So I'm getting downvoted for thinking it's offensive to display the n-word in a public place. Uh, okay.
Yup, that sounds about right. It actually did make me cry at one point just because he's so innocent. Keep reading to the end, it's worth it.

I had zero interest in boys until fifth grade. Then it was a super tall redheaded boy with freckles and super green eyes. And he was really funny and could crack me up. Holy cow though my feelings were so strong at the time, probably because it was my first crush. But he's a douche now so lol oh well
I already have my heart set on Michigan Tech.  I think I have a pretty good chance if getting in, considering my decent GPA (3.67), and the fact that I'm in my school's robotics program and am going to an engineering camp there this summer.
[This](http://imgur.com/jTV436X) Was once a normal looking and intact big bird doll, but I took this thing literally EVERYWHERE from the time I was a baby until I was about 6. It means a lot to me because it's the one thing that sums up my time as a little kid because he went everywhere that I went, and all the paint chips and limbs being halfway torn off have little stories.
I am. Trombone in jazz and euph in concert and marching :3
annamarie225  plz
I've thought about this before. I would take a bus or a train to Chicago, and try to find a cheap apartment, and make a fake ID if I had to, and get a job wherever I could, and I could just live happily by myself.
Yup, that's it! Thank you!
Heh. I get it. I'm gonna message you now. Yeah.
Wow. Thank you. Really. I'll definitely try that. I guess that's all I need. Some time away, just to act a little reckless. Again, thank you bro. Really helpful. c:
This freaking song. Definitely my favorite on the album, kind of hard to listen to right now though because I just went through a rough breakup and he and I used to listen to this song together all the time.
