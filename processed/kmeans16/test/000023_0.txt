[REQUEST] I am looking for a particular creepy website   This came out BEFORE Warehouse 13. It was a website that people could submit content to. The format was that you were reading files on a secret asylum for dangerous supernatural objects and/or creatures. Each story was given a case number and some of them were terrifying. I seem to remember one of them was about a man sized doll like thing that always stood in the corner, but if the lights went off, or someone stopped watching the camera feed, it would move to a new location. (Pretty sure this is Pre-Weeping Angels) Any ideas? I've looked and looked and haven't come back across it. Thanks in advance for any help.
Yeah.
[Here is a picture from the 2 evenings after the initial photo when I was trying for a comparison](http://imgur.com/e1qyUHf) Also, the last part of your post rationalizing away everything with possible scenarios is...I don't even know what... The most made up part of this whole account is the stuff you threw in there. I told you no one was home except for me, my wife with long red hair, a tattooed man and his long haired, heavy set wife. We live in the middle of the country. We don't even have sidewalks. No kids were home. Also, the dog rolling in the yard wouldn't allow anyone to just randomly be there.
Glad you like it! I can't blame your brother for drinking that Ninkasi. Those are good. We bark together, my friend!
Thank you for doing the thing.  It sets us apart from the other subs, for sure.
As much as I would like to think he will come back all better, as someone who came off of rehab with a girlfriend still using, it broke us up. If it hadn't, I wouldn't have stayed sober. It was one of the hardest decisions of my life. Since his drugs of choice are alcohol and social media, it would seem like his GF isnt going to do him any favors, unfortunately.
I REALLY want to do this.  1: We Bark Together  2: Seattle  3: I cannot do international. I am a minister and my personal funds are way limited.  4: I am a vet of reddit secret santa, but I have not done Drafts for the Draft.  5: After getting really drawn into the craziness of the new Browns energy, I had to find a bigger community. Being a displaced Clevelander is hard. 10 years in ATL, and now I live (hopefully forever) outside of Seattle in the mountains. I am wearing a Browns shirt and orange shorts in San Fran in China Town as we speak.
[JERSEY QUESTION] I am about to buy the last of my Pre-2015 Jerseys and I'd like your help.   I am going to get one more jersey before we change to the new style. I already have a Seal Brown '40' that was given to me with "Hillis" scraped off and my name stenciled on as a gift (First Jersey) I then bought a Seal Brown Cribbs '16' and a Seal Brown Haden '23'. I pretty much know that I want a Thomas '73'. The question is, do I want to go Seal Brown again, or do I go with my first White Jersey?   I want the Seal Brown because I worry we wont have them next year, and I think I will still be able to get a white jersey next year. But I dont have a white jersey, yet, and I think Thomas might be really sick in White.   Suggestions?
As was pounded into the sub 2 seeks ago: Dont anyone say anything about these refs.   To quote what was said by /u/slapdog238 : "As a Browns fan who has lived all over the country, I can assure you, every. single. fanbase. thinks the very same thing. It's a copout. Our team is simply not playing well."
All I'm saying is: I get it. He pawned a ring. Now let's move on and get back to the rest of the library of songs by Sublime. All of which are amazing. It breaks my heart that there is a song that I dont like.
Johnny Manziel might not be a trouble maker, but trouble sure finds him. Cant wait till he's the starter and is still doing BS like this. This junk makes him look like a thuggish child. Who let's their crew beat the shit out of folks? Plaxico. Next thing he'll be shooting himself in the leg and wearing sweat pants to night clubs.
Let's do this one for the Gipper!   Browns.
I agree with you. I also have been a big fan of him as a pickup since the Draft. My prediction was that Hoyer would get bumped out for Manzeil, then around game 8 I see him getting creamed on a scramble, and then they bring in Shaw and he lights it up not only that game, but for the rest of the,  year. He starts in Johnny comes back at the beginning of '15, plays 2 games, they bring Shaw back, he takes us to the Super Bowl.
I was going through a friends artwork and found this. I thought /r/dragons would appreciate it :)
Im sure he picked him with the same "I like him. He's a good 'ol boy" mentality he keeps Romo around with. I can honestly think of no other reason he would hire him.
Would you like to share our stories about Invocation and letting deity work through us?   Someone mentioned: ["Until you started posting your blog here I wasn't really aware of how Eleusinian the Aquarian Tabernacle Church was."](http://www.reddit.com/r/Wicca/comments/1wo46e/searching_for_the_kore_by_regina_cagle/cf3uxx0), in an earlier post. LOL Sorry about the lack of context before I started posting. We just happen to be in the middle of rehearsals for Spring Mysteries Festival, so many of these posts are blogs of what each priest/ess is going through as they work with their God forms. It's a way for people to get to see the kind of transformations that occur within the people that hold these monumental energies. I have done invocation and psychodrama for 10 years, and the changes and growth that happen through the process of working these energies is really amazing sometimes. Like Anansi says when he shares a story: "This is my story as I have told it. If it be sweet, or if it be not sweet; take some with you, and let some come back to me". One of the things I was hoping to hear from people was their experiences holding energies in their own psychodramas and rituals. I'd love to hear stories from anyone who would like to share. :)
