I wonder what he thought when Kejri said "it'll be nice if Yogendra and Prashant return to the party."

I don't know what all the fuss is about. Modi's mother tongue is Gujarati and he has no issues with Hindi being promoted. People need to stop criticising just for the sake of criticism. I'm Punjabi and I think Hindi should be the language India should promote abroad. I mean, we can't promote all of our languages, gotta stick with one.
Jew probably did nazi that coming

9/11!   Would bang!
Probably not in the coming decade. Maybe after that.   But in a way it is good as we will be able to see how this plays out in countries like U.S and learn from their mistakes/exleriences after 10 years.
Although I am a BJP supporter and believe that Kejriwal will eventually end up like a Lalu or Mulayam (both had a lot of expectations from people like Kejri has since both were disciples of J.P but...after a decade or so they did not turn out to be what people expected) I do think that this hike in the education expenditure is good. If it is executed properly then it could be one of the best things that ever happened to Delhi.  Moreover the play grounds of Government  schools will be available to colony kids for playing after school hours so that'll be cool too. It's a small move, but was really needed.
Don't bother arguing with the pessimists.

Great places to live. I don't like those crazy winters though, my body is not used to it so moving there isn't something I might consider. But the people are good. Women are gorgeous. Education system is probably the best in the world in the Scandinavian countries, primarily Finland. We in India can certainly learn a lot from it.   Also since most people there can speak English it's easy to communicate with 'em.
Never fuck with a tea vendor
Also open borders and maybe sign a defence pact too

No, he just blows his nose over it. We all know who the Italian boot-lickers are. They've helped Antonia stay in power for a decade and still want more of her
