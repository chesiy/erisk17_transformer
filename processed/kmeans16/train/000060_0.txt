I'm not the one singling them out, they're doing that themselves.  How so? According to the [Clifton report](http://www.dogsbite.org/pdf/dog-attack-deaths-maimings-merritt-clifton-2014.pdf), the fatality rates for Akitas, German Shepherds, Huskies and Chows are likewise disproportionate. Citing the Wikipedia page on fatal dog attacks certainly indicates that fatalities from pit bulls are disproportionate to the breed's population but it doesn't disprove /u/nomecks's point that there are other breeds with a similar issue.
