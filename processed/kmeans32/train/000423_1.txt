Yeah, I'll think about that. Thanks again.
Thanks!
Bold lipstick that won't wipe off?   Hey there!  I am preparing my look for a musical I will be in soon, and I'm on the look out for a really solid lipstick/stain. Because I will be on stage, I need a very bright red. I also have an onstage kiss, so I'm searching for a product that will absolutely stay on my face and not his.  If you know of a good product, please let me know! Thanks so much. xoxo
I think the writers tried to show that he'd been considering it, but he found it best not to really let her in on the fact that he was considering it. I mean, he literally tells her while walking out the door. He didn't want to face her reaction and risk changing his mind.
Congratulations!! Also, you are very pretty!
Youth of Texas here. Please no. We deserve it, but don't leave me here.
Yes, that's correct.
Wow, thank you so much! I appreciate this a lot!
Please send this in. It's amazing.
Didn't even realize how far I was.   Quick post to remind you guys that **it does get easier**. I remember a time where I just didn't care and gave in thinking I could never do it, and here I am on day seventy and it's never been so easy. It eventually just becomes instilled in you to be clean. Are there temptations? Hell yes, but the difference is you determination in saying no.  Be strong, it is so worth it. Feel free to ask for advice or tips, if you like.
Thank you(:
Welcome, we're glad to have you! My advice is 1) Keep yourself busy. If you're too busy doing something, your mind doesn't have time to make you fall. If you're feeling the urge to relapse, take a walk, call up a friend, do *something*.  2) Your body will trick you. The reason that I have relapsed before is that when you get really turned on, your body will tell your brain that you don't want to get turned off, distracted, whatever. *But that is wrong.* Whenever you feel the tiniest urge and your body is telling you how nice it is, get busy or come here to NoFap.  3) This is more of a personal idea, but I don't think cold showers are very helpful. For some people they are, but to me, the last thing I want to do is get naked and alone. If it works for you, great, but it never worked out for me personally.  4) Post or read as much as possible. This journey is so much easier when you know someone out there is rooting for your success.  5) Your relapses suck, but they make you stronger in the end. If you fall, pick yourself up and vow to make your next streak longer. The worst thing you can do for yourself is accept your failure, but then *continue* to fail.   Well, hope you enjoyed that wall of text. Good luck! Best wishes!
I don't see how this is cringe worthy...
Two reasons that some may have. 1) Straight men think that looking rugged and as if they don't care suggests how masculine they are. 2) Just like straight women "dress to impress" men, some gays do the same.  Just to note, not *all* gay men dress better, just some. That's a bit of a stereotype, but this is ELI5, so I'm not going to make a big deal out of it.
Oh, okay. That makes a lot of sense! Thanks(:
Jiffy! 1:16-1:17
I don't think anyone sat down one day and "invented" a God/gods. I think that either God reaches out to people and reveals himself to them. I am a Christian becomes something inside me tells me that there is a God out there that loves me, and I couldn't believe otherwise if I wanted to. Does that mean my beliefs are correct? I hope so, but maybe not. And then there are people from thousands of years ago who thought that it simply made sense for an omnipotent being to have brought the world into existence. What I believe is that maybe God presents himself to people in different ways, and they see Him in ways that make sense to them or seem like the God that they want to love and worship.  I hope that made sense...
The one thing that really made me happy is now making me miserable...   I'm currently in high school and plan on pursuing a carrer in musical theatre. It has always been what I wanted to do. I know it's difficult and very likely that I will always be poor, but I'm okay with that because it made me happy and nothing else did. Recently my sister told me that I was a bad actor, and went into vivid detail of why she thinks so. She was angry with me at the time, but has never taken it back. Now every time I'm with my voice teacher I become insecure with myself and feel horrible for the next few days. I don't know what to do. I just feel like I have no idea what I'm doing and that I'm making a mistake... I don't know, I just feel awful. Like I said before, this was really the only thing that I am happy pursuing, but now every time I try I break down. I just feel like I'm never going to be happy with performing again. I'll just feel horrible afterward like I do after my lessons. I don't know, maybe it's all kind of ridiculous, but I feel like my world's falling apart even though I know I shouldn't let her get to me. Thanks for reading.  EDIT: Thank you all for your support and advice. I do want to say that I know very well that I will have a lot if criticism coming my way. The only reason it really bothered me is that this is my sister that has always supported me and been my biggest fan. I can take criticism, I just feel like she betrayed me as my sister and friend. She used to always be there for me and now I feel like she's against me. It wasn't the criticism itself. I just thought that needed to be said. Thanks again.
GORGEOUS! You look amazing. The look fits your very well(:
nice repost.
LOL! That intro made my day(: And I'm very glad to hear that I'm not the only one! I'm fairly young and somewhat new to the whole world of dating, and sometimes I get really afraid that there aren't other people (or men really) like us. So, even though people like us are a "rare breed," it is reassuring to hear from one.(:
LOL! That's great man, keep up the work. I always get excited when I see you appear(:
Just Wanted to Talk to You Guys   Hey fapstronauts. So I've been feeling really lost and alone on my journey lately. We're 60,000 strong and yet I feel really alone in my chalenge. Maybe it's because I don't post enough with you guys, but also because 1) there's noone I know personally to relate to with this and 2) I feel kind of like a minority here being a 15 y/o girl. My weakest temptations are the ones that make me fall, and then I sometimes don't even feel bad. Any words of advice or inspiration? Mostly, I just needed to vent a little.   NoFap, thank you for existing. Someday my life will different.
Thank you. I know, there really isn't much to say, but it's comforting just knowing that someone is reading this.
Haha, your welcome, I suppose. Honestly, the story is so amazing, I wouldn't normally care. The only reason I point it out is it was actually a vocabulary word of mine (being in high school and whatnot) and couldn't resist.  Thank you so much for your contribution to reddit. Your posts will never be forgotten.
What was it like when you saw yourself for the first time all doctored up? Was it a relief, or strange to see a new face? On that note, how similar do you look in comparison to before that son of a bitch decided to fuck with the wrong woman?  Thanks so much for answer *so. many. questions.* you truly are amazing and I wish you an amazing life here on out.
You know, there's a reason we have subreddits like /r/confession ... If this were real, it wouldn't be posted here.
**DON'T PRETEND YOU DON'T KNOW THAT WE GAVE YOU THE EIFFEL TOWER!!**
Oops, sorry, I don't know what I was thinking there. I meant more like 1.5ish. Woah, I honestly don't know why I put that...
fenÃªtre [fen-eh-tra (sorry for the shitty phonetics)]  It means window in French, and I think it's the prettiest word of all languages.
Ollie Seems To Enjoy His New Toy
I like it! The clothes and scenery are definitely great. I would definitely suggest taking off the glasses in the future. When you're in an audition, your auditioners want to see your face and your entire face. Also, I might try having the camera from a higher angle than you face. It makes the picture seem lighter and happier, but that's just a preference of mine. Nothing to look deep into.  You look great!
