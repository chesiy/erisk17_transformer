ITT: Redditors managing to forget that regardless of what Pao did or didn't do on this site, she was a scummy, shady character before she ever became CEO here and that was the reason why reddit didn't want her around.   You guys seem to conveniently forget that she sued her former mentor and boss for close to 100 million dollars in a gender discrimination suit in which she lost big time. You all seem to forget that she did so out of desperation because her husband bankrupted their family through a failed Ponzi scheme in which he drained the pension funds of many people through his criminal behavior that may well send him to federal prison at some point. She literally sued her past employer in Silicon Valley for nearly the exact same amount of money that her husband lost through his shady and criminal business dealings. How soon reddit forgets.   http://www.businessinsider.com/john-doerr-on-ellen-pao-suing-kleiner-perkins-i-was-sick-2015-6  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-18/kleiner-perkins-q-a-we-felt-betrayed-by-ellen-pao  http://www.forbes.com/sites/ellenhuet/2015/03/04/kleiner-perkinss-john-doerr-and-ellen-pao-a-mentorship-sours/  Totally turned on her mentor, boss, and "biggest advocate and defender" in order to try and loot his company for over 100 million dollars based on accusations that the jury ultimately found to be resoundingly baseless. She didn't get a cent and *she* has to pay her former boss and company's legal bills for suing them over a baseless accusation that threatened to tarnish the entire company and an honest guy who was her champion in Silicon Valley. Low life stuff from her.   You guys seem to forget that her and her husband are seedy, scummy, shady characters who have a history that is available for everyone to read about. Redditors found out about it and called her out for it in numerous threads before she even started doing anything unpopular on reddit and no one could understand why reddit would get into bed with not just her but with her husband since she was taking this job here as her "do or die" job where she was going to try and rebuild her image and career while facing down bankruptcy.   [Highly-entertaining profile on both of them that shows you who Pao and her husband are](http://fortune.com/2012/10/25/ellen-pao-buddy-fletcher/)  [Same as above. Very informative and entertaining read.](http://www.vanityfair.com/style/scandal/2013/03/buddy-fletcher-ellen-pao)  [The guy is a criminal. No two ways about it. Pao pulled the gender discrimination card only after her husband played the race card first. This is who these people are. They cry discrimination, sue people with deep pockets over it, and then sometimes come away with major settlements or punitive damages. Scummy people with little to no integrity.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_Fletcher)  [Update on their relationship and professional lives from this week.](http://nypost.com/2015/07/12/ellen-pao-hedgie-husband-are-losing-their-power-couple-status/)  You also seem to forget that she has a history of associating with the types of people labeled as social justice warriors and feminists who are big fans of censorship and that reddit rightly had major concerns about how she was going to run the website as a result. For example, her Twitter feed, friends, and tweets reeked of this sort of stuff before she even was CEO and it paints that picture of someone who reddit rightly didn't want anywhere near the main controls of this site. Her tweeting during in the lead up to her gender discrimination trial and all of her interactions on Twitter was something straight out of the Anita Sarkeesian playbook and it was noxious for me to read through since it just reeked of "I'm a victim please give me money" nonsense that we've seen before from professional victims like her. None of these views or opinions turned out to be erroneous at all because her and her husband have an open history of this sort of stuff and reddit watched her entire trial unfold for weeks and chronicled it all and found her to be what the jury found her to be: a scheming, cynical opportunist and hustler who was totally full of it and not credible.   These really aren't my sole opinions; they're the opinions of redditors that I have read about Pao since January yet people seem to be forgetting this week why she was so unpopular a selection for CEO in the first place. All of the people coming out of the woodwork this week acting like she literally did nothing wrong, was a good fit for CEO, and that she was wrongly chastized and scrutinized are pretty delusional and have bad memories. Did she personally ban FatPeopleHate? Probably not her personally but her and Alexis definitely sat down and agreed to get rid of the sub. Was reddit really so wrong to assume that **the CEO of this site was not the one who gave the order to ban FPH and other offensive subreddits?** Absolutely not. The CEO is very much the person calling the shots not just here but in most other companies or corporations so people coming out of the woodwork this week acting like reddit just pulled another Boston Bomber manhunt screw-up again are over-the-top and delusional.

Could someone explain why it's a good idea to not deport people who are in a country illegally?  Because Obama and the Democratic Party want America to turn into Brazil or South Africa demographically so that they never lose another election. Obama is going to amnesty all 11 million + illegal immigrants in this country so that he can ensure that he and the Dems run the country in the future without the GOP standing a chance. It's just racial mob rule democracy that the Founding Fathers never wanted in this country. Dems and Obama don't care. They're done courting the white vote so they're importing as many non-whites as they can who are lower class so that they vote for the party that gives them government benefits.
Oh, indeed.
Bro, do you even lift?
lol funniest comment so far in this sub. Yes, the mainstream media has totally *pivoted* from the fact that a White supremacist killed some blacks. Yes, our totally right wing media managed to pull one over on everyone by *pivoting* and making it all about the flag. lol wow dude. It totally wasn't the Left in this country and SJWs and black lives matter protesters who made it about systemic racism and the legacy of slavery and the Confederacy. It was totes the GOP or the media pulling our eyes away from the racial killing and towards the flag.   No one pulled anyone's eyes away from the killer. Are you even joking?   I would love for you to show me statistics about just how prevalent the beliefs of White supremacy are in our modern day GOP. Y'know, the GOP whose leaders don't even stand up to Obama when he tries to get 11 million illegal Hispanic immigrants amnesty in this country. McConnell and Boehner did nothing to stop him yet White supremacy is enough of a part of the GOP base that cosmic forces needed to *pivot* away from their "involvement" in the GOP. Funny stuff.

I'm just stopping by to say that the fact that no one in this thread has made a reference to *In Bruges* considering the title of this post is a disgrace. I award you all no points, and may God have mercy on your souls.
There's a big difference between secession - which is the legal and constitutional right of states should they seek it - and killing Jews and invading sovereign European nations like Hitler did. Learn your history before you post your pandering, smug may mays for le wise teenage redditors who just got out of school for summer and just completed their first government/civics course.
Man punches 80-year-old in store, knocking her to ground, deputies say: A 35-year-old South Carolina man is accused of a random assault on an 80-year-old woman as she stood in a grocery store. He has been arrested and charged with third-degree assault.
These South American teams are fun to watch when they play each other. I can't remember a match where they didn't attack for 90 minutes like this. I'm amazed that Mexico put out their B team and played that well. Raul Jimenez looks like a player. He hasn't played all that much for Atletico Madrid has he? If he plays like that in La Liga this season then Simeone will be a happy man.   Edit: Yes, I know Mexico is not from South America but they play with the same kind of style and verve.

"Tresspasser" is just a codeword for a black person amongst inhospitable white folk.  No, it's code for people that trespassed by accosting the pool security guard and climbing over fences to get into the pool when the rules of the pool state that you're only allowed to bring in two other friends with you to the pool. Random people showed up to this pool after some DJ tweeted about it and they didn't have a right to be there. The residents heard all of the loud noise coming from the hip hop music that was blaring, saw all of these people that clearly weren't residents of that community flooding towards the pool, saw altercations and fighting going on and then called the cops. They were trespassing.   most of whom clearly lived there  You just supported my point for me. Not all of them were welcome there. Most might have been. Some were not and the cops were called because they were trespassing.    their parents' HOA dues pay for  Some of them weren't from that community and neither were their parents so I don't know what you're talking about. Maybe try facts when you make points.    And as for the non-residents, black residents are entitled to have guests just like everyone else.  Yeah, only when they follow the rules which they didn't. Some were trespassing and those who weren't brought more than two friends to the pool which is against the pool rules.

Sarah Palin called out the mainstream media double standard of going after them while giving their feminist golden child Lena Dunham a pass for sexually molesting her little sister for years.

Cool. As long as its your tax dollars that pay for illegal immigrants to go to school while American citizens struggle to pay the costs of college and everything else then I'm alright with your delusional plan. Your tax dollars and money out of your pocket for non-Americans, not mine.
