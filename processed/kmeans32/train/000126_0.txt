I think this is a very good case for what might make the film *interesting*, particularly to a Hitchcock devotee, but I don't know that any of that amounts to "greatness," you know? Tommy Wiseau's [*The Room*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCj8sPCWfUw) is unquestionably the work of a singular voice, it does everything wrong according to Hollywood standards, it ends in tragedy, the protagonist is kind of nuts, there are several scenes that defy logic--and if I were a critic looking for kicks, I might even call it a deconstruction.  But art can move minds and hearts, if can fuck up your week, it can make you reorganize your life; that's something film is capable of, and that's what I need a great film to do. And I just don't see how the idiosyncrasies of Vertigo approach anything resembling greatness--that's the view to change, I'm afraid.
Well I *know* my birthday, I just wasn't really anticipating it and was surprised to realize that it was today. As a single 26 year old, there isn't too much fanfare about it.
All due respect, that's nonsense. People should be allowed to talk about sex with whatever level of frankness they want. What wound up being unintentionally hurtful here was that she was saying one thing to her friend and another thing to Fiver here, a little more loving frank talk with him might have enabled them to build a more honest and fulfilling sex life from the start.  To OP: your dick is fine, it's not broken, it's not deformed, but it's also not magic and that's okay, it's just a dick like everybody else's. Somebody loves you, don't fuck that up stressing about your dumb dick.
Well, yeah. See the literal millions of charismatic villains and anti-heroes in every narrative medium across human history.  You're probably more interested in *how* to make repellent characters likable though, which is a tougher question. For me, I think that the most liked "evil" characters have similar desires and motivations to us, but they lack those inhibitors that keep us moral. They're the devil on your shoulder, the id freed from the nuance of the ego.  In that sense, most compelling villains are ironically enough grounded in a relatable sense of righteousness. **Walter White (Breaking Bad)**: we all get sick of taking shit from people, he just pushes it to murder. **The Joker (Dark Knight)**: we all feel like there's something fucked in the regular social order, he just pushes it to anarchy. **Satan (Paradise Lost)**: we all want our freedom, he just pushes it to an unholy war against God Almighty. Villains have a good point, badly made.  The important balance, then, is in making sure the audience has more of a connection to the villain than his/her victims. I think there are two main ways to achieve this, without much middle ground: 1) you give him/her a story so sympathetic that the audience overlooks his/her faults, or 2) you make them so fucked up that their humanity catches the audience off guard and pulls their full focus--either way, the audience should feel that the villain reflects something in themselves. When you know **Professor Snape's (Harry Potter)** backstory, you'll forgive him any classroom tyrany; when **Jaime (Game of Thrones)** puts his life on the line for Brienne, it's such a shift that it upstages the child murder stuff.  **Tl;dr:** To whatever end you make them human, make it count.

I imagine  There's the rub.  Seriously though, there were no weapons capable of mass-killing in that time, and it's disingenuous to pretend hypothetical modern advanced weaponry ever crossed the minds of our founding fathers in this context. If you're actually interested in a good faith reading of what their intentions were--and it is pretty clear--simply read the ammendment itself: "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."

When defending digital effects to analog purists, this is literally always my top example of CGI done right. On the other end of the spectrum, *Scott Pilgrim vs. the World* is always second.
Why do you think that? She screams "Help" when Donkey Kong takes her and then has a love heart appear when Jumpman rescues her.
I'm not sure where I'm going here  Yeah, there's the rub. You're attributing the jokes to racism and anti-drug sentiment, you then provide a list of counter-examples to your own unsupported premise, lose the plot and call everybody hypocrites.  I don't hate Lil' Wayne, I clearly don't wish death on him, I don't much admire him either, whatever. If that "lil' seizey" crack is what's got you bothered, then get over it, it's a joke about a pop star on Reddit. If you were looking to gush about Tha Carter II and III and the Dedication mixtapes with other casual fans who have listened to everything Wayne ever did, then bummer dude, it was jokes this time.  Honestly, I'd much rather see a Modest Mouse repost every once in awhile than these whiny self-righteous teenager "disappointed" posts.
Red State
I can confirm it is totally legal and 100% safe, just a loophole that will probably be fixed soon but is great for those of use who can get it whilst it lasts.  Nope, doesn't clear up much at all. For my money, I'm completely unwilling to send personal payment to a stranger for an unsanctioned service upgrade, particularly if they're unwilling to offer information about who they are, their relationship to the company, and how this process supposedly works.  At best, I would guess that you're a Spotify employee exploiting your benefits for personal profit. At worst, you're scamming people out of $15 and/or their personal payment information. With all due respect, I remain justifiably skeptical and give your offer a downvote.
Thanks!

Come on now. It's 100% possible to have a principled vote based on policy stance parallel to appreciation of a very unique and sincere display of presidential emotion--this man has literally put up with more bullshit than anyone in the world over the last four years, and it's gratifying to see that he's still committed to the stuff I believe in. If you want to write off 61170405 votes as "pshhh guess they're all just *in love with him*," then that's your business, but it seems like a bizarre and sweeping generalization with no supported link to liberal values.

Yeah, I'm aware of the AIDS crisis, thanks. Leaving my panties out of the equation, an artist has a uniquely privileged voice. They can use that voice to stick it to anyone they want. In this song, Axl Rose used his voice to stick it to the mistrusted and downtrodden, the disenfranchised, the *literally dying and beaten minorities* around him. I never knew about it, I shared it, I think it's interesting in its own unfortunate way--I come down on the side of "Fuck him then," but other than that, it ain't that deep.
Great, thoughtful response. It seems reasonable that any "God" would be something beyond human understanding.  My question, if I may: what happens to God when our understanding improves? If there is a definite God beyond the threshold of our comprehension, then it seems like perfect hypothetical understanding of the universe would prove its existence. And yet, for many people, knowing and comprehending a "formula" for all existence like you suggest would be the ultimate triumph of atheism, as there would be no higher power than that.  So: is it *conceivable* that God could exist once we have full knowledge of the universe, and if so, what would that God look like? If not, can God be said to exist at all?
Ah.
That's silly.
Whatever your personal journey has been, I'm genuinely happy for you that you've arrived at something you consider happiness and enlightenment--I was raised Catholic, I can relate. My point is that beautiful snowflake that you are, we're all beautiful snowflakes here: it's the philosophy subreddit, we're *all* pretentious assholes who view the world in terms of invisible social influences. Instead of writing like a cult leader and spreading your words across subreddits 'cause you're just that important, try engaging us as fellow thinking people. Don't try to enlighten us, try to relate to us. I suspect we've got more in common than you think, and arrogant pricks that we are, we don't like being talked down to. :)
Fair enough, though I think that the fact that they had no expertise was pretty much the point. It's one isolated incident, and it's then left to us to critically examine whether or not similar propagation of trendy bullshit is happening elsewhere. My personal distaste for the anti-science strains of postmodernism notwithstanding, I think that it's always worthwhile to be reminded that reason and substance *should* trump authority and fashion, even if that's not always the case in popular thought.

100% yes as a part of the curriculum, 100% no as an alternative to math. That shit's important.
No, Egodeath, I don't. I was trying to figure out why you were running an annoying joke predicated on your unsupported sense of superiority into the ground, and I figured that in the absence of any approval from those seeking discussion here, you might have a private audience of people who favor pointless snark over interpersonal engagement--turns out it's just you, super. I believe that's called "trolling," right?  Predicated: founded or based on.
Out of touch with wider cinema culture and how it reflects what what happened artistically and commercially in 2010, out of touch with what will be remembered from this year, out of touch with a number of very good films--some better than those included on the list--because limited or non-existent release was a prerequisite. And that's what bothers me, Winkyburger, when this form of art that I love is co-opted by people more concerned with exclusivity than quality.  And honestly, not trying to be a jerk, but I really don't know what are you arguing at this point. Are you saying that this list *is* a perfect expression of what happened in film 2010? Are you saying that it's not but we should pretend that it is? Please clarify.
guys, look, i'm not unaware of the Catholic authority hierarchy. I'm merely saying that Catholic culture and identity stretches beyond simple Vatican policy, and to declare someone uncatholic for her liberal understanding of the dogma is to misinterpret what being Catholic is in practice. Looking at the way Catholics live their lives in reality is a valid alternative understanding of Catholicism, and in my opinion a far more productive understanding than some purely theoretical Catholic ideal that's never happened. Honestly, I feel like my argument is being willfully misinterpreted at this point. Also, good one on the 3/5. Catholics be sexist. :)
holy shit.
bit on the nose, eh?
