I think they just license the name for perfume branding.
I recommend education, not like a full on degree programs but like a vocational skill. Check out your community college wrists if you are in the US, Europe: no idea. But there's courses that last 6 months or so and you can make above minimum wage like double. Costs for such classes are usually $1000usd.
No, it is not, because your standard of living only gets you the basics: food, shelter, utilities, clothes at $2400 USD. Oh and *quality is important*    Edit: you can't just go out buy thing's when needed, want a good used car because your current one is beyond repair? Well good luck! Finance it? Not a chance, look at the interest rates!
It has great acting, but I found it cheesy
How is it?
True fit. Done websites have a button for it. You type in sizes in the brands that you know and it recommends sizes in the brand that you are about to buy
When your country is underdeveloped, you need assistance from other people, usually they are from the west because that's where all the best universities are and that's why rich Asians send their kids to USA, Canada to study, when Cambodia devolps, they can take care of themselves. For now they just focus on food, shelter, and water.

First it was charter now time warner? What is happening?
People have said religion, but the problem goes far beyond the scope of religion. Its oppression, created by their leaders and social structure not Islam and economic disadvantage and the lack of education due to the lack of a good economy to support a knowledge base.   People are drawn to ISIS because they believe that by joining ISIS they'll escape oppression in turn leading to a more comfortable live. THEY ARE SO WRONG. ISIS does everything that's against Islam. In Islam you'll go to hell for persecuting other religions, especially Christianity and Judaism, to which Islam shares so much with. One of the main Islamic celebrations is from God asking Abraham to sacrifice his son Isaac which is in Christianity.  Also Muslims believe is Jesus.  So it makes no sense to persecute these "unbelievers". ISIS will survive by oppression. These ISIS members think they'll be free from their current tyrannical despots but they are just feeding another tyrannical despot.   In Islam men and women are equal in any social structure. However, people will not know this unless they're educated, in the sense of religion and the regular schooling, SIS is not going to be willing to provide education that is free of censorship. These ISIS subjects will never know what real Islam is. The Islam they'll know is the version that best fits the needs of ISIS.   Like the Al Qa'ida, they'll garner a bad reputation for the Muslims living abroad in the West (read reddit comments below for proof). They'll do this so the Westerners are racist and stereotypical towards the Muslims in turn the oppressed joins/ understands ISIS's cause.   The best course of action for the Western countries is not only to bomb these fuckers, but to spread what the real Islam says via radio and TV broadcasts. I assure you that most of ISIS's members are uneducated and thus they are easily deceived by ISIS's Imams because they have always been told to trust like you would trust a man in an uniform than the guy with chinos and a t shirt on.

I'll look for the sun through the dark, ominous clouds thanks
Why the hell can't we force "everyone" to plant 1 tree, provided at no cost by some org. or govt, the peoole will save money on AC cost cause shade and make "everyone" place 1 solar panel at their house, if the requirements are met/reasonable, which will feed into the power supply?   We already make people in the US have a recycling bin. With 1 solar panel at everyone's house the power   companies will save money when it  comes to buying land to place  massive solar farms and other costs.  The aesthetic aspect will greatly increase too.

Sorry I didn't mean to quote the source.  Simply commending your skills!
Damn, that last bit of loaded language will sure get you up votes! I commend your skillz!!!   I don't know about you, but I'd pay $8.75 per year to make sure that the cops in my town aren't shooting people they don't like, raping people because they are horny and [randomly accusing people of resisting arrest so that they can beat the shit out of them.](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/pittsburgh-man-wins-119-thousand-in-civil-rights-suit-against-police/)
This is what I'm going to say to people from now on!
I always wondered this, when songs on the radios are playing do you guys just chill out until you have to talk again?
