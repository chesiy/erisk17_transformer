Hey, you're the one who made the incorrect statements about "here in the USA" and what the minimum wage is. I just corrected you.   HTH HAND
As the father of a six year-old I can say that I've sat through worse movies.   It's not cringey bad or particularly stupid or annoying. It's a breezy 90 minutes with a bunch of minion business for the kids, a few jokes for the adults and a nice sixties vibe that plays pretty well, all things considered.  It is incredibly lazy. There's really no story or point to anything. Just a lot of running around and silliness and then it ends.  It made me think of some of the interviews Pete Docter gave about Inside/Out. Apparently the early versions of the script had a lot of funny bits with Joy and Fear, but it didn't go anywhere and didn't have much of a point to it. He worked on it constantly for months after that trying to crack it.  Whereas, when the Minons team got to the point they obviously just said, "Fuck it, good enough" and called it a day.
I'm not a fan of the TPP, but realize that all he's done is get authority to negotiate an agreement and get an up or down vote from Congress. We don't know what's in the agreement because there is no agreement. It's still being negotiated.    All we've got so far is a bunch of leaked bits and pieces of various proposed parts of it from people who, quite frankly, have their own agendas.
Just to be clear, there's no law that says a 1099 workers should be paid more than a w2 worker for the same work. It's just a general business guideline. An employer is free to pay an independent contractor whatever rate is agreed upon.  On the other hand, if you have been improperly classified as a 1099 worker, the IRS can reach back quite a ways to sanction your employer. The only real benefits for you would be a possible rebate of self-employment tax that you paid to the IRS in those years as well as eligibility for unemployment insurance.  http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses- -Self-Employed/Independent-Contractor-Self-Employed-or-Employee
No, this is horseshit that Southern Pride people tell themselves.  Go read the articles of secession.  http://www.civilwar.org/education/history/primarysources/declarationofcauses.html  Here's Georgia's  For the last ten years we have had numerous and serious causes of complaint against our non-slave-holding confederate States with reference to the subject of African slavery. They have endeavored to weaken our security, to disturb our domestic peace and tranquility, and persistently refused to comply with their express constitutional obligations to us in reference to that property, and by the use of their power in the Federal Government have striven to deprive us of an equal enjoyment of the common Territories of the Republic.   The Confederate States clearly lay out why they are seceding and, in the main, that reason is slavery. Read the actual, historical documents, not the crap southern apologists spout.

Never get out of the car. Never ever get out of the car in a situation like that.  My driver's ed teacher told me a story of a student of his who loved to fight. Big guy. Strong. Loved to scrap.  So one day he gets rear ended and he gets out of the car, fists up, ready to mix it up.  The other guy just shoots him.  A couple years back I was driving to work after dropping off my daughter and some asshole in a landscaping truck is behind me and honking every time I stop at a stop sign. Like he doesn't understand the concept.   It's a nice day and I have the window down, so after a couple of these I make a comment or two out the window about his lack of understanding of traffic rules. At the next stop he stops his truck,and gets out. I can see him walking towards me in the side view mirror.  For about a half second I contemplated getting out of the car and teaching this asshole a lesson. Then I'm thinking that I'm a grown man with a family and a mortgage, the last thing I want is to bleed out in the street because someone honked at me at a stop sign.   So I waited for him to get close, then I put my foot down and drove away.

So, did everyone just forget that the Florick/Prady election was the Democratic Primary?   One of things that really bugs me about this season is the sloppiness, inconsistency and continuity issues. I mean, which firm's e-mails did the hackers get again. When Alicia and Will exchanged those sexy e-mails, they were working for Lockhart Gardner, which is a completely different entity than Florick Agos/Florick, Lockhart   Agos.  Anyway, It's established early on that Prady and Alicia are both Dems. In S06E09 we have the DINO (Democrat In Name Only) spot.   In a heavily Democratic area like Cook County, the Democratic Primary is essentially the election, but you still have to have an election. You can't say that the winner is the SA-elect.  Moreover, if the election that was potentially spoiled was the Democratic Primary, there's no way that the Dems could have lost a seat in the state legislature if there was a recount.   Nothing from this whole SA plot makes any sense at all.
I am amortizing the cost of the battery over the amount of energy it could reasonably be expected to produce. How you intend to use the battery is irrelevant. If you have an issue with my calculations, I'd be interested to hear it.   As for your calculations, the numbers you're using are way low. To disconnect from the grid you'd probably need at least two, probably three batteries to account for days with low or no sun. Even assuming you do the install yourself, which wouldn't be allowed by Tesla at this point, you haven't even added in the cost of an inverter to your package.  Unless you really want to get off the grid for some reason, grid connected solar with net metering and energy buyback from your electric company makes a lot more economic sense at this point than buying a $3000 battery.
Well, I'm sure there will be sports on the broadcast channels, but your wouldn't be paying extra for sports cable channels like ESPN, NFL Network, YES, etc.
Just a little salt, please.  I don't get the ketchup thing at all.
I always find it fun and a little mind-boggling to talk about this stuff.   I bought my first computer in 1983 with money I saved from my paper route. As an aside, there's another thing consigned to the dustbin of history, the paper route.  I got a Commodore 64. It cost me $300. The price had just been cut from $600 and I jumped right on that. I couldn't swing the money for a floppy drive, so I got the attachment that let me save my programs on a cassette tape. Later on I'd get the money for a real disk drive and a 300 baud modem. I was living in the future.
It's kind of amazing to me that we have military bases named after men who broke their oaths to support and defend the Constitution and took up arms against the lawfully elected government of the United States.
Some professional sports teams sneak a "state of the art" clause in their stadium deal, forcing state and local governments to fund an unending series of upgrades and updates to their arenas addition to the huge expense of building the place in the first place.
I recently binged the entire series and I think it holds up pretty well.  There's a lot of meh in seasons 1 and 2, but I think you can say that about any of the Star Trek series. Once you get to season 3 things are really clicking and season 4 was very enjoyable.  I bailed out the first time around after season 2. In retrospect, I should have kept with it.  The finale was terrible, though.
As high as necessary to make the job worthwhile for you.  The only thing I'd say is not to get ahead of yourself. You don't know what their offer will be or even if you'll get one. Wait until you have the  numbers, then decide.
If he thought what he was doing was legal, then he should have gone to court and argued the point.  It's clear that he knew what he was doing was illegal because, instead of downloading the JSTOR files from his desk at Harvard, he went to MIT and abused their open computer resources to make his political point.   In the process, he created no end of headaches for the network admins at MIT as well as students, faculty and researchers who had their access to JSTOR curtailed while Swartz evaded their attempts to kick him off their network.
Except that this is not true at all.   The US Attorney's office released some "get tough" press release where they said Aaron was potentially facing thirty or fifty years in prison or whatever. They took all the crimes he was charged with, added up the max sentences and voila, he's spending the rest of his life in prison. You see this kind of thing all the time. Blah blah person is facing SIX HUNDRED YEARS in prison or some nonsense.  Except that Federal sentencing doesn't work that. There are guidelines based on intent, damage caused, the number of offenses, etc. Given the circumstances it was very unlikely that Aaron would have gotten more than a year and even possible that he would have gotten off with probation.  It's a little confusing for some people because the CFAA, like a lot of federal crimes has a hefty max penalty, 20 years in this case, but no minimum.
Why would you consider taking this offer? What's the point of going down in title and responsibility for a $5K bump?   Do they offer something else that you want? Is there more opportunity at the new place? And why would you even think that you're a "self-entitled jerk" because you're unhappy that they pulled a bait and switch on you?
I don't know whether you can do the work or not, but I can tell you that everyone feels like this at one time or another. Google "Imposter Syndrome" and read up on it. It's very common.  Nobody knows everything. Everybody has to look shit up.   Put your head down, work hard, use your brain and if you feel unsure of yourself, just fake it 'til you make it.  Good luck!
What's the best way to recover control of an inactive Google Places/Google Business listing?   I do web sites for small, local businesses. An issue I've been running into more and more is that the business will have a Google Places listing that was set up for their business by someone else some time ago. They have no control of it and have no idea who might.   Right now I have three clients who are in this situation, a small HVAC contractor, a pizza place and a lighting shop. The pizza place is really in bad straights because the Google listing points to a domain that is now owned by a domain squatter.  I have submitted the recovery form and then followed up with an e-mail, but no luck so far.  Any help or directions would be appreciated.
I have the original ARC/uncorrected proof of Name If The Wind. Any idea what it might be worth?   So I'm decluttering and getting rid of a bunch of old stuff I don't want anymore. I have the original bound galley of Name Of The Wind with the note from Betsy Wollheim  on the cover.   I know that this was considered quite the collectible at one time, but I can't find any listings for it online.
