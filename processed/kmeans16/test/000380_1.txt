ayy lmao
Nooo :'C
Perfectly normal, perfectly healthy.  aha!
I don't wanna explain too much bcause it might go against lore and have it all go down the drain.  On the other hand it's a metaplane  yeah i'l just introduce some more people maybe some animals that were also caught in the blast and they'le meet while climbing the tower  "I haven't seen the tower light up in a long time" could the spirit say.  how do we get out?  "if you want to technobabble talk to the one who's in charge of it"
Woah is that really how he's depicted?
Makes sense  I understood whar you said i just added a few points.
lol yeah could've said a little more than that.
Would i be able to play as a character made for Nobilis (As in the players are incarnations of an aspect of reality ie: fire, swords,cats-with-blue-eyes,etc?) the characters are IMMENSlY powerful beings limited to their resources (miracle points) that can only be recharged when they role-play well(It' kinda tricky to get them back so most just hoard them for a long long time).   some of them are immortal tough as in immortal cannot die kind of way.  they have complete control over their aspect (if they can spend the MP for it) BUT they also must protect it otherwise he will get weaker and weaker until that aspect is completly removed from existence.  and some have items or abilities that are very powerful but also cost MP to use.  i think it'd be fun mortal characters interacting with characters like that striking deals with "Gods" and such.  Could this be the dat where i find a Sandbox game that allows me to play with my characters from Nobilis?  If you'd like more details or wanna discuss things feel free to do ask.
FU?
Sell me on Wild Talents
ELI5: IP adressing and IP classes   i don't understand the math or reason behind both.
This black pony sounds suspiciously like Cr1Tikal
It says on the official page one of the reviews say that it's similar to Nobilis, that's why i said that.
How powerful can a rifts character become?
that's a good point too particular event or people.
Help me come up with a magic system for Fate core.   So i have been trying to make a magic system for fate core and this is by no means finished it's just an idea and i'm trying to get the idea of it before the mechanics, here's what i have in mind.  i thought of magic working like the materia from FF7 as in switch them and make them stronger through use, i have taken the habit to go to the super power wiki and taking a look at the powers and checking them out  Let me give you an example let's say the gm gives a player the following Materias:  Fire manipulation.  Then he chooses the applications  Applications would be the uses of the power you start with two of those and with milestones in game you would give the Materia (i'l get to that) access to more application, of course the gm dictates what is "legal" as an application because some of them have applications that could ruin a game.  So the players chooses these as he would choose aspects of sorts:  Create/Generate/increase,shape. (this counts as one, the gm might think otherwise tough)  Flame Solidification.  and he would choose stunts called techniques if he wants for ways to use these powers with greater mastery such as Pyrokinetic Constructs for flame solidification.  that's what i got for this step, it's not very well translated from what i have in mind but it's an approximation  Now i thought this stuff is way too op and it is ,so i decided that using Materia recklessly would make you go insane instead of using a mana sort of thing.  When a player fails to cast a Materia properly he rolls a skill that the gm finds appropriate, the player is encouraged to give suggestions to the gm as in what skill he should roll, to circumvent a disaster.  the gm says what could happen as in what the calamity would be either bad for the caster or for people around him.  Example: The Player with the fire Materia tries to fling a fireball at someone,he rolls, he fails , so the gm says "well, you have a big fireball in your hand and it's about to blow up in your face and burn everyone around you, you lost control of the flames."  The player might suggest "i want to use my WILL to stop the flame from blowing up by concentrating to appease the flames "   The gm agrees, next time this happens he might choose another way the spell could go wrong always withing the powers of the Materia tough. the player rolls he succeeds but what if he had failed? well the player could use a fate point to negate any negative implications or endure the consequences, this might seem way to cruel but with the appearance of more powerful Materias this is a must.  But of course the gm is expected to offer worse implications to botching a power of greater magnitude as in things getting way way worse for having greater power means greater possible destruction.  Botching a spell completely makes everything go bat-shit crazy and that includes you for a while it scales with level of failure.  I have more but what do you guys think as of now?
