Your welcome, I hope it's helpful.
[Actually the nfl does admit officiating mistakes.](https://www.google.com/search?btnG=1 pws=0 q=nfl+admits+officiating+mistake)   While I do agree the larger sample size of plays/possessions/games allows more room for error by the NBA officials, it doesn't mean they are more competent at their jobs and it doesn't mean that their bad calls don't have an equally significant impact on the game.  The bad calls nba refs make are just less obvious and their impacts are less obvious.  A few bad ticky-tack fouls on a player early on in the game does alter how they play and limit their playing time. A recent example that comes to mind is Lebron James against the Pacers in last years playoffs.    Plus the nba empowers their refs to give technical fouls and kick guys out for "showing up the refs." Which can lead to [Joey Crawford.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2SYIrUnf5Y#t=1m25s) The nfl can give out personal foul calls but they rarely kick guys out of games, and if they do it is for throwing a punch not hurting a referee's feelings.  There was also a recent [game fixing scandal in the NBA regarding one of its refs.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_NBA_betting_scandal).  And the NBA completely absolved Tim Donaghy. Also before the NBA got Sportsvu for the whole league, the Sportsvu cameras actually collected data on the refs.  But afterwards the NBA actually stopped collecting or reporting that information. Check out this [bit for the BS report with Haralabos Voulgaris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s1TVQhDYgg#t=47m) that covers the Donaghy scandal and the Sportsvu data.  So all this hoopla over the ref transparency reports is just a bunch of bullshit.  If the NBA really cared about transparency they should not have stopped collecting or reporting the Sportvu referee data.  Here are two lists of controversies involving officiating from both leagues: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League_controversies#Controversial_calls https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association_criticisms_and_controversies#Conspiracies  In the end officiating is equally terrible in both sports. It could be because it is a hard job, or it's hard to judge good or bad officiating (we seem to notice bad officiating but we rarely compliment or notice good officiating),  maybe the refs are just incompetent, or some combo of each. I would like both leagues to be more transparent when reporting on referee performance and I want both leagues to lessen the impact of bad officiating on the games.  But that is hard to do and probably unlikely when both leagues want to constantly change/add/enforce rules that lead to less/safer physical contact between players for the sake of increased offensive output.  Because we all know more offense means more viewers, which means more revenue for the leagues.
perhaps...
Is there a website or dataset that keeps track of the funding for scientific studies/publications?
Yes!
Playoff QB Performance based on DVOA 1989-2013 (x-post from /r/nfl) [OC]   I created [this](https://savvas.shinyapps.io/qb_shiny/) interactive graph of QB playoff performance based on DVOA since 1989.  All the data comes from [this](http://www.footballoutsiders.com/stat-analysis/2014/nfls-best-playoff-quarterbacks-dvoa-and-dyar) Football Outsiders article.  [Here's my code.](https://github.com/savvastj/qb_shiny) Let me know what you guys think of it.  I'm open to suggestions on how to make it better.
You can run a Linux distro via crouton on the Toshiba CB2.  I'm running Elementary OS via crouton right now and runs pretty well. However any chromebook with an Intel Bay Trail processor won't be able to run Linux via Chrubuntu.
I don't think it's flash, I use youtube magic actions and force HTML5 playback on videos.  Most 1080p vids playback well, but there are just some that just stutter, like this one [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRqPPFREx4 index=2 list=UUXGgrKt94gR6lmN4aN3mYTg)  As for when I'm running ElementaryOS I have stuttering issues all the time when trying to run play youtube videos.
Performance is just fine outside of video playback.  It can't play certain youtube videos at 1080p which is dissappointing.  It also can have some stuttering issues when playing back video on a 2nd monitor and doing something on the laptop screen.  I am looking forward to future iterations of this laptop with better CPU.
It's silver.
It all depends on what you can get for him of course.  Before this weeks games I was able to package him, Matt Ryan and Ertz for Gronk and Aaron Rodgers.  You could probably do better after today's game.  You've seen his best game of the year so if you want to flip him for something else go right ahead.

All valid points and you are right to say that a single payer system may not be the most efficient system for the US. I can't say what system would be more efficient.  I do think that the US needs tighter control over its healthcare system, with the ACA the country is moving in the right direction.  The top 3 (Hong Kong, Singapore, and Japan) most efficient systems do have tight controls over their systems even though the implementations of each system are quite different from on another.

Good luck with your interviews! And thanks for the responses everyone. Your insights have been quite helpful.  I think I will end up going back to school in the fall to take a few comp sci courses to have a better foundation in that field, as well as taking a couple more math classes (calc 2 and linear algebra).  From that point I hope to apply to a grad program.  In the meantime I will try to learn as much R, Python and data science/ ML concepts in order to develop my own projects and try my hands on a few Kaggle competitions.  Hopefully this works out well, and thanks again.
Yea there is that possibility. However there are apps that let you use either a smartphone or tablet as a remote for the android mini pc.  I currently use the droidmote app on my galaxy s3 or nexus 7 to control an asus tf700t connected to my tv.  There's also a cheapcast app that emulates certain features of chromecast (ie Youtube casting) that one could also use.
Wilfork was healthy at the time, NE run defense has been non-existent since his injury.  Like you noted Spiller was unhealthy during the Miami game so.  Pitt is a better run defense than JAX according to DVOA coming into this week: http://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/teamdef  That Pitt game, the whole Bills offense was just awful, it was Manuel's first game back from his knee injury.  It was just good to see Spiller play with the same explosiveness he had last year, even when he came back after limping off the field.

I think you may be over reacting to the Rodgers injury.  We have seen good RBs do well with bad QBs, ie Stacy, AD, Charles, etc.  Obviously it would be better to have Rodgers at QB but I trust McCarthy to come up with a good offensive game plan.  He is a good coach, he had Favre and Flynn (albeit in a small sample size) look good in his system.  Lacy's schedule is just as easy Morris'. While the redskins o-line is probably better, the packer's o-line has been pretty solid at run blocking.    With all that being said, I view both Morris and Lacy pretty similarly.  They are probably anywhere in the 8-12 range in RB rankings.
Fair points.  I do feel like I should wait a week or 2 before deciding on making such a drastic move. EJ manuel is also a FA so I may drop someone for him.  I ended up making another thread to hopefully get some more input on this.  But again thanks!
Also thanks for the help
I'm pulling off a big trade in a 16 team league.  I'm 8-1 and looking to get and upgrade at QB and maximize my starting lineup for the playoffs.    I have Glennon, Vick and alex smith at QB.  RBs are Stacey, Lacy, Spiller, ellington, cj anderson and johnathan franklin.  WRs are Brown, Decker, and Keenan Allen. TE is graham.   I'll be packaging Allen, Ellington, Alex smith, cj anderson, and either Decker or Brown for Andrew luck, Dez Bryant, Steve Smith, David Wilson and Robert woods.  So I'm stuck deciding who I would rather have for the rest of the year, Brown or Decker

Update on the situation: https://twitter.com/ConorTOrr/status/388765847554383872  From rotoworld: "That's not the way it was presented to me," Coughlin said. The Giants' coach gave a "vague timeline" on Wilson's return at 3-4 weeks, although none of this really matters until Wilson gets a second opinion on his neck during Monday's visit with specialist Dr. Robert Watkins. Wilson owners should still fear the worst, but keep Wilson rostered until the Watkins results are known
Has the Bears run defense been this mediocre this year?
And Randle is soooo stupid.
This is my internal dilemma.  As much as I love technology, I know whatever I decide to buy will just promote a business model that includes exploiting another human being.  The only way to stop this is to just not buy from companies who are complicit in this type of behavior. And that is why I've started to purchase second hand items.  It doesn't directly support firms who allow for these awful working conditions, I end up buying the product  at a cheaper price, and I'm not being completely wasteful and adding demand for a new product that really isn't that much different than the one that came before it.    Also is there a site or subreddit that keeps track of companies that force their workers to work in such awful conditions? Is there a site or subreddit that keeps track of the companies that do the exact opposite and pay their employees respectable wages or even living wages for producing all these consumer goods?  EDIT: And this is why I also don't necessarily bitch about prices on products.  There is a limit I am willing to spend on something but bitching about prices is just silly.  The price of a product is a derivative of its cost and demand.  If I want to buy something new that is cheap it most likely means that the cost of labor associated to it is cheap, which in turn means that person or people who created this product are most likely not being paid a sufficient amount to make the item.
