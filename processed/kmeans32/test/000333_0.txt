The premise for this whole article is falsethe movie was actually made for me: a middle-aged guy that grew up on comics books, and has enough disposable income to totally geek out and buy the movie, the toys, etc in an effort to re-capture the youth that is quickly disappearing in the rearview mirror. It was made for the geeks that read every blog post about the whos and whys, looked at all the production stills and followed the negotiations between Marvel and Fox to allow Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch to appear in both films. It was made of the geeks that watch a less-than-stellar show like Marvel Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. simply because it is part of the MCU. It is made for the geeks that actually know what the MCU stands for. It is made for the geeks that are scared they will have their first heart attack before we finally get to see Thanos on screen for any longer than a fleeting cameo (2019 or 2020).  Stand aside 9 year olds, this isnt your movie. It is mine. And I loved it.

Who do you like? Einstein left his wife to raise their two children alone, including a schizophrenic child -- for his cousin. Gandhi urged his wife not to accept Western medicine based on religious beliefs, and she died of a highly curable disease in prison. When Gandhi got the same disease next month, he took the Western medicine and cured himself. Bob Marley had more kids with more women than Thomas Jefferson did with his slaves. How about George Washington? Another person who owned people as if they were objects, forcing them to live their whole lives, generation after generation in poverty. Che? There is one man who led a rather prestige private life. Christian, vegetarian, not an alcoholic, probably never tried any drugs. He even started the fight against smoking. His name is Adolf Hitler. Chose wisely why you dismiss someone and why you follow them. Bill Clinton was by far a better president than Bush (he caused much less pain worldwide than Bush did) but I think anyone would agree that Clinton is morally bankrupt when compared to Bush in their private lives.

Nearly all of today's luxury food started out as peasant food, in fact that's a whole side of high-end French cuisine today. The truth is, we do live in the real world today and lobster is expensive and appreciated as a treat. To throw it in a shitty bun and slather it in crappy tinned dry seasonings and mayo is just a waste because any of the other lesser meats would suffice. That you people can't grasp that is just... pathetic and nationalist, as always.  I wonder if this guy tries his material out on his mom before typing it into Reddit.

Not by much. A lot of his scenes were left in. The major changes by Lindelof and Scott were done by the studio; No Xenomorphs, the pod sequence was changed, the ending was a little more open, and the love making sequence doesn't end with a xenomorph popping out.   The only change I think would have made the film better was if David did follow through with believing he was an heir to the engineers and not having the black goo sequence. Other than that, his delusions are a little unexplained. The scene that was removed about Shaw and David with the facehugger had the potential to be extremely corny.

It's not a fallacy, it's a documented reality. We like to think we're immune to tyrannies, but the truth is it takes vigilance, and sometimes over-reaction, in order to prevent them. It's a tug of war, and just because we're winning doesn't mean we can stop tugging - the other side sure won't.  Best of Outrage Culture worthy in that Advice Animals Thread.  The conspiracy Yishan PR machine is apparently waking up in that Technology thread:   Yishan is bitter Pao was thrown under the bus by Alexis and the board. He recommended her for the post, and I will bet half my karma that they have a personal relationship as well. Now he sees the perfect opportunity to get back at Alexis and the board, with some grade A shit posting. Check out some of his previous comments in the past few days, you'll get the gist. No complaints from me though, makes for some excellent popcorn.  Holy hell, this is some prime cookery:  How is that a 'PR spin machine'? That all seems terrible for reddit the company. This isn't PR spin machine, it's someone who is mad and getting revenge by airing the dirty laundry Its PR for Yishan's cause. I hope he at least gets some of that pussy from all this white knighting.  Now the Reddit celebrities are chiming in. A famous Lizard of War has appeared:  I'm a bit confused, perhaps you can clarify what you mean:  Reddit caused Ellen's departure (you did it reddit!) but Ellen says it didn't and the board confirms.   - Ellen was all about free speech and fatpeoplehate was only banned for inciting off-site but dozens of parody subreddits were banned after that did nothing off-site and hundreds of people were shadowbanned for criticizing her? Did she know this was happening?  - With Ellen at the helm, Reddit was immune to being criticized for intentionally creating a racist / sexist environment but Reddit is the users, not the corporate structure. How could Reddit, Inc. be criticized for promoting free speech?   - This entire time you had vital information that could have saved your friend embarrassment and mental anguish but you didn't say anything because of "Executive Privilege?"  I dunno man, this doesn't make sense to me.  The only way this all works in my head is if Ellen was a figurehead with no actual power, had nothing to do with the contradictory decisions made, and you were under some sort of gag-order.  Maybe this was all a giant cluster-fuck of epic proportions and the lack of communication was the result of internal squabbling, but honestly, I love Reddit and I expect better.
We've seen what "ignoring the subs" cause. It creates Fat People Hate to grow to its bulbous size and when the admins finally decide they've had enough of them, they boot them from the site causing a tidal wave of thousands of seemingly 20 something adults throwing internet temper tantrums.   Clearly, ignoring and going about your Redditing experience doesn't work. It just allows large concerted efforts to grow a shitty user base to go unabated and then it seeps into other Sub Reddits. If you want to see the affect of ignoring a problem just look at the /r/videos threads where a woman talks about [domestic abuse](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/3cjgit/26_year_old_woman_from_ireland_posts_video_about/) or [isolated incidents at Wal-Mart.](https://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/3cdhte/walmart_has_the_worst_customers/csuoqq7)
Paper Mill Review of Secret Diary of a Call Girl   This is a film which involve sex industry. Sometimes I think I would rather to catch a triply to watch than to sleep with a dull man, Because each set is very short, it probably still can give you the climax, even it is a neuter version. I still remembered that I really did't think Belle is a beautiful woman when I watched season one. But I have been able to appreciate her beauty to season four. I like to watch her to receive each customer in high spirit. She let me become more believe that there is some people really like to be a prostitute as career. From her, I felt a little shamed, I just in labor, I didn't work hard.but she does't.   Ben and Han is alike,both are brave,Both have the courage to make a choice, choose what they want, rather than they should.From the start, Ben appeared in Han's world, his state cannot be removed. From season one Ben delayed he and Vanessa' s wedding ceremony, at that moment, I knew he was really love Han.real love. But they finally broke up. Ben wants a family,but Hannah cannot give. just because she know she cannot give,she choose to leave. Hannah just wants to be herself.They separate,not because they don't love each other, they are too love.they love, but cannot give each other they want. So they say goodbye. Losing Ben, it means, Hannah and bell lose everything, but she finally decide so. love, like on you.   In fact, I know they will not be together at last, but I still hoping. Finally I having no choice but to Give up the lens. Sometimes. Two people who love each other deeply always can not be together. That's it. If it's you. Would you do as Hannah. Choose to leave because love too much. When you can't give your lover what he needs. When you can't let him be happiness. choose to leave is more great than to possess him.
"All of these histrionic hyperbolae and identity politics and psychodramas are part and parcel of the media's stock in trade...many of whom are by now all too familiar with its played-out professional victim routine."   Allow me to submit for your fair-minded consideration the following "news diff" of a recent article from the venerable New York Times. Compare and contrast, if you will, these two timestamped versions of the "same" story on Ellen Pao's resignation from Reddit:  [Comparing: Its Silicon Valley 2, Ellen Pao 0: Fighter of Sexism Is Out at Reddit](http://newsdiffs.org/diff/934341/934454/www.nytimes.com/2015/07/11/technology/ellen-pao-reddit-chief-executive-resignation.html)  Now you may not care about the goings on at Reddit, but be that as it may, this shoddy piece of yellow journalism perfectly exemplifies the *narrative* that pervades so much of today's news. What was once a merely slanted article entitled "Ellen Pao Is Stepping Down as Reddits Chief" was swiftly replaced by an outright propaganda piece painting Pao as a heroic but embattled warrior for equal rights in the midst of that oppressive white boy's club we call Silicon Valley, wherein she "fell victim" to the overwhelming sexism and racism which is both inherent to the tech scene and rampant among the vile Reddit userbase. Of course nothing could be further from the truth, yet an "op-ed" label somehow escaped this nakedly biased writeup.  In reality, Ellen Pao "fell victim" only to her own poor decisions, her own incompetence, her court-documented history of abusing coworkers and subordinates (male and female), her and her husband's shady grifter past of long-cons and frivolous discrimination suits seeking outrageous payoffs, her being completely out-of-touch with the very community she was brought in to manage, her intentionally vague and widely reviled initiative to transform all of Reddit into a so-called "safe space" (despite years of drastic increases in censorship across almost all of Reddit), her brazen double-standards in applying said policy to ban specific subreddits while leaving many more hateful, toxic, and rule-breaking subreddits untouched, her lack of desire to use Reddit or even understand how it works (in one celebrated instance, she actually tried linking to a message from her own inbox, like a boss), her off-site PR campaigns in defense of her bad decisions and policies on places like Buzzfeed (reviled by many Redditors) rather than engaging directly with the Reddit community (as challenging as that may be), her callous sacking of popular employees such as /u/kickme444 who ran Reddit's yearly secret santa gift exchange and was reportedly terminated *because he had leukemia... even though he was able to work* (he later deleted his story and said he'd only discuss it with Reddit Inc, so it would seem that Pao's legal team intimidated him into shutting up), and last but certainly not least her reply at a company meeting that "you'll have to pry this position from my cold, dead hands" upon being asked how the search for a permanent CEO was going (as alleged by another former employee). This list actually goes on and on; this was really just a high-level overview to illustrate what an incredible human being she is and what an amazing job she did as the interim CEO of an online community that was anathema to her.  In a word, Ellen Pao was nothing short of antithetical to the core values that Reddit and its community were founded upon and have historically espoused, as Pao herself hinted at when she announced her depature:   gt; "So why am I leaving? Ultimately, the board asked me to demonstrate higher user growth in the next six months than I believe I can deliver while maintaining reddits core principles."  Although Pao succeeded in alienating the vast majority of regulars that populate the site during her brief stint as CEO, the casus belli leading to her ultimate downfall was her sudden firing of Victoria Taylor, a universally beloved Reddit admin and crucial point of contact for moderators when conducting AMAs. The unexpected and flippant dismissal of Victoria for undisclosed but much-conjectured reasons triggered a sitewide revolt led by the site's moderators, who shutdown most major subreddits in protest of her firing, all culminating in a change.org petition for her ouster skyrocketing from 10k signatories over a few months to over 200k in just as many days. The majority of these moderators are very (if not radically) progressive, often to the point of being called "social justice warriors," meaning it's richly disingenuous to attribute Pao's departure to the clamor of right-wing trolls.  But none of that matters one wit because as everyone knows, Redditors hate nothing so much as they hate women and minorities (except fatties, perhaps). I mean seriously, have you even seen some of the vile names of those awful subreddits they let fester there?! Because if you haven't, the media will remind you of their names, again, and again, and again, as if these purposefully provocative subreddits, whose simmering popularity is first and foremost a result of ever-increasing censorship everywhere else, suddenly represent Reddit if and when anyone from an officially-sanctioned victim class waving a flag of ideological jihad comes under fire for being a world-class shitheel.  Never mind that what set off the final firestorm was the termination of a *female* employee. All of this hate couldn't possibly have anything to do with Pao's shady past, or her shady husband, or her terrible judgement, or her detested policies, or her nasty behavior, or her callous firings, or her ideological hubris, or her embrace of censorship, or her double-standards, or her lack of empathy and communication, or her awful leadership, or a staggering number of other failures. No, it couldn't possibly be any of that because as always, **narrative uber alles**. Now that Ellen Pao has been called a bunch of mean names by an army of anonymous trolls, we're stuck in the "poor Ellen" room, and neither her shady past nor her failures as interim CEO bear repeating nor need be scrutinized.  It's therefore a foregone conclusion that Redditors hated Pao because of her race and her gender and because she was a "fighter of sexism" who became "a hero to many." But what did this "hero" accomplish for women exactly? If firing rockstar female employees, banning salary negotiations, screening job candidates for ideological purity, imposing intentionally vague policies of censorship, and exhibiting all the hallmarks of a Harvard-league grifter before losing a $160 million "landmark" discrimination suit is somehow sufficient cause to be lauded as a brave crusader for social justice in the hallowed tradition of Martin Luther King and Susan B. Anthony, then our brave new world is in very big trouble.  Just how and why Reddit's board of directors selected such an inexperienced, ill-suited lightning-rod for mass-hatred to impose overwhelmingly unpopular site changes during a mere handoff period is anyone's best guess, but what we do know is that the seemingly appalling reactions to Pao's brief reign were anticipated well in advance by most reasonable and knowledgable observers of the situation. What's even worse is that the author of the original NYT article actually sallied forth into /r/KotakuInAction, that villainous hivemind of #gamergate misogynerds, ostensibly to conduct his own AMA, wherein he proceeded to dodge every upvoted question challenging the veracity of his  lt;cough gt; narrative due to these aforementioned pesky facts and inconvenient truths, none of which somehow made it into the revised version of his article:  [I'm Mike Isaac, the New York Times Reporter covering Reddit. AmA.](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3cur16/im_mike_isaac_the_new_york_times_reporter/?sort=top)  As you can see, the NYT wasn't even remotely interested in publishing the truth. In all likelihood, this so-called journalist merely stopped in to troll for hate speech and retreated upon finding himself incapable of inciting any salacious tidbits fit to be plastered over his next edition of agitprop masquerading as journalism. But that's just supposition, meaning it's something I would never publish as fact unless I were, you know, a journalist for the New York Times.  But wait, there's more! Here are some other shining examples of unvarnished journalistic integrity, starting with the highly esteemed Guardian:  [Reddit chief Ellen Pao resigns after receiving 'sickening' abuse from users](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/10/ellen-pao-reddit-interim-ceo-resigns)  [How Ellen Pao lost her job but survived Reddit's swamp of trolls](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/12/ellen-pao-reddit-trolls-feminist-silicon-valley)  The Financial Times:  [Pao quits Reddit after attacks on her leadership](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e833f86e-274b-11e5-9c4e-a775d2b173ca.html)  The London Evening Standard:  [Reddit chief Ellen Pao quits after 'sickening' abuse and death threats from users](http://www.standard.co.uk/news/techandgadgets/reddit-chief-ellen-pao-quits-over-sickening-abuse-and-death-threats-from-users-10382305.html)  ZDNet.com:  [Reddit CEO Ellen Pao resigns after week of 'sickening' attacks](http://www.zdnet.com/article/reddit-ceo-ellen-pao-resigns-under-fire/)  DailyBeast (op-ed):  [Reddits Terrorists Have Won: Ellen Pao and the Failure to Rebrand Web 2.0](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/07/11/reddit-s-terrorists-have-won-ellen-pao-and-the-failure-to-rebrand-web-2-0.html)  Credit where credit is due though, NPR surprisingly ran a [relatively even-handed piece](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/07/10/421877979/ellen-pao-out-as-reddit-ceo). Let's just hope it stays that way.  Now I'm not saying that Pao didn't receive a huge outpouring of crude and spiteful messages, which she clearly did. But somehow I never saw any of these supposed death threats. Yes, there were some death wishes, but let's not conflate "eat shit and die" with "I'll murder you and your family." Such fine details, unfortunately, didn't deter Sam Altman of Reddit's board of directors from dutifully and publicly shaming the Reddit community over their supposed death threats, as though hate mail to polarizing figures in the public eye is unheard of, and as if any would-be murderers reading his patronizing bromide could be dissuaded from sending death threats in the first place. But of course that was not the point of his handwringing exercise in public relations.  Altman's finger-wagging screed in hand, the media had all it needed to run with the narrative that Redditors are literally terrorists, ie. #gamerate redux. And boy did they run. All of these histrionic hyperbolae and identity politics and psychodramas are part and parcel of the media's stock in trade, which is why all of this was predicted well in advance by those following the situation, many of whom are by now all too familiar with its played-out professional victim routine. Manufactured outrage and clueless moral panic from the mainstream media are nothing new to those of us who have lived and breathed old-school internet culture most of our lives. We never forgive and we never forget such classics as: *DOOM caused Columbine. Anonymous: hackers on steroids. Over 9000 penises. Pool's closed. The hacker known as 4chan. #Gamergate*. And so on, and so forth, and so the dragon must be slain over and over and over again, even in our present, supposedly internet-savvy age. Most disturbing of all is that with each manic news cycle, the dragon only grows larger, nastier, and more adept at dividing our society against itself to devour piecemeal both our liberties and our capacity for meaningful and authentic dialog.  https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3d4w47/opinion_narrative_engineering_101/

Shostakovich, String Quartet No. 3, Op. 73  Cailin Quartet:  Clara Bk, violin  Sophia Bk, violin  Stine Hasbirk, viola  Therese strand, cello.  1.Allegretto  2.Moderato con moto  3.Allegro non troppo  4.Adagio   5.Moderato.  **Dmitri Shostakovich, 1906-1975**  **String Quartet No. 3, F major, Op. 73, 1946**  Just after World War II, Shostakovich, then forty, turned once again from his public orchestral music to his private chamber music, composing his String Quartet No. 3 in F major, Op. 73. While he had already written nine symphonies, Shostakovich was just settling into his emerging series of string quartets that would eventually comprise fifteen quartets written throughout his mature life, including some of his very last compositions. Many feel that the String Quartet No. 3 is among is his best quartets; it was a favorite of the composer himself.  It shows Shostakovich in his full powers as a chamber music composer, skillfully deploying the string quartet to express his utterly distinctive musical personality. From a technical standpoint, the quartet, like many of his later quartets, features an astonishing range of textures, sonic effects and brilliant part writing in the service of music with startling emotional and psychological impact. Successful as abstract musical expression on the one hand, it is nearly impossible to miss the topical and programmatic nature of the quartet, another aspect common to most of Shostakovich's chamber music.  The unspeakable hardships of life in the Soviet Union up through the end of WWII took their toll on Shostakovich: nervous, bitter and depressed, he found his most profound outlet in the safe privacy and intimate expressive capability of chamber music. String Quartet No. 3 is a particularly powerful example.
