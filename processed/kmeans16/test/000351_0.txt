And is anyone else kind of, dare I say it, glad that those particular subreddits were banned?
Actually I think the U.S. probably teaches better grammar than the UK. Most UK students can use the English language but don't understand it (myself included).
I know of a store that has had a "sale" on for over 6 months now. People think they're making huge savings and it pisses me off so much cos the price has never actually been reduced.   In fact, does anyone know if this legal in the UK? I'd love for Trading Standards to stumble across this one.
Improve your public speaking skills in Reading!   Hi everyone,  My name is Josh and am the current Vice President of Membership at Reading Speakers Club. The club is part of an international speaking organisation called Toastmasters International (NOT the guys in the red coats, don't worry) and we're always on the look out for new members who want to improve their public speaking/leadership skills in a safe, supportive environment.  I personally joined the club last year and I can't believe the progress that I've made in such a short time - 9 months ago I was on the verge of being diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, but thanks to the confidence I gained at this club I'm now happier than ever. Its a very rare thing for a person to make permanent and genuine change in themselves, but every month I witness more and more people growing in confidence and becoming truly talented speakers at this club.  I just wanted to put the word out there that this club exists, as it is not always well publicised. Our next meeting is at 7:30pm, Monday 6th July at Salisbury Conservative Club (near Cemetery Junction).  Please feel free to come along as a guest and see if this club is for you. It's a great group of people who are all really fun, supportive and willing to go the extra mile to help you.   PM me for more details or visit the website https://www.toastmasters.org/
You have a completely valid point. But a good reason not to write God off is that it can be comforting to think that maybe there's more to life than what we immediately realise. Even if it's a lie that I tell myself, it's a harmless lie that only serves to make me happier. I understand that this is illogical and understand why many people can't make the same decision I have, but it works for me.
I think Americans do this as sport.
Hey Joe
Hi Jstbcool  First of all, thanks for your incredibly well structured and thought out response. It's rare to see that on the internet!  I'm surprised I missed the effect sizes and it's definitely something that we need to be aware of, you make a very good point. In fact one of the things that stood out for me in this paper is the fact that they computed their required sample size a-priori in terms of power. It's refreshing to see people embracing the "new statistics".  I didn't mean to suggest that the participants played 8 hours of luminosity straight. However, having participated in a lot of Psychology experiments myself I felt I could speculate pretty accurately as to which of the two trials would be more tiring. Portal 2 is likely to be much more engaging and most importantly, fun. I think this would affect participants attitudes towards the testing as a whole, particularly with regards to motivation. Motivation is something we take for granted in Psychology a lot and I would hazard a guess that it will have had an effect even in the testing phase.  My third point stems from the reading I've done into the effects of nutrition on cognition. Nutrition is a pretty fascinating subject because there are huge pitfalls in a lot of the research and these are often worsened once cognitive testing is brought into the mix. It's not uncommon in this field of research for a cognitive benefit to be apparent on the day of testing, but to have disappeared once tested again a few weeks later. But, in defence of this study, it is a good starting point for further research to explore longer term effects.   If this study can be replicated, it'd be interesting in the future to work out exactly what aspects of Portal 2 are causing the cognitive benefit. It's extremely difficult to break down the components of such a complicated game, especially as it wasn't designed to be a brain training device. I get the impression that dedicated brain-training games are simple because developers attempt to make them evidence-based. By jumping in with Portal 2 we've almost worked in the opposite direction; we have a game that may cause a cognitive benefit, but we have no idea what the mechanics are which make this happen.
When I washed dishes for a living the head chef suggested the "pissing cow" technique. Stand with your legs as far apart as possible and you'll be a lot lower.
I find they're really helpful. All of the unpleasant feelings that you have at the moment are based on what is going to happen in the future. If you practice meditation or mindfulness you can start to focus yourself to be in the moment, and speaking from experience this is a huge release. It helps you release that at any moment you can get away for these horrible feelings if you need to.  Do you have a smart phone? There's an app I could recommend, if not I can have a quick look for some online sources

I forgot I'd subscribed to this sub and thought /r/showerthoughts had gotten really deep!  But you make a fascinating point and I think I agree with you, whether or not I'm happy about it is another thing entirely.

Goodbye xbox live membership!
That bit was awesome! But who was the strange orphan boy that followed him everywhere??
I've just bought a slide, what should I learn?   After watching "it might get loud" last night and watching Jimmy Page, Edge and Jack White do an awesome bit of slide improv I headed straight out today to get a slide.  Anybody got any good song recommendations for me to learn? And perhaps more importantly are there any drills I should practice with it?
