awesome!
what strength, amazing...

well, the three best beers were goose island at target field, leinenkrugel in milwaukee and it was 103 in texas, so while I don't remember what I drank, it was pretty damn tasty at the time!
early next year for sure, dodger stadium is certainly one I'm looking forward to seeing, cheers
yep, that's how they roll
perfect, heading there next wednesday, I'll take you up on that advice, cheers!
A beer in every park. 23 down, 7 to go

very nice actually, big difference was texture and how much better it was to store bought sausage
whoa
