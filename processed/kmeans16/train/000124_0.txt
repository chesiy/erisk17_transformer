Just one Bernie, just one!
To clarify, the first pic compared to last pic is your progress? And what weight did you start at? Plus, what are your goals?  If so, and your goal of to get big and cut, yes, it's bad progress. Really bad. You may have defined out a bit, but you need to get significantly bigger so bulking is a must. It seems you don't have the diet in order at all. You need to eat at a large caloric surplus to gain weight and it doesn't look like you have been doing that. Simply just working out doesn't cut it, diet is just as vital as training. So I think you just need to her serious about your diet.
Do some lifting and get toned. Looking great
Oh c'mon.
I think it's bc the pictures aren't the best, Selfies are an art. Other than minor skin issues you're fine. If I saw you in real life I'd be throwin out my cheesiest pick up lines.
Holy shit.
It was SWAT on Turf. H2.   We had an alliance, red and blue working together to destroy the gold menace. Then... it happened. You shot me.    I cri evrytim
Awesome. Thanks man. I'll take this into account.
file browser is a necessity.   343 is denying me a basic halotural right that Bungie would have bestowed upon me as soon as I broke that clear plastic film with a knife and gently slid my disk in to my Xbox one to experience the n**BR**vana.   I could be tagging pictures and maps with g4y, I'd out BR you, bush d1d 9/11, and phagit just like the glory days.
That was absolutely incredible. After reading the lines from H3 terminals, it just screams the old plan of "humans were forerunners".  So to sum this up a bit more. Humanity is facing:   - Rebellion and dissent within its military and outer colonies  - Flood's possible return. And in heavy numbers  - Jul and Halsey (whom are both hellbent on revenge) have the Janus key and every piece of forerunner tech.   - plus, a fuckton of Promethean knights at their disposal and the manipulative covie religion is on the rise.   - John is AWOL at a time that is arguably **more threatening then the human covie war**. Humanities greatest hero abandoned them when they needed him most.
I think he's gotten better. Especially with Mr Pokefile on his team. 343 puts little nuggets and easter eggs in trailers so him analyzing can be a good thing.  It just pisses me off when he pronounces mjolnir as "manuer".
Same. It's so nonchalant.
Karen Gillan was in doctor who from 2010-2012. Looked like a young adult on the show and had a husband, I feel like she'd be to old and out of place for a student
- HCS is rising and the competitive scene is beginning to rise again - Lore has been handled wonderfully with books, comics, and merch. - Halo is gaining more content creators, YouTubers, and fan sites. Compared to the dying of Reach and 4 - Halo 5 is looking extremely promising so far. From a story perspective and MP - MCC is functional, 343 is working around the clock to bring the next TU. - no longer is this sub and every halo forum filled with anti 343 circle jerk. We are seeing discussion, awesome clips and more.   Halo isn't dad. We just have to accept that halo isn't the top dog mainstream game anymore. And work to be a friendly community newcomers want to be apart of.
I could remove myself the situation, but it wouldn't make logical sense to do so. My issue isn't with paying taxes altogether, it's when the government spends it on stupid shit that detriments the nation. I shouldn't have to move to a third world country to avoid paying the money the government uses to blow billions of dollars.   What he is saying is like saying: "if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear"
(Xbox One) Ninth Imperial Mandate   Halo and destiny clan. If you need people to do the raid, strikes or nightfall, we are creating a group for it. We will be running MCC as well when it comes out.  The criteria is to be mature, intelligent and at least lvl 25.  www.bungie.net/en/clan/Xbox/574683
