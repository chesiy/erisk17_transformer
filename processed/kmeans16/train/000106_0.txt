Er, is the top post on Reddit really of a man playing a Gameboy and a woman reading a book? This is the most interesting thing on the Internet today? Guess I'll go outside!
The more attention this comment gets, it becomes statistically more and more likely that it will be read by both yourself and a person you will one day fall in love with, but you haven't met yet. You might not meet for years, long after you both happened to read this comment. So smile, you are sharing a moment with someone special to you :)
I don't care who you are, or where you're from, but the first time you get a full-frontal blast of David Gilmour laying his guts down in 'Hey You' from 'The Wall' is a moment you will never forget.  The only other moment of musical ecstasy that approaches it, in my opinion, is Funkadelics 'Maggot Brain'. If you haven't heard it go grab the best headphones you can find, sit in a darkened room, maybe light a few candles, and play that shit load

The moutain in your picture is not Mount Everest, it is an entirely seperate mountain called Ama Dablam. It is in the same range as Everest, but hugely smaller. [Here is a photo I took last time I was there of Everest, Lohtse and Dablam.](http://imgur.com/B4HWHCN.jpg) Note: Dablam was a great deal closer to me in relation to Everest and Lohtse when I took the picture, they are a lot further away than they look. Only the pyramid summit of Everest is visible, and from some angles Everest is roughly pyramid shaped, especially from the east, assuming this picture is a sunrise.  **EDIT:** u/skatelinsy has edited his comment using my picture. This doesn't illustrate his point very well, as only the summit pyramid of Everest is visible on the far left. Lohtse is the peak to the right of Everest and Ama Dablam is on the far right of the picture
Wait, the charge of the light brigade was a historical event? I always thought it was a poetic allegory, or Tennyson was using a fictitious event as a moral exemplar for pre-great war british children, not a documentable historical fact.  Also, I hate to be the one to point this out, but if this were an authentic battlefield there would be a lot more debris than just a few cannonballs. Not saying this isn't genuine, just it might be fair to assume this was either a very selective and pre-organised photograph, or it was taken some considerable time after the event.

Your comment made me sad and happy at the same time! So sorry to hear about your friends dog, but glad these little squirmers cheered you up a bit! They are adorable, and it is my job to look after them and put on their little puppy-sweaters! It's the perfect job!
Thanks Sickipedia
That is the sort of drivel that only the indoctrinated would resort to in a debate, so this shall probably be my last entry. You just confirmed it, the church pushes us mere mortals to be beyond 'human nature'. What a despicable thing to say, surely you can see the faulty logic for yourself? I will repeat my argument, if you believe in the Catholic God you believe in a deity that created us sick, and *commanded* us to be well. Condoms will not cure the virus, nor will they heal those afflicted, but they will prevent millions of otherwise healthy, normal people from contracting the condition and the virus today would a fraction of the epidemic that it is. These are not statistics we are arguing about, these are human lives. Millions of fully aware, fully sentient human beings have died a humiliating, painful death because of the stigma placed on condoms by religious bodies. How can this be the lesser of two evils?   Please, consider the problem for yourself and do your own thinking before regurgitation the garbage you have been dictated in church. You can make your own mind up on these matters, to think for yourself makes us human, to blindly agree makes us cattle. Make your choices.
This might seem like a strange one, but countries would certainly not exist if the everyone thought like me. After all, what is a country but another reason to form prejudice, wether positive or negative, over a perfect stranger. Try to image in it: No war, no dispute in the middle east, no conflicting militaries, no unrepresentative governments, no taxes, no restrictions upon travellers, no ruling class, no dictatorships, no reason to hate a person you have never met (other than religious grounds, but lets leave /r/atheism where it is). This is not to say that local cultures, languages, traditions and customs should be abandonded or assimilated, they should not. This is more akin to allowing people to be governers of their own destiny, and to not be collateral in political affairs. This, in my most humble opinion, is where Marx went wrong.  Inb4: John Lennon
Thank you, it certainly was an awesome experience, but instead of envying me, emulate me! If I can do it on such a small budget and at such an age, anyone can! Its is worth giving consideration to, and I would be happy to offer any advice!
Nah its not more expensive, it all depends on how you do it! If you are willing to sacrifice **ALL** your creature comforts it can be done quite cheap, depends where you go!  The most remote place I reached was tiny isolated mountain villages in the Himalayas, one called Khumjung and another called Tengbouche, which has a famous monastery. It was a wonderful place to be, the scenery was just beyond imagination, it was breathtaking (literally as there was only 30% normal O2 levels at times!)  Visas are easy to sort out, the only countries I visited that demand visas in advance were India ($60 US in advance) and Viet Nam ($40 USD in advance) Usually just showing up on the border and bribing the border police works (I once had to bribe the same border guard twice on the border between Viet Nam and Laos!) I have a british passport which is still well respected, its not hard to sort visas out. The only thing is if you have an Israeli stamp in your passport a lot of Arab countries will not allow you a visa, so watch out for that!   Language barriers are easy, you simply learn a few useful phrases like hello, thank you, yes, no etc but english is a universal tongue, most people will understand what you are saying if you are patient.  My emigration process to New Zealand has been fairly smooth, although they have just changed the rules, I'm not sure what it's like now. I have a University Degree which makes things easier.
Tough one to answer! I broke a bone in my foot and was stuck in Wanaka, New Zealand for a few weeks on crutches and could not have been happier. So happy in fact I emigrated to New Zealand! If you haven't been to New Zealand, go for the good of your soul, especially South Island! Other than that, I spent some time deep in the Himalayas which was an incredible experience, and northern Viet nam, also an awesome place and awesome people!!
