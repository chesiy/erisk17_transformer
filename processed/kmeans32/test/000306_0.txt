LPT : Add '/?gl=US' to the YouTube URL to avoid seeing the cringeworthy NSFW videos on the front page   I see that a lot of you face this problem, based on [this earlier post](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3dhnmo/there_something_seriously_wrong_with_youtube/).  Adding the '/?gl=US' will set your country to US. If you are using the YouTube app instead, just go to the settings and change your country to Worldwide. This should work.
Wow. I hardly even blinked while watching this episode.   IMO, this was the best episode yet. So much stuff to absorb that I'll probably have to watch it two more times for it to completely sink in. This show is totally on par with GOT and other amazing shows on my top 5 list.
This is interesting.
Fucking advertisement! Ahh

This happened in episode one, when Elliot was following that Michael Hansen dude who was dating his therapist.  [I made a previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MrRobot/comments/3c0nlv/i_think_this_scene_makes_it_super_clear_whos_real/) noting how when Mr Robot is talking to the fsociety team, it's clearly Elliot they are talking to.  And even in the bartender scene, you can clearly see how the dude doesn't even look at Mr. Robot.  This is the only scene till now where Mr Robot had a clear interaction with someone which did not involve Elliot.

Are you Elliot's father? From Mr. Robot?
Reddit Is Revolting
I also have that doubt. Tyrell has a good understanding of Tech. He is smart. He already knew Elliot's name. He doesn't say anything about Elliot's switch of files. And he invites him to the board meeting. Even if he is not an imagination of Elliot, he probably does have some significance in his life.

Dude, that was amazing. I subscribed in hope of seeing more from you.

I must be bored too to keep this going, but.. 1. I mentioned milk from cows. Would have been better if you world have read my original comment in the first place. You are taking one single example and expanding it into a debate.  2. We humans still do not contribute to spreading their seeds when we have their fruits.  3. I'm not trying to contradict you. I agree with what you said about hurting and killing animals being unnecessary. The point I'm trying to make is there is more to it than you think. And that, in the grand scheme of things, none of it really matters.
ITT: skeptic people drawing unnecessary conclusions without doing any research. FreeCodeCamp is not a spam, it's legit. There are no bots in this trend, just people who are not so regular on Reddit. Go ahead and [read this article by the founder of FCC from a few months ago](http://blog.freecodecamp.com/2014/11/a-cautionary-tale-of-learning-to-code.html).  This was the article that got me and many others started with FreeCodeCamp. And I found this article on Reddit ([r/programming](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/2msdo1/a_cautionary_tale_of_learning_to_code/), [r/learnprogramming](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2muc12/cautionary_tale_about_learning_to_code/), [r/learnjavascript](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/2mknfp/a_cautionary_tale_of_learning_to_code_my_own/)).   And, yes, the curriculum links to other free learning resources on the web like CodeCademy, but we also have the Ziplines and Basejumps and Bonfires for practice, which we entirely built on our own. And we also have plans to build our own learning tools in the future.   I agree the title could have been a little less click-bait-ish, but trust me, FreeCodeCamp is legit and we would be glad to have you as part of the community. :)
