I'm not harping on about official videos  fair enough. Maybe i should have directed it at the OP.  I'm just a bit wary of a sentiment I see emerging on here that the nature of the source is important.  People have virtually stopped sharing current video clips in recent weeks and I blame it on a mild jerk about sticking to the official stuff.   I just said that I don't think it is.  The link here is definitely the official youtube of the battle bot creators.   You can see it link from :  http://battlebots.com/  https://www.facebook.com/battlebots  https://www.twitter.com/battlebots  https://www.youtube.com/user/battlebots etc.    Thankfully, the battlebot creators are good enough to make their stuff avialable to all countries.  abc who bought the series do their own marketing and have their own youtube, twitter etc complementing it.      https://www.youtube.com/user/ABCNetwork  https://twitter.com/battlebotsabc
All those other subreddits are independent of this one.  They can offer different content and a different pace. They are all worth subscribing to and contributing to.    (more related subreddit are listed in the sidebar )  I can only speak for what this subreddit is trying to do and offer.  There is a great community here thanks to the momentum of the TV show but the common interest is way beyond a tv show and that is what I have always defined this community around.
Interesting to see the branding develop.  They dropped the "RE" bit completely.  RE was an HTC product line.  Still there on the older website logo which was around when this subreddit was made http://www.htcvr.com/
ok no worries. I don't like it because it doesn't fit reddit rules of personal information and encourages people to investigate someone who might not want attention or a discussion about them about them.  e.g. There are plenty of people who are pissed off with the battlebots live experience so far.   https://www.reddit.com/rules/  I left it for a week but it was slowly bothering me for the moderation standard it would set.   So it stays removed.   If people with battlebots associations want to start discussions about their experiences under their real name that would be cool.  Similar to /r/IAMA with vertification.  Maybe better to do it on /r/IAMA and link to it from here
/r/battlebots is a community for fans of Battlebots, robot combat and the wider world of the world of competitive robotics.
The way I see it, they are giving away access to their limited internet because that is of benefit to their advertising business.  It will lead to monoplies and undesirable stuff if left unchecked in the long term.  However, in the short term it is a finacially viable way of giving internet access to the poor.  They would not fund internet.org if there wasn't some stong benefit for them.

Why Comcast and Time Warner must be stopped: The corporate mega-merger that threatens American democracy
While your OP   is certainly aired in jest, I honestly believe we are in the midst of history in the making. While trying to avoid buying into hype and grandeur, let me elaborate a moment.  We've all read some writings from Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton (this guy is a true hero), Ben Franklin, Thomas Paine, John Adams (no less a hero, ironically HATED Hamilton), etc on these very topics. Similar was their plight and equal was their discontent, though it would inevitably grow much stronger nearer the Revolution itself. Their established, respected government encroached upon their fundamental rights. It was nothing new then, it's nothing new now.  Having watched the video, I am unable to separate them it from those letters and well known quotables from patriots long gone. Granted, no one is asking for revolution, at least, no one of any sense. But the fact remains that one day these silly little sketches from from a silly show finding their way to a website like may find their way into the textbooks text-tablets of our grandchildren. Will they speak of an evil, failed coup to cripple the Government's (No doubt by then the word will carry a capital G while the word "god" will not) enforcement of the law? Or will they be the words of activists who fought for human rights against an overreaching body?   For all of our sakes, for our children's sakes, I sincerely hope it is the latter. May changes to policy, and more importantly, the world's attitude towards these issues, come swiftly and peacefully.  Let me pre-empt the critics.  Yes  some are reluctant to compare Snowden to the likes of Jefferson and Franklin. Please do not misunderstand. I know it's a big jump, but I don't see it as immediately inappropriate. Americans hold certain historical figures up high as a manner of culture. They deserve our respect and gratitude, but in truth they were humans who spoke up in their times. They were farmers, business men, lawyers. Both sets (activists then and now) committed treason in the name of human rights, and that is to be respected.  Now, we do not need a new bill with his face on it or anything. My position is simply that these events and issues will undoubtedly be marked in history, and that Snowden has had no small part in it.   #NSALookAtMyDick may well be an important chapter and history in the making.

Europes Net Neutrality Sense. Its Internet could soon be more competitive than Americas.   You know Washington is on the wrong track with a regulation when even Brussels has a better idea. Witness the latest net-neutrality proposal from European Union leaders, which is smarter than the 300-page blobfish recently imposed by President Obamas Federal Communications Commission.  In response to demands from the European Parliament for net-neutrality regulations, EU member governments are discussing a Latvian plan that would leave the marketplace scope to set rates for different types of data transmission. While the proposal from the governments would require Internet-service providers to equally treat equivalent types of traffic when providing internet access servicesa big nod to proponents of net neutralityit would also allow providers to enter into agreements with content companies to ensure a specific level of service quality.  This isnt a full-throated commitment to letting market forces work on the European Internet. It would be better if the EU werent imposing any new rules on the telecommunications industry. Nevertheless, the provision opens the door to differential pricing, the bane of the net-neutrality crowd but potentially an important market tool for stimulating future investment.  Its also a major improvement on what the FCC did last month when it applied early-20th-century utility rules to the Internet. The key insight in Europe is that there needs to be some market involvement in pricing. The European proposal also waters down a plan to further limit the roaming charges mobile operators charge customers using services outside their home countries. Roaming already is subject to Brussels-imposed price caps, and the European Parliament and Commission are agitating to ban roaming charges.  Any final regulation will need to survive the European Parliament, where support for activist regulation is stronger. What Europe really needs to boost investment and pro-consumer competition would be a single market for telecommunications services, coupled with more reasonable antitrust enforcement to allow the consolidation Europes telecom market so sorely lacks.  Still, this climb down on net neutrality raises the prospect that the EU could end up with a more pro-investment business climate than the U.S. Not everyone wants to follow Washingtons lead in tightening governments grip on the Internet.  ------------  From http://www.wsj.com/articles/europes-net-neutrality-sense-1426030850 (paywall)

The article/comment....  (It isn't that sort of website where traffic matters as there are no adverts)  ----------------------------   So, the SpaceX hype turned out to be just that. An altogether more prosaic investment was announced to fund core operations.   SpaceX, currently embroiled in a court case with its benefactor the US government which elected to give SpaceX no part of a recent $11bn launch order (http://spacenews.com/42882filing-suggests-jurisdictional-challenge-in-spacex-lawsuit-against-us ) and on the heels of a recently crashed launch, needed cash. This investment is about funding its core operations, not about initiating some fantasy global satellite constellation about which no mention is made.   Google (who made no comment) are named alongside Fidelity as investors, but no amount is given. So, it could be the Google Charitable Foundation, and it could be $1 for all we know. Fidelity invests for a living.   Also, in typically cryptic fashion, no terms are mentioned. Ordinary shares, convertible loans, preference shares, exploding warrants, covenants and targets ?   The uninformative Spacex website merely has the text below, making it clear that proceeds are to fund continued innovation in the areas of space transport, reusability, and satellite manufacturing i.e. the core business was running out of money, and no mention of fleets of satellites.   Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) has raised a billion dollars in a financing round with two new investors, Google and Fidelity. They join existing investors Founders Fund, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Valor Equity Partners and Capricorn. Google and Fidelity will collectively own just under 10% of the company.   SpaceX designs, manufactures, and launches the worlds most advanced rockets and spacecraft. This funding will be used to support continued innovation in the areas of space transport, reusability, and satellite manufacturing.   Incredibly, newspspers of record like The Times reported last night the rumours, not the facts SpaceX is a private company and thus is subject to no stock market rules about truthful or complete press releases. Google made no announcement, suggesting nothing material has happened

This is still a very bad move on Marriot's part. Unlike ISPs, they do not have a monopoly for overpriced short term lease agreements in almost all of the markets they're in.

* "Don't tense up with the cold wind - relax, no really, relax, let it pass through you." It was very Jedi, and it works... I just have to remember it, because it's a reflex to tense up in the cold.   * For the sake of the environment/your wallet, you DON'T need to leave the heat on all the way when you leave the house. DO leave it on a little bit, though. I generally turn it to about 10 degrees Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit). When you come home, turn it back up, put some new warm socks on and keep your sweater and hat on until it's warm again.  * When it's very cold outside, or you are leaving the house for a few days, you may need to leave the faucets running a little bit so they don't freeze up.  * Get plastic sheeting to insulate your windows, you essentially shrink-wrap it with a hairdryer and it creates a bubble of air that will block any drafts.  * Use thick curtains, but open them while the sun is out to let the heat in.  * Keep your doors closed inside the house.  * Make or buy draft stoppers from fabric and dense filling and put them at the base of your doors and windows.  * Cook a lot! Make sure you have proper ventilation for boiling, sauteing, etc. because the steam will cool down and it will actually be counterproductive. Baking is best, and after you bake leave the oven door open to let the heat escape into the room.
It would be wonderful if Comcast did pursue someone trying to make customer service complaints public.   Just think of the negative reaction on reddit and elsewhere and how it would unite people on behalf of the victim.    I think if the privacy of the customer agents is respected ... i.e. leaving out their name, then there is no good reason for Comcast to try and use the small words of a contract against you.  then again, they are evil
Is it not completely logical that they would do something like this?  Do you really think that the military would allow users to browse the internet using IP addresses traceable to geolocations ?  It could be used by an enemy to give away the position of their troops and other useful intelligence.  There are countless other security reasons that they would route military internet traffic through central hubs on a VPN and not just allow everyone to connect direct using the local ISP.    I'm not precluding anything dodgy going on but the explanation given is a reasonable basis on which to start theories.
Russia needs the oil price to increase to avoid bankruptcy. Russia needs a war in the middle east?   This is one way I see them of handling the crisis.  Not seen many develop the theory.  However, ideas and rumours are making it to the news  * [Russia Plotting To start war on Israel - Plan includes shipping missiles to terrorist groups](http://www.wnd.com/2014/12/official-russia-plotting-to-start-war-on-israel)  If not war in the middle east, then some other world event to knock oil prices up.   N Korea?  Anyone else seeing such coverage or ideas?  Some dismiss it as anti-putin propaganda but I think it makes sense for some kind of covert provocation to rattle markets  and increase oil futures.
The U.S. is Urged to Honestly Apologize to Mankind for Its Evil Doing before Groundlessly Pulling up Others      Strange thing that happened in the heart of the U.S., the ill-famed cesspool of injustice, is now afloat in the world as shocking news.  The Sony Pictures Entertainment, the biggest movie producer in the U.S., which produced the undesirable reactionary film "The Interview" daring hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK and agitating even terrorism and had a plan to distribute it, was exposed to surprisingly sophisticated, destructive and threatening cyber warfare and has been thrown into a bottomless quagmire after suffering property losses worth hundreds of millions of dollars.  The public in the U.S. is now describing this case as "disgrace suffered by Sony Pictures Entertainment," "very sorry thing caused by the U.S.," "Sony Pictures Entertainment showing a white flag before hackers" and the "unprecedented disaster suffered by the U.S."  Those who meted out a stern punishment of justice were reported to be cyber experts styling themselves "guardians of peace".  Seized with terrible horror and threat in face of their merciless hacking attack in retaliation against unjust actions, many movie and drama distributors in North America including 41 states of the U.S. and Canada immediately canceled the screening of the reactionary movie. And it was reported that the Sony Pictures Entertainment which directly sponsored its production and distribution hastily issued a statement on Dec. 25 that it would suspend the screening of the undesirable movie which had been planned in 63 countries.  The NDC of the DPRK highly estimates the righteous action taken by the "guardians of peace," though it is not aware of their residence.  It, at the same time, considers as fortunate the step taken by the Sony Pictures Entertainment to give up the overall distribution of the above-said movie due to the decision and strong pressure of the movie and drama distributors for stopping the screening of the reactionary movie, though belatedly.  This is an official stand of the army and the people of the DPRK on what happened in the heart of the U.S.  This stand is taken by the DPRK because the movie "The Interview" is an undesirable and reactionary one justifying and inciting terrorism which should not be allowed in any country and any region.  Another reason is that the movie is run through with a story agitating a vicious and dastardly method of assassinating a head of a legitimate sovereign state.  No wonder, even political and social circles of the U.S. commented that it is quite wrong to defame the head of the state for the mere reason that his politics is different from that of the U.S. and it is in the hostile relationship with the latter and, therefore, the Sony Pictures Entertainment got into a serious trouble and paid a due price.  For these reasons, the DPRK is more highly praising the "guardians of peace" for their righteous deed which prevented in advance the evil cycle of retaliation-- terrorism sparks terrorism.  It is quite natural that the movie and drama producers should refrain from undesirable deeds contrary to the noble mission to lead morality and civilization.  But what matters is that the U.S. and its followers are groundlessly trumpeting that the recent cyber attack was made by the DPRK.  The FBI issued the results of the investigation into the hack at the Sony Pictures Entertainment on December 19.  According to them, it suffered tremendous losses.  One may say this is the due price incurred by wrong deed, the evil act of hurting others.  The U.S. released a statement asserting that this loss was caused by the DPRK.  No matter how big and disgraceful the loss may be, the U.S. should not pull up others for no reason.  The FBI presented a report on the results of technical analysis of hacking program used by the "guardians of peace" for this attack, citing it as the ground that the serious hacking was caused by the DPRK.  The report says the malignant code had access to north Korea's IP already known several times and the hacking methods applied in the "March 20 hacking case" and during cyber warfare against media and various other computer networks in south Korea in recent years are similar to that applied against the Sony Pictures Entertainment this time, being another ground that "this was done by the north".  The report, in particular, adds that the malignant code and algorithm applied during the attack are similar to what was used during the hacking attack on south Korea, citing it as a proof.  Not satisfied with those groundless "evidence", the FBI is letting loose ambiguous remarks that it is hard to fully prove due to the "protection of sensitive information sources."  This means self-acknowledgement that the "assertion about the north's deed" came from an intentional allegation rather than scientific evidence.  It is a common sense that the method of cyber warfare is almost similar worldwide. Different sorts of hacking programs and codes are used in cyberspace.  If somebody used U.S.-made hacking programs and codes and applied their instruction or encoding method, perhaps, the "wise" FBI, too, could not but admit that it would be hard to decisively assert that the attack was done by the U.S.  Moreover, the DPRK has never attempted nor made a "cyber-attack" on south Korea. The rumor about "cyber-attack" by the DPRK was a concoction made by the south Korean puppet regime and its plot.  After all, the grounds cited by the FBI in its announcement were all based on obscure sci-tech data and false story and, accordingly, the announcement itself is another fabrication. This is the DPRK's stand on the U.S. gangster-like behavior against it.  What is grave is that U.S. President Obama is recklessly making the rumor about "DPRK's cyber-attack on Sony Pictures" a fait accompli while crying out for symmetric counteraction, strict calculation and additionally retaliatory sanctions.  This is like beating air after being hit hard. A saying goes every sin brings its punishment with it. It is best for the guilty to repent of its evil doings and draw a lesson when forced to pay dearly for them.  The DPRK has clear evidence that the U.S. administration was deeply involved in the making of such dishonest reactionary movie.  It is said that the movie was conceived and produced according to the "guidelines" of the U.S. authorities who contended that such movies hurting the dignity of the DPRK supreme leadership and inciting terrorism against it would be used in an effective way as "propaganda against north Korea".  The U.S. Department of State's special human rights envoy went the lengths of urging the movie makers to keep all scenes insulting the dignity of the DPRK supreme leadership in the movie, saying it is needed to "vex the north Korean government".  The facts glaringly show that the U.S. is the chief culprit of terrorism as it has loudly called for combating terrorism everywhere in the world but schemed behind the scene to produce and distribute movies inciting it in various countries of the world.  It is not exaggeration to say in the light of the prevailing situation that the U.S. administration and President Obama looking after the overall state affairs of the U.S. have been behind the case.  Can he really cover up the crimes he has committed by trying so hard to falsify the truth and turn white to black.  So we watched with unusual attention what had been done by the "guardians of peace" to avert terrorism and defend justice.  Yet, we do not know who or where they are but we can surely say that they are supporters and sympathizers with the DPRK.  The army and people of the DPRK who aspire after justice and truth and value conscience have hundreds of millions of supporters and sympathizers, known or unknown, who have turned out in the sacred war against terrorism and the U.S. imperialists, the chieftain of aggression, to accomplish the just cause.  Obama personally declared in public the "symmetric counteraction", a disgraceful behavior.  There is no need to guess what kind of thing the "symmetric counteraction" is like but the army and people of the DPRK will never be browbeaten by such a thing.  The DPRK has already launched the toughest counteraction. Nothing is more serious miscalculation than guessing that just a single movie production company is the target of this counteraction. Our target is all the citadels of the U.S. imperialists who earned the bitterest grudge of all Koreans.  The army and people of the DPRK are fully ready to stand in confrontation with the U.S. in all war spaces including cyber warfare space to blow up those citadels.  Our toughest counteraction will be boldly taken against the White House, the Pentagon and the whole U.S. mainland, the cesspool of terrorism, by far surpassing the "symmetric counteraction" declared by Obama.  This is the invariable toughest stand of the army and people of the DPRK.  Fighters for justice including "guardians of peace" who turned out in the sacred drive for cooperation in the fight against the U.S. to defend human justice and conscience and to dismember the U.S. imperialists, the root cause of all sorts of evils and kingpin of injustice, are sharpening bayonets not only in the U.S. mainland but in all other parts of the world.  The just struggle to be waged by them across the world will bring achievements thousands of times greater than the hacking attack on the Sony Pictures Entertainment.  It is the truth and inevitability of the historical development that justice prevails over injustice.  Whoever challenges justice by toeing the line of the biggest criminal U.S. will never be able to escape merciless punishment as it is the target of the sacred drive for cooperation in the fight against the U.S.  The U.S. should reflect on its evil doings that put itself in such a trouble, apologize to the Koreans and other people of the world and should not dare pull up others.
