There's tomato buried somewhere under all that cheese...
Mind absolutely blown.
Are you and I the same person? I started a wish list about a week ago, spent 2 hours one night making it because I was so bored. I only ever talk about baby related stuff; I'm starting to worry if my husband things I'm insane. I'm always reading about how to raise kids and constant worry about being a good mom, which my husband claims is adorable and sweet. I have baby names picked out and often use these names when referring to our future kids (all names are husband approved). So far, I've crocheted 3 baby blankets and one dress in the last month or so and I'm itching to make more baby stuff. I have researched OBGYNs and already know where I want to deliver. I think I need an intervention. Please send help.
How are kids supposed to summon Satan if they don't know how to play Hot Cross Buns?!
Aw, I'm glad I could help! Best of luck to the two of you.
I absolutely love the scarves Claire wears on the show, but haven't gotten around to making one. Beautiful! I'm jealous.
Shame
Wow I see a few from Xavier. Go Muskies! :)
I was a little skeptical about staying there at first since it's a value resort - I feared it would have a cheap motel feel to it and would be too crowded. We stayed at French Quarter last time and I thought Pop wouldn't be as nice. I must say, I like Pop so much more. Despite being in a room on the first floor, it was fairly quiet (we were on an end in the middle of nowhere though so that might be why haha). The grounds were beautiful and the 50s pool was relaxing - a nice escape from the hustle and bustle of Disney. Absolutely amazing value.
I'm not sure if this belongs here... The actor who plays Edmure - Tobias Menzies - recently did an interview, which begins with him talking about GoT and his hope that they eventually tie up Edmure's storyline. I found it funny that he is just as clueless as the fans. [Here's the link](http://www.vulture.com/2015/05/outlander-tobias-menzies-on-going-full-frontal.html) to the interview for those interested.
Touch.
Yay!! We got ours in the mail today. We are leaving May 9th, and I'll be turning 23 while we are there :)
I'm not a professor, but I had the same professor for 5 classes and I know something that always drives him mad. This professor teaches creative writing courses, and every week people turn in rough drafts of their work for the class and professor to critique. Far too often someone says things along the lines of "I finished this right before class" or "I completely forgot my work was due until the last minute, luckily I was able to whip something together." They say these things to fellow classmates and most importantly to the professor. Oh man my professor abhors it. He is extremely passionate about his classes and about writing. Whenever students say stuff like that he takes it as they didn't care about their writing or the class, and it makes him feel like they are wasting his time. I mean, it takes hours to critique the works for each week (for my novel writing class each manuscript was like 20+ pages long) so I totally understand why he is so upset when students act like they didn't care about it, and so blatantly admit that they don't care.
Yay! Congrats!
Be Our Guest - Lunch or Dinner?   Hi all!  My husband and I are going to be in Magic Kingdom on May 11 to celebrate my birthday. We didn't get to experience BoG on our honeymoon, so we're going to this time around. When we booked our vacation, all that was left were lunch reservations, so I got in at 1:15pm. However, I wanted to see if I could get in for dinner because I kind of want my birthday dinner to be sit down and not quick service. I've been stalking the reservation site, but for weeks I've been getting the "Sorry, no reservations are available blah blah blah" message. Imagine my surprised today when TWO reservations appeared! One at 4:05 and one at 8:55. I nabbed the 4:05 time. Now I can't decide if I want to keep the lunch or dinner reservation (we don't we to do both at BoG in one day because that's way too pricey; our second meal will be a quick service, most likely Pecos Bill)  I've been weighing the pros and cons of each. I really like the idea of lunch being cheaper, but I like the dinner options a bit more and I really want to try to meet the Beast. I cannot decide, so I've decide to ask the experts. Those who have experienced BoG, which do you like better - lunch or dinner?
They did it! They did the thing with the window!! Ahhhhhh!!!!
Yep, midnight EST
Stay, with Ewan McGregor and Ryan Gosling.
...and I put the coat on her!
He didn't offer any free samples, just told me to try my mom's first. It was so weird. My husband about lost it when he said pregnancy was a treatment lol.   This guy is supposed to be a migraine specialist. People gave him good reviews on HealthGrade, but he just seemed a bit whacky to me.  I must admit that I was not very prepared for the appointment. I randomly decided to make this appointment one day, and when I called they said "oh, we had a cancellation so we can get you in tomorrow morning!" which means I had less than 24 hours to prepare. I'll definitely be more prepared next time.   Thank you so much for your input.
I tried changing my password to GameofThrones but the error told me it contains too many dead characters.
The lyrics for "By the Way" by the Red Hot Chili Peppers are "con job, boot strap." The first time I heard the song it sounded like he said "Cunt job, boob cat."
The Walking Dead - Still (Season 4, Episode 12).   Absolutely nothing happened - basically an hour of bullshit character development. Most of the episode revolves around Beth wanting alcohol. She's willing to risk her life, and Daryl's too, for her first fucking taste of alcohol. God damn it, Beth, you're in the zombie apocalypse, not a sorority.
Stay classy, Newport.

Ass to ass!

Im sorry, I wasn't trying to speak of it lightly - didn't mean to make kids sound disposable like a puppy or something because kids are serious business. There are some people not meant to have kids, I know that. I'm just asking OP if his wife has ever seriously considered kids and if she has given a legitimate reason for not wanting kids... I mean, it sounds like she would try to take care of a child if she had one by accident so why doesn't she want to have a baby purposely? I'm also curious as to how she hates children since she, as OP claims, has had a limited experience with them (and what is this limited experience, and did the limited experience play a role in her not wanting kids?). I also feel that she's making an excuse when she says she doesn't want kids because she doesn't have maternal instincts since some women, at least as I've seen, can have the instinct kick in once they have a child of their own. I just want to know if there's a hidden reason why she doesn't want kids: saying she hates kids, especially when she doesn't have experience with them, sounds like a sketchy reason to me, but that's just me.   In short, I want to know why the wife won't keep an open mind about kids, why she's so adamant on not wanting them when she hasn't had much experience.   Sorry if I made it sound like she should just have one and pray to god she doesn't hate it because I wasn't trying to say that...   Edit: rearranged things...
As one user has said, colleges tend to care about the money. Often, they don't have souls and don't care about people. My husband took classes over the summer at a local community college a few years back, and he went to the registrar office and asked to have the classes dropped before the deadline. He assumed everything was fine. Then he got a notice saying he owed the school money. Apparently somehow his classes didn't get dropped - his paperwork got lost, so there was no proof he had dropped his classes on time. We were in financial hardship then (and trying to afford a wedding as well). Long story short, regardless of our hardship, he had to pay the school back in full.   Meanwhile, I was attending a very expensive Catholic university. Despite having scholarships and loans, I didn't have enough to cover the cost so my parents paid $5000 out of pocket every semester. My grandmother died suddenly, sending my mom in a deep depression that caused her to stop attending work, which caused my parents to have a lot of money issues. My dad and I filed paperwork to get more loans or some sort of assistance from the university. They denied it.   I'm sorry if this discourages you, but like I said, many universities just don't care.   So here's my advice: try like hell to get the school to understand you are in hardship. Be polite and truthful, and do not accuse the college of being evil or anything. Tears could be beneficial. Maybe you'll get lucky and they will care. Be prepared for the worst though. If you have to pay the money back, try for a loan. Whoever said you should calculate how much those 3.5 hours of class time costs has a good idea, that sounds fair to me, hopefully they could go for that...   Also, take this situation as a life lesson. Be sure you always know what you're getting yourself into, and always know and meet deadlines.  Edit: words
Interesting. The coin is the same on both sides, which made me think it wouldn't be legal tender, but I wasn't sure. Thanks for the information!
As the title says, my parents called today to say they had to put our dog down. Sammie was 16; he would've been 17 in October. My parents gave him to me as a Christmas present when I was 5 years old. Today, I'm 22, married, and about to graduate college, so this dog has been around for a lot of major events in my life. It's like my childhood officially died with him.
