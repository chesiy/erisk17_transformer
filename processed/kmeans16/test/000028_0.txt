Wine enema.
Lemons! Burning candles, weed, some trees after it rains.
No idea sorry, can you try Shazam-ing it?
If you like indie check out The Virgins, they have some very catchy tunes. If you like 80's or 90's real alternative Teenage Fanclub is great (I Don't Know and Don't Look Back are my favorites). But if you want something more current check out Pity Sex they have an album called Feast of Love and a song on it called Drown Me Out. Also Title Fight have a song called Your Pain Is Mine should satisfy your cravings. Please let me know how it works out!

No because I overeat for the most part. And this is assuming I live in a country where a large number of people are hungry so it's not like transporting the food is an issue.
If I eat less, will there be more food for the hungry people in the world?
How's your butt doing?
OOOOOOHHHHH
BASE jumping!
Okay but if it doesn't change temperature as much as air then why does it absorb more energy sometimes (winter) and less energy other times (summer)?
Rude!
You make some good points, but again, if he hadn't done that stuff then he would be dead himself, so he was just making that choice so I think the ends justify the means. I'm no saying he's right, but there has to be some "relatability" to him because he was always put in the situation where he had to make that choice. As for shooting Mike, yes he was wrong in doing that because "he didn't have to". But Mike was willing to kill Walter just a few seasons ago on Gus' orders. I say if someone smites you on one cheek, smash them on the other. I'm not saying the guy was a saint, and after reading all your comments I would venture to change the title of the post to something a little less polarizing, but he didn't deserve everything that happened to him-- and Vince Gilligan always said that Breaking Bad takes place in a moral universe, one where everyone gets what they deserve. My heart broke when everyone he loved turned on him and his family betrayed him and he didn't deserve that because he was a victim.
