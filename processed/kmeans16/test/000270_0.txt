Ham isn't obsolete but it is undergoing a shift. It's always been way more targetted to hackers. Now that the hacker/maker community is growing some interesting developments have been happening. New protocols, space balloons, and software defined radio have not (yet) been made obsolete by the internets.  Then there's Echolink, which is a neat mashup.
Madison H3 Red Dress This Saturday - low risk of being arrested
Charge your phone!
I think it's very funny when people do find it important. There's actually a 13th now, Ophiuchus, because the stars have moved since the Babylonians. Astrologists would know this if they ever looked up. Seriously, if you think the stars contain your fate, look the fuck up once in a while!  Tl;dr: Caring about sign = totally undateable.
FYI, not associated with the project, but it is cool.
Neat photos. Those do look like roots. It almost looks like *Agrobacterium rhizogenes*. That's a bacterium that infects plants and injects DNA into cells. In this case, the cells go a bit rouge and make a bunch of roots. The disease is called "crazy root". No real treatment.
Eh, personal experience. Skaters, more than even pedestrians, seem to have no awareness of their surroundings. Just about three hours ago I almost hit a dude on a board since he was going the wrong way down state and not looking.  On a bike, Peds have right-of-way in all cases except at a controlled intersection. Skaters don't have the same right-of-way.  I'd be pissed if there was a soccer game in the street everyday too. It would impinge on others' fair use of the street.
Bullshit! God's power deceases by the inverse square.
Rapey.
I took it my senior year as a relax class. Holy crap. So good. Really a dynamic lecturer. He's a science story teller.
I'll be honest, the ID was just based on growth habit on a norway maple. It's a relatively new disease in the United States. Somewhere, there exists some dichotomous keys. They usually rely on the shape of appendages on the chasmothecia and the number of asci and spores. You'd have to google around.  If you find scenescent leaves infect with mildew you may find the small black stuctures. I did a wet mount with those. Then with the end of a pen or probe, you can press on the cover slip until it cracks. You can usualy hear it crack. As water moves in the asci swell and poke out.  It's fun.
Well, the core started hot from the materials condensing into a planet and rock insulates pretty well but that's only part of it.  Radioactive decay is the rest. This continually releases energy within the earth, keeping it hot. On the upshot, this is also where the helium comes from.  Yes, it can eventually run out and solidfy. This is what happened to Mars. Mars, being a little smaller, has a greater surface area to volume than the Earth and cooled faster.
First: Not a race, you racist.  J/k, Taking a guess based on the hares (the people setting the trail) and that fact that it's March Madness, it is probably a start of a Saturday. However, there is a strong chance of drinking at bars until 2. That happens kind of a lot. Some hashes are all night or even all weekend affairs.
Don't get me wrong, bees are expensive and any responsible grower would not use a practice that seriously and quickly harms the bees. But if a grower is getting hammered by a pest right at time of pollination there are tricks to get around injuring the bees.
Looks like it! Although, now that it's been used it is filled with plastic. That glues it in place. That makes unscrewing it a huge pain. What I've done in tha past was to turn the heat on to melt that plastic, then quickly unscrew it with a small crescent wrench. Be really careful or wear thin gloves. Extruders get crazy hot.  If you can figure out another way to get it off go for it. I'd also like to know.
It sounds like you may have a plugged nozzle. It happens to the best of us. Try soaking the tip in acetone if it was an ABS print. For PLA, try boiling the nozzle in water and reaming the tip with a fine needle.
