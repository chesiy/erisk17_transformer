I have a daughter.  She's now in her 30s, but when she was younger, she wanted to "model".  I got her an agent and a manager.  She did a few photoshoots, and got a couple local tv spots, soon got tired of it and went on with her life.  She's nurse manager at a hospital in Atlanta, GA now.  Let this be a lesson to all of you.  Always hire professionals, never do anything without a signed contract up front, a deposit and a lawyer's blessing.  Work with a legitimate agent and manager.  Communicate with everyone you know about what your plans are.  Leave your cell phone number, itinerary with your manager and check in ever 30 minutes when on a "shoot".  Never travel alone to a shoot.  Always go with a friend, your agent, a parent, a trusted companion.  Always have a backup "plan b" incase it goes wrong.
What's to hunt for if they are already here?  http://humansarefree.com/2015/06/5-alien-species-in-contact-with-earth.html
Voat rhymes with Stoat and smells like Goat   That is all.
Benjamin Fulford talked a lot about this on his blog 5 or 10 years ago.    Just do a Startpage search for "benjamin fulford new world order putin china brics" and you'll see the articles I'm talking about.  This was planned all along.    But what does it matter?  Unless you're the CEO of a major corporation, or a the head of a Union or something, there's not much you can do and it won't affect you all that much.  I'm assuming most of you guys are young, probably in your 20s, maybe 30s, correct?  I'll be 65 in 2 years and then I'll retire and be on my merry way.  I guess if you're under 30, you'll be living in an interesting time.  You'll be seeing some strange things happening in the market.  Me on the other hand, I'll be dead.
My point is that she's a glorious looking woman - look at those cheekbones!  This is an unflattering picture of her.  [This one is better](https://i.imgur.com/e80TKjb.jpg)
Maybe so, but it's been reported on by multiple sites...I suppose they are all hoaxes also:  http://beforeitsnews.com/religion/2015/07/christians-couples-file-for-divorce-en-masse-to-defy-gay-marriage-ruling-2492728.html  http://unitedmediapublishing.com/tag/christians-divorce-defy-gay-marriage-ruling/  http://homosexual-agenda.beforeitsnews.com/contributor/pages/437/080/bio.html  http://standupforthetruth.com/2013/06/christians-react-to-supreme-courts-ruling-favoring-homosexual-marriage/

James Corbett / Corbett Report is top on my list  Techdirt / FastCompany / Ars Technica for inside scoop on tech  Schneier on Security for NSA / Encryption  We Are Change (although they have gotten worse over the last year or so, linking up to InfoLiars too frequently for my taste)  The Intercept  Of the MSM, I read the New York Times headlines, and other related sites, just to get a sense of what's going on.  I skim the new posts off GLP to see if anything grabs my attention (it's mostly junk, but once in a while something interesting appears).  Then just a shitload of other middle-of the road sites that are too peripheral to mention here.  I read between the lines and don't take anything too seriously...I read them to get a general "pulse" of what's happening
a colleague's ex wife lived there after the divorce (for about a year).  She said it's infested with druggies, drunks and old people.  avoid it if you can  If you're looking for affordable, yet not too bad, check out:  1.  Belchertown - yeah it's more pricey now than it was 10 years ago, but just a step down from Amherst.  2.  South Hadley - you can find something foreclosed look on Zillow for the latest.  It's a typical new england town full of rednecks and nimby's, but a nice place to live.  3.  Turner's Falls/Montague - yeah there's drugs up there, also poverty, but it's turning around.  Has a nice artist community and is relatively safe.  4.  Shelburne/Buckland - pretty far from everything, but if you don't care about that it's a great place to live  5.  Leeds/Williamsburg/Goshen - see what you can find for housing.  Sometimes you luck out.  Pricier than Belchertown, but close to Northampton.  Places to stay away from:  1.  Ware/Three Rivers/Palmer/Ludlow   2.  Springfield/West Springfield  3.  Agawam/Westfield  Good luck!
I was one of the first few hundred users of reddit...came here from Fark actually, I can't remember when it was, probably 8 or 9 years ago.  Anyway, I've had 5 accounts banned so far.  I'm actually surprised this one hasn't been banned yet.  It certainly is on some kind of a list, however, because I can't post to certain subreddits, and have to wait 9 minutes to post or comment in others.  So what you do is set up multiple accounts based on what your interests are.  Install a VPN like Tunnelbear and use different browsers, clear your cookies each time.  Or leave.
We all were issued a release from the CDC when the outbreak was first announced.  I don't have a pdf of it as it was printed and handed out as part of a packet of UP documents at the hospital.  Also, in answer to your other question: I'm not in Korea, so no.  But it is on the news here in western Mass, which if you think about it, is pretty incredible.  I mean, we're a tiny fraction of the state...yet we get coverage about the MERS situation in Korea.    ------- if the mods are watching this thread, can you find out why I keep getting an 8 minute block on my comments in /r/korea?  I've been a member for a long time.  It's frustrating.
I'm at the Er.  I can't watch it.  Hence my comment.  Not trying to troll anyone
Don't need to hire a PI to find out where the kid is.  Go to "Plenty of Fish" do a search for anyone in Dalian, China.  Offer them $100 to find these Americans (I guarantee they are well known there).  Book a flight to Dalian (14 hours from JFK), kidnap the kid.  Fly home.
it's an aggragator, no more no less.  You have to be able to read between the lines.  There are very few journalists/researchers I trust.  James Corbett is one of them.  His agenda seems to be fairly open, although I did wonder at the fact that he took a very long time to open up about his personal history/timeline.
I'm not here for numbers.  I'm here to learn something and share a little of what I've learned.  I'm here for a laugh and here for a little fun.  If I can't vote, I'm not going to waste my time on a site.  It's why I stopped going to GLP (I originally went for a laugh, that site is a joke), they started banning any IP that didn't log in.  It became a chore to go there so I stopped.    As I said, I don't give a shit about Karma.  I just like to learn and share.
Incoming coup d'tat in the United States?   Has this been in planning since Obama was elected?  Just recently there has been a huge political push to overthrow the United States government by its own members, and high ranking members of other nations. Obama has "failed" the military industrial complex by recalling troops from the Middle East and by not sending in troops during the "Syria chemical weapons" debacle, and Obama has "failed" Israel by not being more firm with Iran. Saudi Arabia is at risk of being exposed as a direct financial supporter of the 9/11 attacks, and Rand Paul had a speech about how Saudi Arabia is no longer an ally of the United States.  Netanyahu has been working directly with members of the US congress in an effort to overthrow Obama.  http://nypost.com/2015/02/18/bibi-why-im-speaking-to-congress/  "Why am I going to Washington? Because, as prime minister of Israel, its my obligation to do everything in my power to prevent the conclusion of a bad deal that could threaten the survival of the State of Israel. "  This means that Netanyahu doesn't believe Obama is working in the best interest of Israel, so he's working directly with members of congress to ensure that something happens to change that fact.  Rudy Giuliani, who was in on the 9/11 attacks, has directly attacked Obama http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/19/politics/rudy-giuliani-obama-america-love/  Rudy Giuliani: Obama doesn't love America  Giuliani, a lapdog, has been making a big scene about Obama. Conservatives love Giuliani and believe everything he says.   Giuliani states that Obama was influenced by Communists http://nypost.com/2015/02/21/giuliani-obama-influenced-by-communists-since-youth/  Rudy Giuliani doubled down on his claims that President Obama doesnt love America in an interview with The Post Friday  claiming the commander-in-chief has been influenced by communists since his youth.  DHS intelligence report warns of domestic right-wing terror threat  http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/19/politics/terror-threat-homeland-security/  They're carrying out sporadic terror attacks on police, have threatened attacks on government buildings and reject government authority.  The DHS was given unlimited power after the events of 9/11. Saudi Arabia has been linked with al-Qaida and the American public wants the "missing" 28 pages of the 9/11 commission reports to be declassified. Netanyahu has stated that 9/11 was very beneficial to Israel. These entities are trying to overthrow Obama and take control of America. Expect a false flag attack in the coming weeks, if not sooner. Afterwards the DHS will launch their plan to incarcerate any that oppose the coup.
