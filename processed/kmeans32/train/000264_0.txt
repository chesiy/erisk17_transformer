A beer brewery in germany
It's from an zoo in germany that got abandoned like 5 to 10 years ago. It got abandoned, because the tenant had not enough money to pay the rent and the landlord was not willing to lower the rent. The zoo itself was first focused on birds and later it developed to a adventure zoo. The terrain itself is about 17ha (about 170,000m or 1. 829.864 feet)

I know already that IPv6 won't influence my ping. The routing of my IPv4 traffic is different from my IPv4.   My IPv4 traffic is routed through the DS-LITE Gateway of my ISP and not directly.  Because of this I don't have a dedicated IPv4 address myself, I'm sharing my IPv4 address with a lot of other users.   This in turn means that at evening, were more people are using the internet connection, the connection to the DS-LITE Gateway is a little bit jammed, but my IPv6 isnt at all (because it would directly connect to Smite).
