I saved the pic from a blog post a while ago but when I looked for more info this morning the blog had been reorganized or something and I couldn't find any info. I thought it was from the AVG in China Air Force in early WWII

I have never claimed this was my picture. I posted it a second time because I  was hoping to make the fudge this weekend but haven't been able to. I just wish i could have met Kay and hung out in her kitchen for awhile, i bet it was nothing but good food and laughs.
NYC, from the G Train Platform in Brooklyn [OC]
Ricki And The Flash Official Trailer #1 (2015) - Meryl Streep Movie HD - YouTube
Read Amy Schumers Ms. Gala Speech -- Vulture
Found out all this the hard way yesterday. Live in Brooklyn and ran over some debris on the NJ Turnpike coming home from the Microsoft Store in the Paramus Mall which put a hole in the engine. Insurance junked it and now I'm taking public transport everywhere. Decided to visit my relatives in Williamsburg only to discover I have to go through Manhattan and transfer to the J or M. Great. MTA's Trip Finder is not working (first red flag) so the wife and I map it out. Decided to take the Express bus (as we had luggage) into the city and get off at Fulton to catch the J. The express bus decides to take the streets instead of the highway (red flag #2) but finally make it into the city an hour later. Walk to the new Fulton Street Subway stop and many twists and turns and a lot of fucking stairs the J station is roped off, walk back to the A going to West 4th street and transfer there. Get on A going in the wrong direction (with help from a visably frustrated MTA worker whose job it was to help people find their way with all this construction, red flag #3) and end up back in Brooklyn so get off and decide to catch the G train. After waiting 45 minutes, now with a platform full of people we all squeeze into the train as the conductor announces this is not the only G train as there will be another one coming RIGHT behind in about 25 to 30 minutes, everyone laughs and no one gets off. Finally we head out to our guessed at stop, Flushing (having never taken the G before, red flag #4) and finally have to walk along some deserted blocks to get to my father in laws apt only 4 hours after we left and we live in the same boro! It's between $25 and $30 bucks each way by cab, car service, Uber, or Lyft and in calculating it would be as much to lease a new car for a year than go through all this bullshit week in and week out.

Chili Chocolate Chip Cookies, for all you Sriracha fans. Link to recipe in comments
I checked http://karmadecay.com/results/u4917517 and I say faked because the books are obviously picked for their color and height and you can't even get to some which are behind he pictures. I doubt very much if they will ever be read.
I picked up Writing Places by William Zinsser because it looked interesting on a thrift store visit a few weeks ago and just got to it. It was a good read and I looked into finding his On Writing Well which seems to be very popular so I was going to order a Kindle edition for $8.50 but thought i would wait a bit for no particular reason. I went to my thrift store again even though I was there yesterday and lo and behold his book was on a shelf! It was NOT there the day before. SWEET! It's not an updated edition but still very readable.

The costs of Brisket, the basis of Pastrami and a popular BBQ/Smoker item, is getting so high some restaurants/deli's are considering removing it from their menu's.

Artisan Bread at The Javits Food Show in NYC last week
I like to post stuff that I like to subs that I like hoping other redditers will enjoy them as much as I do. I like /r/HistoryPorn and it's take on reposting, as long as it at least 3 months or more and it's not in it's top 100 it's ok. Nobody came to my defense when a redditer reposted my post with the same title, pic and to the same subreddit only 3 hours after my original post. In the end who cares?
Yea, it's worth it. Go early the first day, the grab bag will have free coffee and tea products as well as coupons. There will be a lot of fresh teas sold by the ounce as well as tastings. You will also find tea accessories, cups, thermos and other stuff as well. We lasted a long time on all the free tea bags we got from the last years, we just finished a few weeks ago. Give it a shot, the wife and I have fun.
It was just a smart funny quick read. It's her story about dating in LA, her closeted gay "boyfriends", her ex who she lived together with for five years and who wrote a book calling her my fatassed girlfriend and sharing their stories without warning her and her version of their time together. It was just a funny honest look at herself and her love life and her struggle with the death of her beloved cat Emmit and having gone through a similar event with my wife's cat Noodles I could relate. I read it in a day and was just so enamored of it that when I finished it I tried the email address she had in the book to thank her for the nice few hours she had just given me and for her work on one of my favorite TV shows "My Name is Earl" and she answered back the next day! Here's a link to a story about her ex's books http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/23/fashion/chad-kultgens-uncensored-voice-takes-a-more-serious-tone.html?pagewanted=all and here is her page I found after reading the book http://hilarywinston.com/home/ All in all a very nice thrift store find indeed. Interested in a trade?

A Well Organized Staircase, perfect for a tiny house
I'm seriously thinking of either a school bus conversion or a tiny house, that's why when ever I see something like this I stop to check it out. Most tiny houses use a lot of marine equipment intended for boats that are along these lines. i e propane fueled. I think having a really good smoke and carbon detector would be essential to anybody thinking about building a tiny house. Here's a vid of a guy using denatured alcohol https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuFUjoa8ws4
Yes I see that now. I found the pic as I posted it. I also karmadecayed it and nothing showed up so I posted it. I just checked again http://karmadecay.com/results/u4531291. As a general rule I usually use /r/HistoryPorn and their 3 month rule on reposting for any subreddit anywhere. Thanks for not being rude.

Trust me, the first thing to go in a place like this is the quality of the food and the ingredients to make it. They buy cheap and hold for as long as they can which is why I can't stand having a big menu in a small place because once people think the food is sub par while they might buy a coffee or tea they will get anything else somewhere else.
Nothing pissed me off more than somebody parking in my DRIVEWAY! I have the only house with a garage on the block, it's 5 feet from the street and they have to pass by 8 fake driveways to reach mine. Just ticketed a guy parked there all day yesterday! print a copy of your apts rules for parking spots and what would happen if she parked there again and just slip it under the door of the apt she's visiting or if you don't know it under her wiper on her windshield. If she parks there again after you've been nice then ticket or tow her. I've had tickets given but have not towed anybody yet and in NY once a ticket is issued the tow fee is on them.
