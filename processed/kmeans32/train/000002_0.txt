And that's just the way the Kochs and their ilk like it.

Do you actually believe that crap, or are you just repeating what they've trained you to think on Fox News/AM radio?
It's one of the few right-wing rage/wedge issues that still has any effect.  Mark my words: the Republicans will gleefully shove the "pro life" voters under the bus the *instant*  they realize that this wedge issue they've exploited for 40 years is costing them votes.  If anyone out there is still foolish enough to believe that the Republicans are about "honoring a Culture of Life," don't say you weren't warned when the Party dumps you and all of "God's Littlest Angels" like a used condom.
An uncomfortable truth for Confederate apologists, and their modern-day descendants and defenders:  ***The Plantation Owners cared far less about the lives of the poor white sharecroppers than they did their African slaves.*** That's why they sent the poor whites to die on the battlefield. That's got to be a bitter pill to swallow, and the entire "Southern Identity" movement is centered on a collective refusal to acknowledge that simple truth.  "PRIDE!" and "HONOR!" and "HERITAGE!" had nothing whatsoever to do with it. Initiating and waging a war against the United States was an economic decision to make the South's fat and happy Plantation Owners fatter and happier, and they used the bodies and blood and limbs of the South's poor whites to do it.  The Confederate Leadership/Plantation Owners sent hundreds of thousands of poor white sharecroppers into a meat grinder because their sole goal was to keep their cotton profits rolling in, and that required safe, healthy slaves to harvest it. And poor, landless whites had no choice but to go war to defend the slaves who generated the cotton profits which kept the Plantation Owners and Confederate funders going.  So why do so many of the descendants of these poor white victims continue to lionize the engineers of their own families' death and destruction? In a way, weren't these poor white sharecroppers used by the rich white Plantation Owners/Profiteers used as pawns and slaves themselves?  There is one difference: the newly-Americanized slaves never worshipped their Confederate oppressors as heroes and role models. Poor whites who still defend the "Lost Cause" and believe the lie of "the War of Northern Aggression" have spent 150 years venerating the very Plantation Owners who sent their great-great-grandpappies to die to preserve and expand their personal profit.  These aren't ideas that Confederate apologists like to entertain, as if they think about it too hard they are forced to realize that they, like the slaves, were ***utterly used,*** and, very ***unlike*** the descendants of slaves, still continue to the lick the boots of those who sent their ancestors to die (even now, 150 years later.)  If so many poor American whites weren't fixated on maintaining this toxic "At least I'm bettr'n *you*" attitude toward poor Americans of other races, all could realize that, if united, have far more interests in common than they would ever expect.  American conservative leadership can *never* allow this realization to take place, or their uneasy coalition of the past 40+ years collapses from beneath them.  And the power of the "Southern Strategy" (employed so successfully by the American Right ever since Richard Nixon) is fading.

There are many who have a special interest in seeing that stories like these aren't widely distributed.  This is why *Salon*, *Talking Points Memo*, and even *Mother Jones* (for a time) were for so long effectively banned under the fallacious and Mod-imposed "Rehosted Content" rule.   The de facto ban on *Salon* and *Talking Points Memo* was recently lifted, demonstrating that some Mods are receptive to reason. However, *Media Matters* (and others) still suffer under this artificial, Mod-imposed ban.  I believe that Reddit's /r/politics community should reflect *the community*, not the whims of Mods who seek to censor content which they may personally find distasteful. Reddit is meant to be a Free Marketplace of Ideas, based on user-submitted, user-curated content.   Do others agree?
It's surprising that this incident hasn't received more attention.   Why would Rand Paul, who evidently imagines himself a qualified candidate to lead the Executive Branch, consort with Cliven Bundy, who is proud to announce to everyone he meets that he "doesn't recognize the federal government as even existing"?  Rand Paul is clearly reaching deep into his father Ron Paul's well-worn bag of grifting tricks and "LIBERTY!"^TM dog-whistles. Those gimmicks still seem to work on the crowd of oddballs who have fallen for Ron Paul's innumerable scams and paranoid conspiracy theories for decades.
It's a play to the the Republican's key demographic: poor, angry, rubes who fantasize daily "if this country wuz only run right, ***I'd*** be a Big Shot."  The worship of  and reverence for incalculable personal wealth (to which many on the American Right cling) blinds them to their own low status and decreasing possibilities. (Witness the kind of voters that fall for people like Trump, Perot, the Kochs, etc.)  Almost inevitably, their support boils down to the old "well, he's rich, so he must be doin' sumptin' right" canard.
That sounds closer to a call to overthrow the government than violating the Constitution.  Right-Wing Nut-Jobs/Militias are making a lot of noise lately. Worse still, they've become VERY agitated at all developments in the news this past week  the shunning of the Confederate flag, the Obamacare ruling, the marriage rights ruling...  When these people get pissed, they go big. Anyone who doubts the rage and insanity that powers this crowd of [*The Turner Diaries*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Turner_Diaries) fantasists need only remember that after the Oklahoma City  Timothy McVeigh was apprehended wearing a "Sic Semper Tyrannus!" shirt.  Domestic terrorists have short fuses and long memories.
Their father was a founding member of the John Birch Society.
And then the very same scamsters rushed back in and bought those same properties for pennies on the dollar.  Uncontrolled capitalism is far more dangerous than any monarchy. That's the great irony of the United States: having been founded as an independent nation in opposition to the very concept of Monarchy, we now live on our knees before our new Monarchs: the Titans of Capital.
See above.
In other news, Ben Carson won a straw poll.
We all know this has nothing to do with "safety."  Oral surgery has a greater complication rate than surgical abortion. Yet somehow these restrictions weren't placed on oral surgeons (or ***ANY*** other outpatient facilities that perform such minor surgeries.) Only women's health clinics were targeted. There's no requirement for double-wide swinging doors to accommodate hospital gurneys in oral surgery facilities, for example, nor will there ever be.  This is direct, blatant, selective, and persecutive legislation by the Texas government against women's medical facilities and obstetricians performing federally legal procedures.  How many cases of cervical/uterine/breast cancer will now go undetected because of these regressive laws? How many women will die from ectopic pregnancies because they didn't have access to basic women's health care? How quickly will cases of sexually transmitted diseases expand and multiply because no testing or treatment was available? How many women will lose their only access to affordable birth control?  This entire "But... but... *it's for the womens' safety!*" bit has never been anything but a damnable lie.
It's simple: the forced-birthers clearly don't give a damn about either mother or child after launch. Can anyone realistically argue otherwise, given their constant, consistent contempt for any/all programs to assist these post-fetal Americans?  Nope. Almost instantaneously, the women and their newborns become "welfare queens" and "welfare brats" (who don't even deserve enough in SNAP assistance to keep them alive.)  The fetus fetishists certainly don't give a shit about "honoring a Culture of Life" after launch, do they? Hiding hatred of women behind a cloak of "morality" is the exquisitely cruel SOP of the American Right.

The report details that Josh went from sister to sister, stating, Apparently all of the girls were sleeping in a common room at this time.  Imagine those poor Duggar girls lying there awake while they pretended to be asleep, waiting their "turn," powerless to stop their brother Josh from molesting their sisters right in front of the others, wondering what age he'd start on the next one, knowing that they were going to be the next one forced to lift their wrinkled nightshirt so Josh could poke and probe and prod and squeeze wherever he pleased with his sweaty, trembling fingers     and all the time knowing that ***it must all be hidden***, first, to protect the family, second because they were allowed no contact with those outside the sect, and third because no one would ever believe them anyway, instead calling them temptresses and liars and sluts and whores who had brought utter disgrace to the family and destroyed the family's means of support with their foul lies . . .
*Amazing* article here on the Bundy Ranch/Las Vegas "Don't Tread On Me!" killers.

No, it was a deliberate word choice on the part of the poster.  He's a right-wing troll who sometimes instead tries to imitate what he thinks "those damn lib'ruls" sound like.
It's because he's so "pro-life."
I don't think libertarians are that gullible  Are you serious? They fell hard for neo-Conferderate goldbug Ron Paul.

An Important Question for Ron Paul Supporters, Past and Recent   When did you first realize that Ron Paul was not in fact "a Champion of the Constitution" but nothing more than a Neo-Confederate grifter who exploits the paranoid fears of White Supremacists?  Did you fall for the "Hey, he's 'Grandpa Peace 'n Pot!'" rebranding that started online in the mid-2000s to cover up Ron Paul's past and his decades-long associations with the *Turner Diaries* crowd?  How long did it take you to get out of the Cult of Paul? Are people you know still in?  Please share your personal stories.

PaulTards Continue to Throw Away their Money: Ron Paul Raised $1.78M in May
Ron Paul: Strange, Strange People Type Up Every Word I Say!   I mean, their devotion is admirable. It's like my own private C-SPAN!  I will admit, though, that a moment or two to myself would be nice once in a while. Perfect example: after a meet-and-greet with the Jaycees this morning, I was followed into the Denny's restroom by a group of men in T-shirts, stained jeans, and mounds and mounds of facial hair. They kept talking about how Linus (the blanket kid from Peanuts?) could help us line up an account with the FedEx, something something involving gold, something about Fiats also (crappy Italan cars?) They were nice enough, maybe a little awkward socially, but seemed to be decent young fellows and dedicated to the cause of liberty. I finally sent them on their way by autographing ten or so toilet seat covers.  Well, back to it. Who knew so many of my fans were proficient in Gregg shorthand?  P.S.: left tip in doubloons.
Where can I run a Lexis-Nexis search and not pay through the nose?   I don't have access to academic libraries, and it wouldn't be worth it to set up a private account for one search.  Any ideas?  Thanks.
