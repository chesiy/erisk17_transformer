Really? Evidence please. And even though the .1% crazies are 'Republicans', the general populous that is anti-semetic, is liberal. Please. It's like liberals can't possibly admit that they have widespread hatred within their own group. It's just soooo unfathomable!  How bout Jimmy Carter, a former president. Antisemitic asshole. http://allenbwest.com/2014/08/jimmy-carter-leads-democrat-charge-anti-semitism/  Wait for the next Israeli conflict and watch the liberals and democrats spew their hatred.
I like how someone downvotes you without offering any information...  So interestingly enough I got it to work by flippling the '/' to '\'. Just for fun though, I tried the same through Cygwn and GIT Bash and it only seemed to work when I was using Cmder. Not sure I understand that.
I believe so
I identify as a turtle.
This is on top of many other expenditures, including the red line improvement, which was $1 billion. It adds up. It's the mentality - every $50 million we spend - "Oh, it's just a little bit". That's how you go bankrupt. That's how people end up with thousands in credit card debt they cannot pay. You spend a little here, a little there, and all of a sudden you owe $10,000 that you cannot pay back.   Of course, pensions are killer. Not taking away from that.
First the FO website is garbage, now Wimbledon.   Huge upset the other day with Gasquet beating Wawrinka, but I can barely find anything about it. Granted this was two days ago, I should be able to find something easy. Scrolled down and clicked on a link only to find the score sheet. All this redesign of the websites just for the sake of trying to be trendy is all at the expensive of good user experience. /r/webdev it's your fault.
This. It's the worst. You tell a story and some ass goes, "Oh yeah? I can do you one better!". Like seriously dude, I didn't know we were at the 7th annual pissing contest. I'm just trying to chat you douche.
Killing the pride of Vegeta would be kind of ruining a character.  I'm not saying kill it. I'm saying tone it down. Even for his level of pride, it's a bit over the top. It's like, "in case you didn't understand Vegeta's character, here is another example..." over and over again
America is getting worse. Anti religious sentiment is growing daily. One day they will prosecute us, in the name of 'morality'.   Think they will stay silent about our 'barbaric tradition' of circumcision? Think they will let use keep our shuls tax-free? Think non-Jews will be happy to let us keep taking time off for Jewish holidays? Science and evolution? Homosexuals? Judaism is the antithesis of where this country is headed. It won't happen suddenly, but over time you will see.
Thanks Obama
Thanks, got it.
People who overshare, and only the share the best parts of their lives. Not only that, but they always make it look like they are the shit. It's like their entire Facebook page exists to make them look like a douche. Good job, you did it.
That's not a word.  That's like saying "I'd'like" is normal. It's not, but "I'd like" is. No such conjugation "J'm'apelle" exists in the French language. It's simply incorrect, and I'm quite sure you have no idea wtf you're talking about.
Bernie Sanders stood for LGBT Equality long before it was acceptable.  This shows his sincerity, whereas Clinton only came out as pro-gay when the polls were in her favor to do so.
Nope
/u/way_fairer because I want to see how the hell he/she gets all that karma.
This.
Could a business even have profits of they had to pay for all of this stuff on their own?  Who knows? That means roads are paid for by businesses - but that also means Walmart wouldn't pay billions in taxes. Likely, they would still make plenty of money - but the cost might be passed to the consumer.   Even if that's not correct (and it's really really hypothetical), regular government benefits that Walmart and every other business gets, **is not called a subsidy, and defining it as such is intellectually dishonest**.
There is a moment...
A little late to the game, but here it goes...  **I once was sent to the principals office in 1st grade because I was "Innapropriately using the hand dryer" in the bathroom.**  And no, it's not what you are thinking. The teacher pulled me aside after I got out of the bathroom and started yelling at me. I think maybe I was slapping the front of the dryer. Honestly I was confused the whole time. While she was yelling at me she said, "YOU HEAR THAT?" - pointing back at that bathroom - "That's what you were doing!!".   I honestly had no idea what she was talking about. And if that was the case, why didn't she go and pull the student who just came out of the bathroom.  My Mom got a phone call about it. She had no idea what to even think. We laugh about it to this day.
I think the biggest thing is not just the lack of winners, but the lack of depth to Nadal's forehand. You see anytime Nadal hit the ball slightly short, Djokavic would move and play the net (very well I might add). I think if Nadal fixes that up, and gets his confidence back, he can easily win next year.
Some thoughts about Interstellar (spoilers of course)   Just some observations/questions  I have about the movie (and no, I won't ask how it's possible that the future humans can... )  1. **The music might be the best part of the movie**. I mean really, it's phenominal. I've been listening to it at work. I highly suggest listening to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBfk37Fa3H0) from beginning to end. It will make you appreciate the movie even more.  2. **Doyle killed himself**. He could have easily ran into the ranger after Case went to get Dr. Brand. It's really his own damn fault for dying. He waited too long, and then took an extra glance at the wave before dying.  3. **What happened to the spaghetti effect?** So I've read that larger black holes might not have this effect - *but if it is a supermassive black hole, then they wouldn't have been able to 'slingshot' around it - that would have taken years*. Maybe I'm missing something. Either the spaghetti effect should have happened, or they should not have been able to slingshot around the black hole  4. **Murph's reaction to seeing her father**. I get that she was a peace, and old, and didn't need closure anymore. However, I would think she would ask the questions, "Hey Dad, how did you send a message across space and time? And how did you figure out the gravity problem? And where have you been? Why aren't you with Dr. Brand?"  5. **Dr. Brand's poem - Rage against the dying of the light**. I found it interesting that both Dr. Brand (sr.) and Dr. Mann seemed to really liked this poem. The poem seemed to be about fighting against 'the dying of the light' - or the extermination of the humans. Ironically, they are the two characters in the movie that actually *gave up* on plan A - saving the humans. Instead, they *give up*, and opt for just continuing the race - but not saving the people. It seems that *they both did not 'rage against the dying of the light', despite their love for that poem*.  6. **The very cliche "man sacrifices himself to save woman in space"** - I can think of two other times I've seen this in movies. In Red Planet, one character opens his helmet, so his wife doesn't die trying to save him (Tim Robbins). In Gravity, George Clooney cuts the cord in order to save the woman (Sandra Bullock). And here, Cooper detaches to save Dr. Brand. Cliche? Sexist a bit? Doesn't bother me much, just thought about it.  7. **If this movie was released earlier, it probably would have been named 'Gravity'**. Well I'm not sure, but it's a possibility.
Haha yea. And I am annoyed with the "chill the fuck out" comments. I wasn't freaking out about this. I actually have an example of an even bigger parking etiquette fail, 2x Cara behind this pickup.  Oh, and the pickup is still there
So, if I understand the habits of you people correctly  Excuse me?  It's interesting how the Post dissects one of the dozens of times Gruber said about masking the cost of Obamacare in order to get it passed. This article from the post would make sense - if that was the only quote we have a Gruber. And let us not forget our President himself who promised we could keep our doctors, which he knew to be a flat-out lie.  If this was a little bill, it probably wouldn't matter. But this was the biggest piece of legislature in the past 2-3 decades (maybe more), so you can't just throw your hands up in the air and say, "Oh haha that's how they do it in politics!".   I'd like to see Republicans say that when defending Bush's invasion of Iraq, and see how liberals take it. "haha yea we lied about WMDs. You know, people are stupid. If we told them the truth, we would have never been able to invade Iraq! HAHAHA"  Yea, I'm sure you'd think that's totally legit.  And my initial comment was a joke. But it's also poking at liberals who are quoting an Republican Senator in a Liberal state who is now claiming the court cases are built on lies - that's a story here. But building the entire premise of Obamacare on lies? That's not a story. That's my point. They are connected in a way. And it's kind of worthless to be quoting a Republican is who likely just trying to appeal to her Democratic constituents in her state.
What I'm saying is that the rate of transactions today is not good for the end users of these mechanisms, but it is grand for the middlemen who get to claim their piece every time money moves around  Really? You can go read study after study on how HFT and derivative trading greatly reduces volatility in the market - because it is those traders that absorb the volatility.    Reducing the pace of capital transactions is not at all the same thing as contracting the economy, and it may be an excellent way to grow the economy.  Honestly I'm just going to stop here because you skipped ECON 101
Root causes/problems:   * rising tuition costs - not actually the cost of education, but the rising dollar amount that institutions charge to students. This is the biggest problem. We wouldn't care about student debt if tuition was $2,500 a year.  * Increased number of diplomas given out, diminishes the value of the diplomas * Poor economy and job placement after college. * Too many students getting majors that cost too much, and have no hope of paying back the loans. * Not enough students going to trade schools or other fields that do not require a 4 year degree. * Governments continuing to allow public schools to raise tuition  * Institutions using students' money, and taxpayer money to make lavish campuses - but not to better the actual education. * Institutions using students' money, and taxpayer money to increase their reputation by hiring elite researchers (at no benefit to undergraduates) * The *culture* pushed by k-12 that everyone should go to college- if they don't, they are somehow a failure.  The problem is the *cost*, and the *job placement* after college. I think we would all be OK with $30,000 of debt, if we all had jobs that paid $75,000 out of college.  The fact that students are struggling with debt is the symptom of a lot of other issues (that I mentioned). Bernie's solution does nothing but eliminate debt - which is nice - but doesn't fix the root problems - and in fact would likely exacerbate many of them.
Just for comparison, an Olympic size swimming pool is 660,000 gallons. So this oil spill is about 1/6th of that.   Not saying it's OK. Just stating facts. It's still bad when so close to the shoreline. If this spill was in the middle of the ocean, it would have little effect.

We will be lucky if self driving cars can be purchased and used in more than 1 city 5 years from now
Also, why do we need to chose between 'downplaying' and 'alarming'? Why can't we just be realistic and say, "Ok, you're right. If we do nothing, we won't see anything bad happen for 25 years (instead of 5). But we can't wait 24 years to fix things. We need to start now". If that was the attitude, I think people would respond better. But I think we also need to be honest and say that the changes that happen don't have to be overwhelming.   Take for example how we forced US car manufacturers to increase their average MPG in their cars. It has had a strong effect on the demand for gas, and of course the consumption of it. Steps like these should be made. Small, yet significant changes. Republicans would be more willing to listen and actually take some sort of action if Democrats weren't so alarmist doomsday-like.
this was held up in court and created a psuedo R  Thanks for the info. Seems like the bill is too open. "I'm not going to serve you a burger cause your hair isn't covered" is a possibility. Although I think there is a bit of an overreaction as if there is going to be rampant baseless discrimination. Business aren't going to just start refusing all gay people service just because. It would yield too much of a backlash. Maybe I'm just not pessimistic enough
Unless I am missing something, 'JUMP' is completely useless.   Tmobile will pay **up to** 1/2 of your phone when you upgrade. However, this is only after you have paid 1/2 of your phone.  Basically they are saying, "We will buy your phone off of you for 50% its original price, 1 year after you bought it".  The truth is, you can simply resell your phone for the same amount, if not more. All JUMP is providing you an easy way to sell your phone. That's all. Sounds pretty worthless to me, especially since my phone might be worth even more than they are giving me.
