Wait.........
They encourage me to have my boyfriend and certain friends over they don't mind at all! I've been house sitting for them for about 3 years now. I just feel as if he doesn't like me personally. I don't know. I want to sage the house but I would have to ask them before I did
GLORIOUS!
Forgot something crucial for work. Came home during my lunch break to get it and my fiance and this girl were tangled in my sheets. I simply got what I needed and walked out of the house. He ran after me asking why I wasn't fighting for him. I asked him "Why would I fight for someone who isn't faithful?" And that was it. Moved back in with my parents the next day.   P.S- He got her pregnant. She had a baby boy, and put the child up for adoption. She said having a kid would be a burden at 19.
Bummer! Sorry I hope I never have to repeat a day like this again.

What really kills my self esteem is when I'm having a great night at work, no tables have complained and everything is prompt. (Fine dining) And then all of a sudden a cook calls you a cunt in front of all the staff because HE fucked up the timing on the ticket. Broke me down. My tables heard and everything. Real self esteem killer.
Very interesting, thank you!
Something Corporate
I can see the eye. It blends right in like it belongs in the darkness. When I noticed it I felt a huge weight in my chest.    I cannot say I am a professional psychic/medium but I do know I have abilities and many "professionals" have shared that same information with me.   Try saging the house. All corners, door ways, every room including the attic. This can be done at any time, if you are more comfortable with the daylight do it then. Say something to bless the house and be rid of the spirits. Send them on their way to the actual afterlife. Another thing that I do whenever staying somewhere new, hotel, house, whatever- salt. Salt gets rid of negative energy. Windowsills, door ways and EVERY CORNER.

I work at a 4.5 star restaurant. We feature tons of amazing craft beers and wine on tap. This is one of our featured beers of the month.

Ohio is like that sometimes....
My inner thighs get these all the time. Being female and working in a bar I'm constantly walking/power walking and it's mostly heat rash. My doctor told me to always leave them be and just continue to use my Proactive on them cause "it can't hurt". But this one was different it felt hard so I had to squeeze! Really glad I did.
YAAAAASSSSS!
What if you got really drunk one night and ended up going home with him. Drunk like you have long passed blacked out...you wake up in the morning at the not tattooed side of the face is laying on the pillow next to you. He then rolls over..... OUT! DONE!   Idk why that was the first thing that came to mind when I saw this post.

Damn Catholics.
As a graphic design artist you can clearly tell this is photoshopped. Better luck next time!
I've always used a bobby pin or an extractor. It helps to have someone help you with the ones in your ears. SOMEONE WITH A STEADY HAND. You DO NOT want someone to slip and rupture anything inside your ear.   Happy popping!
Let's find these girls and slap them, too many people I know have does from Molly. She is not your friend.
That's okay then it will be all juicy and fun! I canny wait to see, thanks for sharing.
Congrats handsome! We all deserve happiness- even if it only lasts a moment.
