Staaahp I'm blushing. The photographer is actually my friend named Daniel! Every photo I post is basically his! And hey man. We all started somewhere. I started with a beat up 1995 v6, and I loved it. It just takes a little time and you'll get the Mustang you want! I'm not even close to where I want to be, I'll probably slowly trade this up to Mach then a Terminator. And man, DSG, it really is one of the best New Edge colors, on any model! Again, thanks man. I means a lot!
NewEdge booty, best booty
I can't put it on until HOPEFULLY this weekend. So I thought, might as well do dumb shit with it. So yes, I hit make a sexy pose with it. I made my brother take the photo, please help me. And of course I'll post a sound clip. I'm so excited!
I love the 15's, Headroom up front is awesome, being 6'0, sitting in the back is kind of a bitch to put it lightly. The new Mustangs definitely turn more heads than any other car in its class. Personally, I haven't driven it yet so I don't know how it handles, but my friend said it handles amazingly. And seeing him do a slide in a cul-de-sac, I believe him. Berge Ford in Mesa had a few GT's, if you actually wanted to drive one. They also have a 50 Years Limited Edition, but its a 50k car.
Yes.
I was lucky to find it, someone backed out on buying it, so I went for it. Thank you! I'll treat it nicely. ;)
Found a DSG 04 GT in my area, but I'm short 10 grand. Lmao. But you're welcome man, kinda wanna black one out now.
I don't know man, SVT Cobras get a lot of attention and they're in the 22k range.
498
You all downvoted me, but I was right. Since I heard it on the news..
I've been looking at them for so long, just drooling over them. SVTPerformance has so many great termis, that it hurts to log on to it :(
Idk, I've seen some really stupid football players. No offense to your son, or your family name. And I'm not doubting you, I'm just saying! Hopefully he is mature enough to handle that beautiful beast, and tell him I said congrats on getting a ride to college! It's a lot more than I could have done, haha!
C'mon pls.
What game was it? :o
ohmygosh, you have natural selection 2 :o I'd be cool if you gifted it to me, but if not thats fine too. :) Thanks for the give away, I'm sure you'll bring smiles!  Steam name: test_subject7776 sorry I was like 13 when I made the name.
[here](http://www.americanmuscle.com/46-supercharged-emblem-black.html),  Thats if you just want to replace it completely, which might be the best option.  Also a comment that might be important to you (found in the comments on the item): After reading about the chrome and paint coming off, I decided to spray a couple layers of clear coat on them. Made them shine a little more and no peel over time. Over 12 months installed. Maybe 6 on the road and out of the garage.  P.S. : Nice GT man.
I hope! And awesome, that's good to know just in case! Thanks man!
Yeah, I had no idea it was a big deal until he said that I can't join and that no one will take me for a year. I had to go online and read about it today, which was a surprise. I feel like I can ween off my mood stabilizers/anti-depressants, and I'm scheduling an appointment to see if I can. I was getting ready to hit the gym to so I can pass the physical tests too. Well, Now I have a year to get in better shape (not saying I'm in bad shape, I just don't think I can pass the test) Its one year, school gets out in 6 months, summer is 2 months, so really all I'm missing out on is 4 months. Sure I won't get to go with my friends, but I'll get to go someday.
I'm smiling. Wow. Thats just the cutest thing. :D
I'm so jealous. I might hate you, but love you. Sweet Mach and Term mate. How much was all that?
Can I be a fairy too?
Its... Beautiful..
Oh no, I didn't make that long post. I was just making an observation. :P
That's disgusting!
Eh, at least I tried, right? That's all anyone could of asked for!
Happy birthday.  I had my birthday on the 12th, I wish I wasn't here as well. I had gotten out of my second time in a mental/behavioral center for suicide. I even attempted on my birthday in 2012, I just don't care for life. It's boring, and they're making me do out patient shit, which is just large group therapy.  Happy birthday though. Good luck with your life.
Not today with this comment.
Oh.
Hope you find someone.
I feel like people don't understand it's an alpha. I understand that's no excuse, but come on. It's been out for maybe a week and you're all already bitching.
Ah, okay! Thank you very much mate :D!
