The oceans are warming faster than climate models predicted. Going back to 1970, we find that the upper 700-meter water layer temperature has increased approximately 0.3C (approximately 0.55F).
I'm confused as to why you think comments determine activity for subs beyond /r/askreddit and other specifically-discussion-based subs.   9/10 of all posts get zero comments. That was my point when I directed you to /all/new. Most posts die in the new queue, it's a fact of reddit, and part of the upvote-merit system. Judging subs by that is simply ignorant of how reddit works.   And the nerve you hit is the one concerning false claims with absolutely zero evidence.
Um, maybe try reading the story and following the link [to the peer reviewed study](http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150714/ncomms8537/full/ncomms8537.html) it's reporting on.
Dealing with climate change and its risks will require not only technical responses like drought-resilient crops and higher sea walls but also reshaping economic and political incentives that are driving global warming, scientists said on Wednesday.
World Suffering Surge in Extreme Rainfall Due to Climate Change. One out of 10 record-breaking rainfall events observed globally in the past 30 years can only be explained if the long-term warming is taken into account. For the last year studied, 2010, it is even one event out of four.
Climate denial linked to conspiratorial thinking in new study. Examined the comments on climate science-denying blogs and found strong evidence of widespread conspiratorial thinking. The study looks at the comments made in response to a previous paper linking science denial and conspiracy theories.
I love sloths more than anyone I've ever met, but that's weird. You're weird. Get help. Mod's orders.
Renewables to Beat Fossil Fuels With $3.7 Trillion Solar Boom. Renewable energy will draw almost two-thirds of the spending on new power plants over the next 25 years, dwarfing spending on fossil fuels, as plunging costs make solar the first choice for consumers and the poorest nations.
I dunno, let's ask him!  Hey /u/GovSchwarzenegger, who's buying what you're selling?   What's that you say? Just all the states that are going to want a sensible and proven way to to comply with the EPA's Clean Power Plan?!   And maybe some Canadian Provinces? And other countries too as they look for ways to live up to emissions reductions pledges as part of the UNFCC negotiations?   Yeah, that's what I would've said too, Mr. Governator.
"business as usual scenario" would not, it assumes a continuing reliance on fossil fuels.   But some of them would, yes. They tend to do a range of emission scenarios, from no clean energy to mostly clean energy, to mostly clean energy and some carbon capture and sequestration, to all clean energy and carbon capture and sequestration.

Lol nice (though probably doesn't need to be said twice!)
Australian solar company Pollinate Energy brings light to slums of India. "What we've found is by providing a light, kids are going to school, mums are working in the evening," she said. "They see opportunity and they have taken the next step to move upwards and onwards."
Animals don't really rape (ducks one of the few exceptions)  [Let's not forget those bastard dolphins.](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/772/033/3f7.gif)
Letting Shell drill in Arctic could lead to catastrophic oil spill, experts warn. The chances of one or more oil spills occurring as a result of drilling in the Arctic over the next 77 years are 75%.
The point is that the science is telling us we need to leave 2/3rds of known fossil fuel reserves in the ground.   How, then, does it make sense to build NEW fossil fuel infrastructure?   It's like your doctor telling you to go on a diet, and instead you sign up for a rewards card at Cinnabon.   And I don't think anyone (well informed) thinks stopping KXL will have a major effect on the industry. But it's like the divestment campaign, it's meant to revoke their social license to operate.
