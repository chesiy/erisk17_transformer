I'll also recommend Bookstore Movers. They won Washington City Paper's best movers in the DC area 5 years in a row, and when I used them a year and a half ago, the concierge at my building took me aside to say that he had never seen a moving crew work that quickly and carefully. Nice people, easy process, I was thrilled with how my move went.
Not sure why I've been downvoted. When I say it's unacceptable that there is still zero cell phone coverage in most tunnels, that's not based on a first-world problem sense of entitlement, that's based on the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008, a federal statute that originally required coverage in the Metro system by 2012. When that deadline went flying by, it was moved to Sept. 30, 2015. And as the linked article notes, it appears likely that this deadline will be missed too.  I don't expect perfect cell service, and since it's Metro we're talking about, I don't even expect cell service. But we're supposed to have cell service.
Not anymore. Gotta telework.
Indeed. For all the complaints from anti-Israel people that Israel is an "apartheid state", Israel allows freedom of worship, including Islam. Whereas attempts at sharing sites that are holy to both Jews and Muslims is all too often met with violence from Palestinians. Hell, Ariel Sharon setting foot on the Temple Mount was claimed to be the reason for the 2nd intifada.  For that matter, Egypt just banned a Jewish festival at the tomb of Rabbi Yaakov Abuhatzeira in the Beheira province. http://www.latimes.com/world/africa/la-fg-egypt-jewish-shrine-20150118-story.html
You may want to consider contacting an employment law lawyer in your jurisdiction. You may have options under Federal, state, or local law, and even if you don't want to sue, you should at least know your rights. See http://www.goulddcemploymentlaw.com/Lawyers-Dos-and-donts.shtml for info on that process. (I have no affiliation with that website or firm, I make no warranties about the accuracy of all of their points, but it may provide food for thought.)
It's not the grand jury's role to consider defenses, and its not the prosecutor's role or obligation to present facts harmful to the prosecution.   In U.S. v. Williams, 504 U.S. 36 (1992), Justice Scalia's majority opinion stated, "According to the description of an early American court, three years before the Fifth Amendment was ratified, it is the grand jury's function not "to enquire . . . upon what foundation [the charge may be] denied," or otherwise to try the suspect's defenses, but only to examine "upon what foundation [the charge] is made" by the prosecutor... As a consequence, neither in this country nor in England has the suspect under investigation by the grand jury ever been thought to have a right to testify, or to have exculpatory evidence presented..."

This won't prepare you for culinary school, but if you're looking for an easy, educational cookbook with recipes that are intended to be made there and now (as opposed to a multiday process), I recommend Elaine Cook's "Now You're Cooking: Everything a Beginner Needs to Know to Start Cooking Today." It's out of print, but you can get a used copy off Amazon for a penny plus the $3.99 to ship it. It's well laid out, teaches techniques, and doesn't call for fancy equipment.
The picture is NOT of the Palestinian allegedly hurling a firebomb. Read the caption.
Pretty much this... Until recently (I think behavior is somewhat changing due to Uber), even when my friends or I called and asked for a cab with a credit card reader, 75% of the times we'd be told that it was out of order, and do we need him (always a him...) to stop at an ATM.  When out and about with a friend who is blind, I'd see her try to hail and cab and nobody would stop. I'd try and get a cab in 30 seconds or less.  And 20% of the time when I was trying to get from downtown to Bethesda, I'd be told to get out of the cab or cab drivers would try to convince me to pay a flat rate that would be $10 higher than what the meter would be.  Uber is popular because cabs suck, and the DC Taxicab Commission has historically allowed cabs to suck. I'm not shocked that 84 of 308 potential customers were refused cab ridesI'm shocked that the DC Taxi Commission conducted such a study and I'm shocked that they released such a study.
Assuming I live in Virginia and on my way home from work, I purchase a good in MarylandI'd be paying Maryland sales tax. Being a resident of Virginia, I'm not represented at all in Maryland. Do you believe it is wrong for me to be taxed by a government I have absolutely no ability to persuade how much sales tax it decides to charge?  The internet versus brick and mortar doesn't make the answer any different. And the Constitution doesn't enter into either of our scenariosthere's not a single line in the text or any case law that would support the argument you made about constitutionality.
Maurice LaMarche was Chief Quimby on Inspector Gadget (but does an amazing Don Adams/Inspector Gadget impression-it was on the Super Mario Bros. Show), George Wilson in the animated Dennis the Menace (and did the voice of Ruff the dog too), the voice of Egon on The Real Ghostbusters, Destro on G.I. Joe, Zoltan on the animated Attack of the Killer Tomatoes, he's the voice of Dizzy Devil, he did several voices for Captain Planet including Duke Nukem and Verminous Skumm, he took over Yosemite Sam from Mel Blanc, he's done Pepe Le Pew, he was Pasha on Jonny Quest, he's Foghorn Leghorn, he was the voice of the garbageman on the animated Dilbert, he was Mortimer Mouse on House of Mouse, he was Dr. Freeze in the Batman: Arkham City game, Dr. Doom on the Ultimate Spider Man, Kif Kroker and Morbo on Futurama, and a little-known character from Animaniacs named the Brain.
An excellent question, and for Colorado, I don't know. As a theoretical matter (removing it from the sphere of jurisdictional-specific case law), I could see a potential case against both. The facility for failing to notify its employees and the police for failing to ensure participants were aware this might occur. (The odds of an unknowing person being affected by this drill seem higheven if the home warned its nurses, what about delivery people? Patients' families? Other visitors? This points to possible recklessness on the part of the police.)
Respectfully, if you are claiming that DSHEA was passed at the behest of the pharmaceutical industry or that it unfairly limits/restricts/confines dietary supplements, you're mistaken. DSHEA was passed at the behest of the dietary supplement industry itself. It was the biggest legislative victory they could have hoped for-a massive giveaway to the industry.  Dietary supplements are exempt from the premarket approval safety and efficacy requirements of drugs, they are exempt from the premarket approval safety requirements of food, and they can make health claims that foods are not allowed to make.  Dietary supplements are not confined to a status. Food and drug law is entirely reliant upon classification as to what they are, classifications that are largely based on manufacturers' claims. Change the claim, change ingredients as needed, and you can become a drug or food.  After some bad publicity about the ingredients of supplements, some energy drink manufacturers voluntarily chose to reclassify their products from dietary supplement to food. This merely requires ensuring that the ingredients meet the safety requirements of food (generally recognized as safe, etc.) and changes the sort of claims the manufacturers can make about the product.  Note that supplement manufacturers don't want drug status. The whole point of operating in the dietary supplement space is to circumvent the requirements of demonstrating safety, efficacy, and going through the process of becoming an approved drug. If the maker of supplement X were to want to make a drug claim (as in X cures Y), they'd have to file a New Drug Application with the FDA, do clinical trials, there'll be a back and forth with the FDA on efficacy and safety, etc. The supplement sphere avoids all this.
The Archstone building is REALLY close to the metro. And the Pentagon City Mall is right above the metro stop, so, that's right there too (not just Macy's, Nordstroms, Apple, and all the usual mall stores, but don't forget the convenience of the food court, which includes a Panera, McDonalds, Chipotle, Subway, etc.). You'd be right across the street from Costco, CVS, CPK, Chevy's, etc., a block away is Rite Aid, World Market, Noodles   Co, a thai place, a sports bar, an Irish pub,  and one block beyond that is Harris Teeter (grocery store) and Bed, Bath, and Beyond. You'd also be in walking distance of the Aurora Hills branch of the Arlington library, which is small, but they are quick to get in books from the rest of the Arlington library system if you put in a request.  I'm not sure what iidesune is talking about-it's an easy commute with no need to switch to the Red Line. You'd take the Blue Line from Pentagon City to Farragut West. It's five stops, and would take you around 19 minutes.  Do you have any specific questions about Pentagon City I could help with?
I'll look into that too! :) Thanks.
Prices for used game at my local UsedGameChainstore seem astronomically high   I'm just a casual gamer, so, I only buy a few Xbox 360 games a year. I mostly get them from Amazon.com. I recently moved to an area where there's a used game store (a national chain) within walking distance, and thought I'd check out the used price of Grand Theft Auto: V. It's around $55 for a used copy. The store is selling it new for $60. I know full well that across the street, Best Buy is selling it new for $40.  I mentioned to the clerk that they're selling it used for $55 when it's being sold new for $40 across the street, and he just shrugged and seemed uninterested. He certainly didn't make me a better offer.  Looking around, I didn't see any bargain used games. From what I saw, they were all only about $5 less than the new games they sell.  Is this standard for the used game market nowadays? Are these stores traps for the unwary, or is it just my local store?
Democrats are refusing to compromise because they aren't being offered anything. The government operating isn't a Democratic win-it's the way things are supposed to work. It's non-partisan.  Similarly, raising the debt ceiling is also not a Democratic win. It's also non--partisan and the way things are supposed to work.  Republicans are trying to attach all sorts of elements of the Republican platform to these two items. (And note that the continuing resolution to fund the government is only for 6 weeks of funding. It is absurd to suggest Democrats should allow major changes to Obamacare or any other Republican goodie on a bill that allows for only 6 weeks of funding, even if you think that merely funding the government is somehow a Democratic win!)
Good grief. I suspect he's the type most likely to fail. Burnout and all that.  No matter what bar prep course you take, how many old exams you look at, or how many hours you spend, odds are high you'll come across a question you didn't study for. Maybe they haven't tested secured transactions in 11 years and it's your lucky day, they decided to bring it back. Maybe it's a hybrid question that's confusing you. Whatever it is, you still need to be able to look at it, think like a lawyer, and even if you have to make up the law, write a cogent, lawyerly analysis. Partial credit goes a long way. If you're fried from going into hermitage to study exclusively, you're not going to be in any condition to analyze anything new.  The bar exam is hard, but it's not THAT hard. And it's pass/fail. Every point you get above passing is a point you should have spent in the sun.
Well, I'm glad you posted it. I hadn't seen this one before.
Goss seems more relevant than morse. One is entitled to due process before suspension or expulsion, but the due process required is quite minimal.  The granddaddy of student rights cases was Tinker v. Des Moines, standing for the principal that student rights don't end at the schoolhouse gate and that wearing black arm bands in protest of the Vietnam War was protected symbolic speech so long as it does not result in a substantial/material disruption of the school environment.  Since others have brought up the free speech cases, I'll quickly run through the holdings, but I don't think believe they relate to the OP's question. Bethel excluded sexually explicit speech from protection in the schoolhouse context (one could phrase it as the Court deciding sexually explicit speech is inherently disruptive), Hazelwood was about speech in the context of school-controlled forums such as a school newspaper, school events, other publications, etc., and Morse was the court carving a special exception out to allow schools to engage in limited viewpoint discrimination when it comes to speech seen as promoting illicit drug use.  The better cases are Goss, TLO v. NJ, etc.
Iranians accuse Jews of witchcraft
"Getting to Yes" by Roger Fisher and William Ury is one of the classics... I'd start there.  For a more anecdotal book, with less of an overarching method, I like Herb Cohen's "You Can Negotiate Anything: The World's Best Negotiator Tells You How To Get What You Want."
Thanks! :-)
You proposed a faulty hypothetical for a law and actions that already exist, and I'm splitting hairs for pointing out your hypothetical is pretty much already in place?  Senator Feinstein didn't claim that she was qualified to write a law because of her experience with the shooting, she pointed to her 20 years on that Senate Committee and 9 years of experience as a mayor, too.  Yes. There is no exactly analogous ban on obscenity. What this has to do with the price of tea in China, however, escapes me. Getting back to the original argument, that we have plenty of limitations and exceptions to other Constitutional protections like the 1st and 4th Amendments, not specifically enumerating what is and is not obscene is not something that makes it less of a limitation on First Amendment protections. I'd argue that it is a greater limitation because of the chilling effect and, I'd argue (and lose in court, but I'd argue it anyway), that the nebulous definition of obscenity violates the void for vagueness doctrine.
Law is hard. You can't just google symptoms and get a sense of what the range of options is. Every case is different. Your options, how much you can recover, statutes of limitations, etc., all turn on the individual facts of your case, and moreover, it's not just what the facts are, but what facts you can prove and how you can prove them.  There are real reasons why lawyers licensed in jurisdiction A can't practice in jurisdiction B without getting admitted to the bar or being allowed to hire local counsel. The cynical, and partially accurate reason, is a monopolistic attempt by each state bar to protect local attorneys, but the other reason is that every state's laws and rules differ, and even in areas of law with a lot of similarities between states, it's easy to screw things up.  Saving yourself the legal equivalent of a callout and labor can quickly lead to completely screwing yourself and leaving you with no remedy or no defense (depending on which side you're on).
The customer isn't always right, but the customer is sometimes right. Had the exception been printed on the receipt as it was supposed to be, fine, but it wasn't. That's not on the customer. That's on the store. Shifting explanations to vague "health and safety" concerns would likely only make one more suspicious/angry.  You wrote "I'm getting a bit tired of her, and she's clearly just lying at this point", but it would have been perfectly reasonable for the customer to have been getting tired of you and thinking you were lying, given you claimed something could not be returned due to a clear policy on the receipt, that turned out to not be on the receipt.  Not your fault it wasn't on the receipt, not okay for her to yell at you, but even leaving aside your later comments/actions, the customer wasn't wrong to expect a return if the policy wasn't given to her.
Depends. Some allergies can kill people. Others can make people pretty darn sick. (My mother is allergic to dairy products, and sadly, lactaid and other types of meds don't help.)  On the other hand, according to a 2008 article in the British Medical Journal, many "allergies" are actually a manifestation of mass psychogenic illness (AKA epidemic hysteria). http://christakis.med.harvard.edu/pdf/publications/misc/023.pdf If this article is accurate, it makes sense for food allergies to come in waves.
The Wave
Ah! OK, sorry, I missed that!
Adorable! What is your sheltie's name?
Absolutely no reason to use anything extra other than bar prep course materials. The most important thing is to not panic during the exam. Read the question carefully, and respond the way a lawyer would. It is less important to remember case names or even case law than it is to respond in a clear, logical fashion.  Beyond that, I'll pass along the sage advise one of the barbri lecturers told us: every point you get above passing is wasted effort. You don't need to get 100%. You're not looking for an A. You're looking to pass. Don't lock yourself in a law library exclusively for three months. See friends. Read fiction. Go to the movies or the theater. Hell, go to a strip club. Just make sure you are balancing your time so you don't burnout studying.  Study the prep materials, practice the multiple choice questions, get a good night sleep the night before the exam, and don't panic during the exam, and you should do fine.
