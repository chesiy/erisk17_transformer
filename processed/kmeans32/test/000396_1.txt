Crying for you ;-;
I came. o_o
Thanks! That's too bad :(
Aww gosh thank you so much! I used metallic temporary tattoos I found on Amazon and sealed it with base coat nail polish.  3
I was tempted to make a throwaway, since the institution I work for is dealing with a potentially hairy NAGPRA claim right now but I have to say that yes I do. I don't know if NAGPRA is the law you are referring to (and I don't have much knowledge of legislation in other countries) but I do support reburial. I also support scientific study of remains. I know from personal experiences that compromises can be made that allow for study and documentation prior to repatriation.  Also, I can't think of a single example where remains in a historic context were not reinterred as soon as practical. Historic cemeteries are always moved if the archaeology is done right. I don't see why this same attitude does not get applied to prehistoric remains that lack a cultural association. They're still people!
That's awesome! :D Thanks!
And I miss out on Raichu because I refuse to evolve my Pikachu lol. That's pretty cute. :)
Finally taking the plunge on a 3DS and a new Pokemon game   I'm leaning towards the new 3DS since it has better everything compared to the other models you can get new, although the colors don't excite me. :/  I think I am gonna go for Pokemon Y to start with although I eventually want Alpha Sapphire too.  Are there any bundles I should look for? Is it better to get the cartridge or download the game digitally? [I would cry if my pokes became corrupted]  Also, how easy is it for me to send mons from Diamond or HG or Black?  Thanks y'all!
Aww congrats! :)
I would play this. It would probably be the straw that finally made me break down and buy a 3DS.
It sounds like your family could use some happy news. It sounds tough, but happy things like weddings usually lift everyone up. *hugs OP*
An excellent point!
Natural flavorings can still be ambiguous. There's a natural flavoring in one of their raspberry herbals that doesn't agree with me that in no way comes from a raspberry. That said, Adagio is my preferred tea retailer!

Thank you.
You can get a hell of an Obi-Wan saber at Ultrasaber. My boyfriend gave me one for Valentine's day. :) [Me and my saber!](http://i.imgur.com/dS2F7LF.jpg)  You can make it any color because it comes with a programmable LED.
In my experience, I have observed that we get a lot of questions about what it is like to be an archaeologist. Which tells me that like most scientists, we are not so great at communicating what it is we do exactly with the general public.  As a general rule, archaeology is not sexy and I have never seen it portrayed accurately in a film for this reason. For something closer to accurate, think "Scrubs" except with shovels. Most archaeologists work project to project, usually on something related to infrastructure. These projects are conducted in advance of construction projects making use of federal funds. Very rarely does anyone go looking for something in particular (because of confirmation bias for one thing) because archaeology is EXPENSIVE when you do it right, which includes proper excavation and reporting techniques. There is no quick way to earn respect but shitty excavation practices and bad ethics is a hell of a way to lose it.  I'm fortunate enough to be salaried at a major American university, but that also means I no longer do much digging. My main focus is on public education.   Best of luck with your project!  Also, we as a whole have zero fashion sense. Jeans, a button down and boots with most of the dirt knocked off is professional attire. I love it.
Disney has shown the Boba Fett portion of the Holiday Special at special character dining events at WDW. Stranger things have happened.
HAIL SOUTHERN
I already have an alarm set to remind me to try for lunch reservations for my trip. *fingers crossed*
Coming from a chick here- She's overreacting and does not know how to communicate about what bothers her on an adult level.  Sure it hurts you now and don't let anyone tell you it shouldn't because that's an important part of the healing process. But you will be much happier being with someone who respects you more than that.
I really appreciate your in-depth reply. I would be more upset missing TS than RnRC, not sure how my SO feels though. It sounds like I should stick with Toy Story! :) Thanks!
Trying to nail down my HS Day Schedule/FP+   Hello friends. I am trying to determine if I am making a HUGE mistake. I think I have decided to risk NOT FP+ing Toy Story Midway Mania. I know, I know! Let me explain.  We have an 8:25 AM Galactic Dine In Star Wars Breakfast Reservation at the Sci Fi Dine In Restaurant for May 6. The park opens at 9. Since I can either FP+ Toy Story or the Rockin Roller Coaster, I think I am going to chance it and take the Roller Coaster since we are so close to Toy Story in the park. I don't want to rush through the breakfast either though so I guess my question is, how soon after 9 AM does the line become unbearable for Toy Story? I have done it before, and it was WONDERFUL and my SO has never done it (and I know he would love it).   What do you think? Thanks in advance and may the force be with you!
That's a good suggestion. I'll try that when I get home!
Rebels is great for families. Not too scary for kids, enough stuff to be interesting to adults too.
Thanks for the tip. I think that's what we have decided to do. Better safe than sorry!
Awesome!! I didn't know you could try more than one thing. :D   It is a little pricey, but I keep telling myself how many awesome benefits there are to it. :3   How was the food?
LOL I never thought about it that way but you are right. :)

Georgia Southern was barred from postseason FCS games last year because of the transition, but that was a team wide application.   This page has some good info for individual athletes.  http://www.athleticscholarships.net/college-transfer-4-4.htm
Yeah, the stupid rule thing is my main argument. We have met (and exceeded) all the FBS qualifications. We wouldn't have made the transfer if we didn't. I'm bummed out that we are the only conference champs whose season is (probably) already over. I'm bummed out for the senior players who stuck it through the transition, beat Florida in the Swamp, earned an undefeated conference championship, and now have to watch teams they beat go play on the national stage instead. Give me a ONE MORE TIME!!  :)
Yes. Yes it is.
