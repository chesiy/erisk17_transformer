False advertising. At least that's my complaint. If he wasn't such a huge part of the trailer, it wouldn't bug me in the slightest. But it was advertised like he was the star and it is very clear why they did that. For example, it didn't bug me in the slightest that Ben Affleck was killed off immediately in Smokin Aces. Everyone knew he was in it, but it wasn't marketed like he was the star. Huge difference.
Hahaha my bad, was writing on the go. But you get the gist.
Honestly, I'm humbled by the efforts in this post and really, really wish I could make a contribution. I'm usually that guy who ruins the on-going joke, so best leave it to people like you and u/MarkyMark8 to do the honors. Thank you guys :)
I'm sure everyone will appreciate it! Thanks!
I'll be waiting at Duke's.
Anyone want to take a stab at Reddit writes Frasier?   I love what Reddit does for Seinfeld, and with the amount of love this sub gets, I have to think that one of you could put together a scene. I don't possess that unique talent, but does anyone here want to give it a try? Maybe to help get these started, I'll use a prompt I used in one of the comment below  **After accidentally ruining the ending of a new movie on his radio show, Frasier faces major backlash from Seattle and Roz who really wanted to see it. Meanwhile Niles believes he is getting a dog allergy to Eddie** Maybe something like that?
These are all good points, but I feel like my point may be lost in interpretation. I'm saying he never actually killed anyone that we're aware of.
It is insane though because they will be all in with still half their stack. It isn't as if they're down to 4 BBs. They will still have a lot of chips to play with but shove every.single.time.
I seem to always get downvoted when saying ANYTHING remotely critical of this movie, but there just isn't anything special or unique about it. I agree, it's a great movie and there's nothing fundamentally I would change about it, but I feel like people (younger people in particular) see this as their Stand By Me. It is a very good movie, but really isn't something we haven't seen before. Go ahead. Downvote me.
Alan Rickman doing his "Bill Clay" in Die Hard still throws me off. I literally have NO IDEA where the difference in his accent is supposed to be. "Ahhhh! Ahh!! You're one of them!" I'm like...we know its you, Hans.
Trace Buster Buster!
Shut your bucket.
Yeah, and wow that was such a perfect song for that scene. You just can't hear it nowadays without getting psyched up.
This isn't exclusive to this sub, but I see it a lot on here: When someone comments with just "this"
I don't exactly agree, but this is the kind of answer I was looking for. Actors who could play each other's roles convincingly enough. Thanks.
What I hoped for this post: something other than the obvious.
