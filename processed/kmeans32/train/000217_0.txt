this is awesome.  I've been working towards something like it off and on for a while this but it never quite feels right.
underrated movie.
Still my favorite valentine
fair question.
sweeeeeeeeeet!
I know that feel, bro.  http://i.imgur.com/Yym82B5.jpg
worst beer in the world. just awful.
I was changing the blade on a hockey stick once and reached out and caught a glob of hot glue as it was falling to the floor... Sticky. Painful. Stupid.
Joseph Campbell's spin on that, "The fool says in his heart there is no God' (Psalms 14:1). There is, however, another type of fool, more dangerous and sure of himself, who says in his heart and proclaims to all the world, 'There is no God but mine.'" - Joseph Campbell, The Masks of God, Vol. IV: Creative Mythology, p. 28
yes
The blue crew basically executes promotions for the marketing department.  Things may have changed but at the time we were under the same direction of the guy who signed off on the music, graphics, etc.     Most nights were routine. You come in, talk about the promotions running that night; who was going to escort Charles Glen (or whoever, I believe it was still alternating) to the ice, who was going to round up mighty mites and their parents and get them through security, etc. We would pick the participants for contests from people on the concourse early so if my friends were going to the game I made sure they knew to be there early and to hang around the section where we came out on to the concourse so they could get one ice for whatever we were doing that night. Officially it was frowned upon but it was understood that if you had friends at the game they could participate in the promotion.  Once I got to wear plain clothes and walk around with a radio and pick the winners for contests on fan appreciation night.  Totally arbitrary; if I dug your shirt, you were the guy.  Probably my favorite story though was one night after the slingshot bowling thing on the ice.  We would get reminded all the time that we HAD to be off the ice before the intermission clock got to a certain time or the Blues would get fined by the NHL.  I think it was 10 minutes but Im not sure.   So we do the sling shot bowling and it goes like it normally does and its time to go.  I unlatch the big bungee cord from the penalty box side of the ice and start to gather it up. At I start to head for the Zamboni pit the guy out there with me starts yelling at me.   I run over and the bench door is closed on the cord and the thing is wedged shut.  We got a guy from the ice crew  over to help us out and the thing just isnt budging.  The clock is ticking down and there is still a huge bungee cord laying all over the ice. So with seconds left I run out and start gathering up the cord and start throwing it onto the bench and dove over the boards as time expired.  We couldnt just hang out on the bench so we ended up cutting the cord and leaving via the locker room which was kind of cool.    Little things:    A lot of European players play soccer in the halls to warm up,   Saw Panger doing a national Hockey night broadcast for ESPN once and he would stand on a box when doing the pregame with Steve Levy.  Just a tiny man.  You all know that Christ Pronger was a beast but Im 61 and generally am thought of as a big guy.  Standing next to Pronger made me feel like less of a man. On skates the guy was just a monster.  I know a guy who managed to turn multiple years on the blue crew into a front office career in the NHL.  The actual Blues offices where the GM and everyone works are right there at Scott trade.  Its the door to the right of the parking garage entrance.  (it just never occurred to me.)

[troubleshooting] new build wont boot with GPU   I just finished my first build. Without the GPU the system boots fine and runs normally but once the GPU is attached the screen just stays blank. Fans spin and lights come on but nothing else. 1 long beep then 3 short. Some googling pointed me towards the possibility bad video card. any other ideas? Any assistance would be appreciated.

Man, The Stag logo is like sending up a Belleville flare.  I was in China a few years ago. I took a day trip and was bullshitting with the other people in the group.  I mentioned I was from Belleville and the first thing they said  was oh,  where they used to brew Stag? Fucking surreal.  Literally as far away from home as I can possibly be and the first thing people think of when I say Belleville is Stag.

Wore JNCOs... I feel shame
Claims of divine revelation or divine inspiration dont necessitate the expectation of scientific accuracy. It sounds like you are referring to biblical literalism or biblical inerrancy which are a completely different.    Look, You don't have to argue like Pat Robertson is across the table from you.  Im not even Christian. I dont think the bible is divine anything, I think its an entirely human product. It tells us what our spiritual ancestors thought not what god thinks.   At the risk of being overly broad and simplistic, it breaks down like this. There are two basic understandings of contemporary Christianity. Call them liberal and conservative for lack of better vocabulary. Both are the result of Christianitys collision with the enlightenment.   One is a defensive rejection of enlightenment knowledge (conservative), the other is a discerning integration of enlightenment knowledge(liberal). But its important to realize that both understandings are recent. Phrases like literally true or biblical inerrancy arent first uttered until the second half of 1600s and didnt become common until the 1800s.    The idea that its dishonest for beliefs held by the community, literal or otherwise, to change based on new information is just ridiculous. To what other belief system would we apply such a standard? Why would we expect Christianity or its theology to be static? They dont exist in a vacuum, they are dynamic,  they grow and evolve and respond to history. Of course some literally held beliefs have been cast aside. Others have been invented from practically nothing (Trinity anyone?)This is the nature of ideas, the nature of culture and language.  That doesnt invalidate the entire tradition.  Look, I think the fundamentalist need to press their faith into sciences conceptual mold so that they can walk around with some  self deceived certainty about god and the universe diminishes their own tradition and is destructive to society. Yeah, ancient people believed stuff we know to be wrong (if only they had the benefit of your 17 years on the earth -just a guess-) Yeah some people, out of some sense of obligation to what they think they are supposed to believe about the bible or pure good ole fashioned stupidity, still believe some of those same things.    Im not sure everyone gets it, maybe cry about it some more.
I just think King spends so much time in the characters head that it makes it really tough to communicate all the important parts of a story visually. Which is probably why Shawshank is arguably the best King adaptation;  It's not terribly long and there is a narrator.      Apart from that can we just say, "do whatever Frank Darabont does."

yeah, he was in shock
I wouldn't say it's compelling but i always found Anselm's ontological argument interesting.  It's intellectual slight of hand but kind of fun in a way. To me it seems like the Christian version of the Tao Te Ching's "the Tao that can be named is not the eternal Tao"  http://www.princeton.edu/~grosen/puc/phi203/ontological.html
A guy i know went to Sky Zone indoor trampoline park. I guess Its all fun and games until your break your fucking foot off.    His brother sent me this right after.  The connective tissue didn't even break it all just wrapped around to the side.  Edit: Removed extraneous detail for clarity.
