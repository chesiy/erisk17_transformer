The official forums are still the best way to get official support, this subreddit doesn't have to replace anything. It can be a place for discussions. /r/inoreader deserved a fresh start, it's up to the community to take advantage of it :).

Evga Supernova NEX650G buzzing noise   Hello. I have an Evga Supernova NEX650G Gold Power Supply 650W. During the past weeks, the PSU started making a buzzing electric sound. It's not very loud, but you are able to hear it, especially if you are near the PC/PSU.   I checked for loose connections, tried the computer on another socket, with and without a UPS, nothing helped. According to the BIOS, the PSU is giving the correct voltages and there has been no malfunctions. But is this sound normal?  [This is a video](https://vid.me/Sqke) i recorded on which you can hear the buzz )starting at 00:09). You can hear a similar noise [on this video](https://vid.me/qB2) (it's from another user having a similar problem with a similar PSU).
No. I repeat: in my opinion, YSK that Microsoft OneNote for Windows, which was a paid app and part of a costly Office suite, is now available for free, with many updates.
The authorized service found nothing wrong with my phone. From what i read, there are many Lumia 920/930 with screen issues. It's up to the service if it's going to offer a replacement.  EDIT: For example, look at the replies [on this topic](http://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-reportedly-working-fix-lumia-930-display-woes).
New steam user here, i'd like to start my collection with this game :).  http://steamcommunity.com/id/djdbgr/profile
It's not just the preorders...   Companies that focus to the multiplayer side of a game and downgrade single to a "get ready for the multiplayer" experience are also hurting gaming.  And no one seems to make a buzz about it..

I bought a Lumia after my Nexus 5 broke down. Nexus 7 is still going to be around as a tablet, mostly due to its great battery and big screen. But, as a smartphone and for daily usage, Lumia is going to be there :-).
There are many apps that i'm counting on in Android, but i don't think there's anything that i'm not able to find an alternative for in WP right now. I'm not closed mind or a fanboy of any company or OS and Windows Phone is definitively a choice for me.  My price ceiling is definitely around ~200 euros. it's the specs that matters for me right now.
Put your music and your new album on **SPOTIFY**. That's another way to **LEGALLY** listen to it. It's 2014, internet is not an enemy, music must be accessible.  Any plans on that?
This is Loukanikos, the valiant dog who faced down Greek riot police during the height of the eurozone crisis. He died today. RIP
Mmm, maybe i chose the wrong sub. I want to host a favicon for a Tumblr blog.
That's great. Someone is keeping an eye for me.

Hundreds of legitimate IPs are hitting my website like bots   Hello everyone. Starting yesterday, i'm facing a major problem with my website: even though, for the last 3 months, i was having a very small number of visitors (most of them from my country), the number exploded yesterday and now i'm getting several hundreds of hits. This could have been a good thing, if they werent real visitors acting like bots.  So, here is the pattern:  - Hits from every country imaginable, from multiple IPs. If i block their country using Cloudflare, they dont come back (so they are unable to solve a captcha). - Analyzed some of the IPs, they seem legitimate, no spam or bot records, nowhere. - Each and everyone of these IPs has a useragent in the lines of Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.11; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/6.0. Some of them have different versions of MSIE or Trident. But they all have this agent. - Every hit is to my index page. I believe that some of them hit my naked domain, because i see a redirect. They get to my main page, and from there, some of them, hit a few .js, .css or images. But the majority does nothing, stays for 0 seconds and leaves. - Hosting provider cant help, since they believe that all those hits are from legitimate visitors (so, someone wants to convince me that users from Vietnam, Cambodia, Singapore, Senegal, Iraq etc suddenly type the address of my greek blog to their browsers, pay a visit of 0 seconds and the leaves. Nah...). - No refferal, since they are all direct hits.  This is causing me problems, since im on a limited shared hosting account. They also hit my Adsense (no hits, just impressions), so i decided to remove it temporarily (in case Google blocks it for malware activity and fake hits).  The only thing i could associate with this situation is some hits im getting from a bot. They are a distributed computing project, so they might direct all those IPs to my site. I contacted them (waiting for answer) and blocked their bot using robots.txt. No difference.  Some of the hits from my logs:  - 46.130.101.177 - - [05/Jul/2014:12:01:28 +0300] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 301 138 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/4.0)"  - 46.130.101.177 - - [05/Jul/2014:12:01:30 +0300] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 20742 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/4.0)"  - 89.152.206.67 - - [05/Jul/2014:12:01:34 +0300] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 301 138 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.11; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/6.0)"  - 89.152.206.67 - - [05/Jul/2014:12:01:34 +0300] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 20742 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.11; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/6.0)"  - 78.174.87.179 - - [05/Jul/2014:12:09:15 +0300] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 301 138 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.11; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/6.0)"  - 78.174.87.179 - - [05/Jul/2014:12:09:15 +0300] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 20742 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.11; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/6.0)"   You get the pattern. There is a long list that looks like this.  Has anyone else experienced this situation? Is there a solution?  Any help is appreciated. Thanks in advance.
