God enough of the arguing. Being a jew was settled in ww2, it's an ethno-religious group, if you dislike this idea of it being an ethnic background as well  as a religion go take it up with the concentration guards. I'm sure isis,hitler and the various other antisemitic movements give a crap if you identify as an ordinary white person they would have still killed you just like the rabbi or the owner of the kosher butcher shop.
Being born and raised in a african country does not make you african. Like me being born in germany does not make me german. Does not matter she's still a boer, just because the country is called south africa does not make her an african. I'm a american due to my country name, but i'm not a native american even though due to my great grandfather being blackfoot i can legally claim as such. Damn white people always trying to steal our culture, history and ethnic classifications.
Number one, i'm a Zionist and we're not oppressing anybody. How do i know this? because i actually do research. My information is not based on fb post and twitter messages with a picture of a kid blown in two that is later discovered to actually be a syrian. I can go into the fact that 20% of israel is arab, a third of the israeli government is made up of arab israeli political parties, a supreme court justice is arab and the various things that israel does for Palestinian arabs like you know make sure they don't starve to death by providing truck load of food to Gaza, allowing the wife of abbas in for medical treatment or the granddaughter of the pm of hamas but i'm not because you would not even listen.  You don't know any facts about the situation, if i told you west bank and gazan's were obese fat assholes who place in the top ten most obese people in the world you would not believe me, if i told you president abbas of the pa authority has a hundred million net-worth and the leader of hamas is a billionaire who lives in opulence in qatar now turkey you would never believe me. Because you don't think you don't research. I do. I had a Palestinian teacher in highschool who gave me the same crap about oppression and planes versus rocks then guess what? i read a book. I read a book about american history in i learned history is not one sided, i learned about the messed and utter bullshit we did that our history book's omit in i learned to read between the lines in do my own research.  That's how i learned that the palestenians aka arabs suffer because of their own stupidity, that's how i learned why israel is blockading gaza and why the world seems so content to allow the new "nazi's" aka israel do this in guess what it's not because the jews control congress (but it's cute that the entire pal narrative relies on blood libel to convince the always anti-semitic euro's to hate the jews even more) it's because israel is a secular democracy, it's because israel is the only country in a region full of arab nation's that provides more rights to Arabs then even arab countries provide to their own citizens in sometimes this is to the detriment of the jewish israeli's especially when one pal arab who got a free college degree while in prison for stabbing a jewish kid gets out in becomes a bomb maker for hamas or coordinates more "resistance" attacks by targeting kindergartens.   Fun fact look up how many Palestinian leaders (like those who founded bds) studied free of charge in israeli universities, how many got degrees even after being convicted of terror charges and look what they did with it. They immediately go in yell death to israel, when you say palestine what you're referring to is the british mandate that ended in 47-48 with the full recognition by the un of israeli independence and the creation of jordan/israel the results of the former mandate, the arab state of palestine never came to be because the arabs refused.  But you won't read this because you think that a made for tv media propaganda campaign devised by the arab world to help affiliate the destruction of the jewish statehood(theirs a reason why they wave flags declaring all of "palestine" over israel) you're the sap. Btw you're correct isis exist because we invaded, kicked out saddam and disbanded the majority sunni iraqi army, our bad, were sorry next time we should leave a brutal dictatorship in place, that's the messed up part about the region, their so f-ed up their only reasonable leadership is theocracy,dictatorship or terrorist groups.

Damn it i knew you would see the line and misconstrue that, let me reiterate a line can be curved. I am not line biased. No but in all seriousness it's not speculation that is bad or dangerous, it's not even gender or sexuality speculation unless you're catholic in then that may be a problem. Rather or not Lawrence of Arabia was gay,straight,bi or even asexual is a very fond subject of historical biographers, speculation is a big part actually when it comes to biographical portraits of historical figures, the main issue however is when this speculation is passed off as fact.  The thing about biographers is allot of what they write on a person, specifically personality traits and other characteristic's that are not backed by specific writings or other things are all really just speculation when it comes down to it this is the norm. But theirs a difference between presenting something as speculation and presenting something as fact, earlier a poster referenced suicide rates on post op trans and you had at him because obviously this is not factual. The same can be applied to you, i have no problems with speculation but you should clearly label this as speculation of the gender identities in historical figures/people's when citing it for the basis of your statements instead of passing it off as fact. I know this was probably because you're tiredd of transphobes and want to present a strong argument to shut them down but in the long run it might be better so you won't have to deal with anyone attempting to discredit you on the basis of this alone.
No were not claiming anything. We simply stated we could compete if soccer was more popular in america, just like we could compete if cricket became more popular in america. This is not a claim but a well established facts, america does amazing in the Olympics. On a international scale we repeatedly shown we're definitely top ten in most sports.  I could give a fuck all about your football, but stop acting like you idiots have a set recipe for making great football players. England invented the sport in they suck at it, yet i here people making the same bullshit excuses about how america is only good at sports we invent. I have no idea who does guys are, so i have nothing to compare them too. It's not about having 6ft tall beast though, you are stereotyping because you have a onesided view of american athleticism, we have 300+ people we're not all Michael jordans, have you seen american quarter backs? look at brett favre? you call him a example of athleticism, a QB does not have to be a adonis of athleticism to be good or even great at the game some of the best one's were couch potato's. we can find 5ft7 guys just like we found the women for soccer.  But to do that we need coaching staff, we need people to actually care about the sport. Jesus this is why america does not care about world opinion, you assume we're ignorant and not conscientious then are shocked when you're proven wrong. You guys are the most elitist jackasses i have ever seen, all we're stating is that we could compete, just like we always do and we could be good. Because guess what, that's what being an american is, even if we suck we don't give in, we keep practicing and trying harder. We don't believe in defeatism or relegating ourselves to being underdogs. Maybe you guys should stop being assholes in maybe try learning this thing called sportsmanship? oh wait no you guys are just a bunch of ultra nationalist who use football to talk shit about other countries while decrying america as a hive of uberpatriots fuck off.
Tell that to japan about baseball or china about soccer.
Yeah sorry once again that was not clear. The "you" was in reference to Reddit admins and have no morality was in reference  to their policies on censoring in how ironic it was that the ceo of reddit would give coon town a pass because they don't brigade but support the banning of FPH.   I'm really sorry if you misconstrued my post as an attack on you, i did not remotely mean it to be directed at you, it was horribly worded but if you continue to be a disrespectful individual i will be very clear so you will understand when i am directing vitriol at you. I suggest you calm down before you get more upset in this conversation turns from misunderstanding to a extremely negative exchange. Have a nice day.
Starwars republic commando, say what you will about consoles but that was one of the most graphically beautiful games i have ever played. One of the best looking in that generation and funnest game play experience i ever had. Nothing beat taking over a confederate ship and firing upon another with the hacked cannons while fighting off super battle-droids. PLUS I MUST FIND SEV!!!
Not just sample bias i'm aware theirs even a sizable number of kurds fighting for isis. I believe the commander who laid siege to kobani was a kurd, but i'm an american my view is effeminately colored by my own personal experiences and a generally held view by most Zionist and supporters of Israel along with the news stories and other tidbits i hear coming from kurds.   But i'm more then willing to hear more information concerning them. Not going to lie i have a romanticized opinion of the kurds, it's hard not to like the underdog perspective. I read the yousef post, you have allot of links i will try to read more of them later(also no offense but i'm not exactly a fan of al jazeera, while some of their articles are pretty informative the bias kills, granted all media is bias so better to read between the lines other people might reject them just for being al jazeera )  While i disagree with them for arresting the guy heavily he is not being executed. In honestly that's my criteria when it comes to rather or not a country is really embracing of democratic ideals. I know that it's horrid to arrest someone for their religious beliefs or not holding anyway but compared to other examples of those who blasphemy islam i think this is a pretty moderate approach that hopefully will be utterly reverse with more people writing in.   Also to be clear i mean't the kurdish people, not the government or the political parties, the kurds are in a transition phase so their government may not be the best or even ok i believe in the people theirs a higher chance at secularism then other parts of the region.
He's referring to the fact that there are millions of Muslims and not that many Christians. There are millions of people who are more then able who can help the Muslims including you know 1.2 billion Muslims, along with 22 arab states in the immediate vicinity, but it's out of his capability to help them also, the Christians do not have any allies, the western world is not coming to save them. It's like during the holocaust, millions died, are you going to go grab a gun and try to liberate a death camp or help the lil Jewish girl you found wandering in the street. It's called recognizing your limits and focusing them where they will be of the most help.
Weird. Whenever someone finds the need to explain their ridicule and derision with more then one post it's usually because they have a hard-on and a need to be right. You seem to misunderstand simple concepts, i did not describe toxic masculinity because their is no such thing. I stated clearly not everyone fits into the masculine role and not every lil boy should or will grow up into such a role. You believe i am contradicting myself, so let me clear this up, the masculine identity is one you're free to choose or not choose.  Your concept of masculinity like your argument is a throwback, you believe that their is a omnipresent cultural pressure to force a boy into a gender identity and this masculine ideal. You believe the only way to stop this "masculinity" is to emasculate all those who choose willingly to embrace masculinity, maybe not you directly but those with similar opinions. In other-words you're doing a scorch earth policy when in reality all you need is a scalpel.  The only way masculinity as you believe can be toxic is if masculinity becomes a set ideal or benchmark, in while in the past in certain societies you would be correct, their was a definite ideal of what well defined masculinity entail but like time itself things change, what you consider toxic someone else considers the norm and what they consider the norm i find weird. This is where our world view departs, instead of seeking to better understand the different meaning of masculinity and what makes a man masculine you're seeking to rid the world all together due to a prejudice view of a stereotyped concept because you believe this will somehow free young boys and give them the ability to have even more choices when in reality you're essentially limiting the choices of all the boys who would prefer to simply grab the action figure or play cowboys in Indians because you're afraid that this will once again become the standard or norm.  But now i'm rambling. To wrap this up. Masculine like feminine is a diverse concept both heavily stigmatized and stereotyped, we're living in a new age where women are able to redefine what feminine means beyond the idea of a gentle sexual being who is emotional. Which is i know what you would classify as a "toxic" femininity because it's the stereotype, but my point of view is that instead of trying to destroy these "toxic" beliefs or ideals in one fell swoop we should learn from, encourage them so we can truly understand what feminine and masculine is, so we can begin to understand the complexities of these concepts. Now i probably did not explain this perfectly in you will probably reply i'm right at the edge but i fail to to see what lies beyond but you're also failing to see my simple point which is that some people are not willing or do not wish to see the complexity in femininity or masculinity they are stuck on the stereotypical view in which to destroy it all together.
Found the conservative!
Nope consoles also.
I love this, lets ignore the statement and then ask who is saying this, if i have never heard of it, your point is invalid. Seriously you never heard of the yes does not mean yes campaign? seriously i have a friend in the uk, feminist was telling me rape laws were not inclusive and they need to add more definitions like how being coerced into sex(if your partner badgers you but you don't feel like it, his continued persistence even if you're reluctant) should be considered a form of sexual assault, how regret should be considered valid.  In false accusations should be punished extensively, you can't declare rape is a serious crime and then allow the false reporting of rape to continue, you're making a mockery of rape, you're basically saying rape is the worse crime a woman can endure but it's perfectly fine if another woman lies about rape and deliberately hurting how actual rapes will be treated in the future, has no one ever read a boy cried wolf, same concept applies.
Bro you need to read the context of my post before spouting off. You clearly posted a point about kids writing their names on missiles then inferred they would be targeted at kids like them, which is not the case. Those missiles are not being targeted for children but Hamas(in the kids who die are not intentional, not even the most biased news sources state such things, unless you live in switzerland or something more then likely you know what collateral deaths are don't try to act like everything that occurs in war is completely intentional), while i may not agree with the idea of pride in your national military forces or patriotism it's entirely common for kids to be taught as such. Them signing their names is nothing different then us pilots marking jet fighters with naked women or writing slogans on their tanks, yes the inner leftist in me thinks why would you be proud of a weapon of war but we know how morale goes in any conflict. Anyway you generalized both sides hate each other, i was trying to show you by the humanitarian rights orgs(many of which are anti-israel government) such as btselem is that's not the actual case.  If i wanted to be a propagandist instead i would post vids from the idf youtube channel showing them sending food to gaza and the great humanitarian programs israel has, telling you about the stories of hamas pm grand daughter being allowed into israel for medical treatment instead i made a simple point about the conflict not being black and white.   Secondly i never claimed they did not exist. As we understand now the Palestinian Arab people do exist, rather or not this is historically factual matters little. More then 7 million people believe they're Palestinians so they're Palestinians. In the historical context though and the origins of the national identity is what i was referring to. Secondly i never claimed any such thing jesus read my reddits correctly.  "Hamas never called ahead before sending a terrorist (not a fucking freedom fighter) Seriously dude, it depends on perspective who is a terrorist or a freedom fighter. You are only seeing it from your perspective, try to see from other perspectives. permalinksaveparentreportgive goldreply []test_subject2180 1 point 4 hours ago Ok lets look at this from the arab perspective. I'm a lesbian secular christian Palestinian arab, hamas is a radical islamist organization made up of mostly males between 20-60 with their leadership effectively 40-60 year old conservative religious males. Now please explain to me as a lesbian female living under a radical islamist government, how are they fighting for my freedom to be a lesbian and secular let alone my rights as a woman?"   I was making a point about rather or not hamas can be considered freedom fighters and if so who's freedom are they fighting for. To sunni's in iraq the isil caliphate could be considered freedom fighters but to their fellow shia they're barbaric terorrist whereas to some sunni these guys are nothing but pure thugs etc. Please understand context.  No need to insult me friend. BTW if i was a propogandist i would not put "zion" in my name. That kind of gives me away as a mossad israeli puppet who is trying to promote propoganda:)
