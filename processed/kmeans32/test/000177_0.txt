Honestly, I'm exaggerating. Movies is right when it comes to certain genres, but I keep letting the hype train for things like superhero movies and action movies get to me. I clearly don't like the genres, but I keep thinking "this one will be different!" It's my own fault.  I thought Mad Max was going to be some revolutionary movie based on the circlejerk, but it just felt like any other action movie with some awesome cinematography, but nothing else to make me care.
It should kill the bacteria that builds up in my mouth overnight, but will not wash away physical matter - which itself is damaging and will attract more bacteria.  I figure, if there is no food stuff in my mouth (as I would have brushed before bed), it seems like a waste of time brushing when I could just mouthwash. I'd rather brush after lunch for maximum efficiency (as I hear brushing more than twice a day is bad, I'd rather 'use up a brushing session' when there is actual food stuff in my mouth).
Exactly the kind of stuff I was looking for. Would commoners have uttered this phrase or paraphrased it?
I crafted some decent gear and did a lot of sidequests so now I outlevel everything. I still use them for bosses or throw the occasional Tawny Owl out just to speed things up a bit, but most enemies die in a few hits and are easy to dodge regardless of whether I use potions or not. I might get hit once per fight so it's not worth the hassle of opening the menu up and scrolling down to my pots.  I think that's the main problem with this game - there are lots of sidequests, which  is great, but the leveling isn't spread out enough. You just end up outleveling everything by exploring and before you know it you can equip some mean ass sword or armour.
In his vest.
Lex Luthor, Dr. Doom, Bane and Adrian Veidt all appear on Shark Tank. Who can get the best deal?   So I did this a short time ago with [heroes](https://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/3c9t4h/batman_peter_parker_reed_richards_and_tony_stark/) and said I'd consider doing it again with villains (well, antagonists since I included Adrian). So here it is. Some of this will be copy pasted from the other thread, but I made some changes to the rounds:  It's the current US Shark Tank. Each character goes on assuming a secret identity - that of a young entrepreneur in their early 20s. This eliminates the default perception of the character (ie. investors feeling safer investing with Wayne, a billionaire, as opposed to a mere Uni student). However, they keep their current personalities. **Important note: Any item pitched is free from existing patents, etc., so basically ignore issue of ownership for existing items**  * **Round 1)** Each makes a new invention designed to resolve a common household problem. It can be any problem, but must be applicable to a typical home. They have 24 hours to choose a problem and create the solution. Each has $500,000,000 at their disposal for some overnight R D. And what problem do you think each is likely to address?  * **Round 2)** Any invention they have ever made - they MUST have made it personally (eg. Adrian had Manhattan's help). Pick the one you think would have the most success from each character and pit them against eachother.  * **Round 3)** Each must gain funding for a plan to cause mass destruction. Specifically, they must pitch an item, project or service to that Shark Tank crew that can secretly be used for ulterior evil motives. For example, tricking them into funding a new brand of toothpaste that contains mind controlling fluoride. Remember, the investors will be watching the project careful, so you can't simply take the money for one thing and build a nuke with it.  **Remember to take into account marketability**, affordability (even the Shark Tank guys aren't likely to pitch in for a Batmobile), rough manufacturing costs, etc, and the individual personalities of the Shark Tank hosts. I haven't seen much US Shark Tank, but I know in the Australian version you can get an idea of which host is likely to go for which products.  Finally, major problem with the last one: The Shark Tank guys are rarely ready to invest for more than a few hundred thousand. Is getting an Iron Man suit to market at all possible with that amount?
This is retarded. Yes, technically bodies decompose and release their chemicals into the air. However, for it to 'scatter across the cosmos' it would have to leave Earth in the first place, and it won't. And even if it does... so what. It's just a bunch of chemicals. It's no more meaningful than one of his broken nails decomposing to feed a plant.  And he's definitely not watching over us, that's just retarded. He's a fucking corpse in the ground and his neurons stopped firing.
Banned.
I think you missed part of your story. Why were the police there? Where was your dad? Was your mom fucking the other cops or something haha
Dank memes.

I didn't make assumptions. I admit complete ignorance one how is friends perceive him. I offered potential alternatives - not to state that those are true, but   Me: ***Maybe*** they like it (the alternative being that maybe they don't, I have no idea).  You: You **should** reevaluate your definition of personal space. I'm **sure** you've made them uncomfortable and didn't even realize there, Rico.  In my circle, this kind of interaction is pretty normal and is just as often the girls getting close and playful as the guys.  Sometimes I feel like Reddit is full of prudes.
Seriously what century are we living in, your assumption is that he is always the one getting 'handsy' and they are all secretly awkward. Maybe they like it? Maybe they're handsy back? Maybe that's just normal in his circle?
Would this build be viable for Death March?   I started a Signs based build because I didn't realise how easy it was to replenish potions (thought I'd be using them too sparingly to bother putting points in that tree). However, after realising their are restored by alcohol I've been using them a lot and I'm thinking of respecing into an Alchemy build. I don't like bombs, so I'm thinking of doing the following build:  http://www.gosunoob.com/witcher-3/skill-calculator/?combat=115 sign=153 alchemy=115_125_143_225_252_323_345_415 general=321  Some explanation: -Deliberately didn't max some skills -Muscle Memory to 5/5 (just for a bit of extra damage) -Delusion to 3/3 (just for a bit of a boost of stamina + dialogue options) -Not interested in using bombs, I'd rather stick to a signs build if bombs are necessary for an Alchemy build to work -Would place Synergy with a strong red mutagen -Rage management to help keep Quen up -Skipped delayed recovery as potions should already last a long time -Refreshment I'm on the fence about as Swallow already will last a long time with this build -Frenzy just sounds obnoxious to use, so I skipped it -Oils seems good all round, but I'm skipping the last skill because I feel like my adrenaline will be used for the occasional sign due to my playstyle. -My remaining two slots would likely go to a point or two in a sign skill, or maybe some of the yellow skills, but honestly, I don't know if I'm liking to reach this level on a single playthrough due to how slow leveling is.
What's the point of this?
I think this is most likely just to get people who didn't play it the first time round. A little extra cash.
JUST FUCK MY SHIT UP
It's shit
I find this hard to believe, but will happily be proven wrong. My main issue with this is the fact that if it were so cheap, why doesn't a competitor just slash 5k off his car and get all the market share. Eventually other businesses would react and cars would be cheap. Product differentiation only answers part of the story, there would surely be huge markets for cheap high quality cars.  Is it possible whoever told you this failed to factor in marketing, administration, sales %, salaries, R D, etc?  An alternative to OP: it's a promotion expense or they're making money on average by getting people through the door and buying other things with their free item
This is what gets me. She's fine for three movies, then she does a few things in one movie, and people act as though this is the entire character. It's classic tumblr cherrypicking.
No, opinions are fine on ELI5. You're acting as though they are worthless. Opinions, supported by reasoning, precedent and logic can still potentially be valid and are just fine in lieu of facts. The only issue is if it's presented as a fact, which 004forever didn't do, it's clearly an opinion.  Edit: You're fucking retarded.
I don't see why dodging and blocking scores any points...  ...? It doesn't. Go look at the punch stats, Mayweather landed more punches than Manny. You can call the sport boring and Mayweather's style is absolutely awful to watch, but at the end of the day he landed more punches. Were we even watching the same fight?
Well done.
Paraphrasing a reply I made elsewhere in this thread:  "It doesn't really answer my question directly in the first place: are they attempting to get you to remember the ad by appealing to something we like (and failing, but having the end results remain the same anyway), or deliberately making it something communities like Reddit will cringe at and recall.  I'm really more interested in the thought process of the advertiser rather than whether or not the ad is effective. Are they disconnected, or deliberately producing material that communities will cringe at but remember anyway."
What was he supposed to do? Get out and challenge them to fisticuffs one at a time? What if he doesn't stand a chance at winning, or they gang up on him?  OK, so that's a bad idea. Well... drive away? Wait, they're surrounding me, I might bump into them. "Sorry Mr. Drunk Asshole, I'll put the car in park and let you ruin me financially and destroy my livelihood"  How about the third solution. Oh wait there isn't one. I guess we'll let violent people just walk all over us.  What's your solution exactly? I'd like to hear it.
Chalices: What's the difference between a standard chalice, root chalice, central chalice, etc?   I don't know why this sub requires it to be mandatory I supply text here since my thread does not need more than the title in the first place, so here is some text - and now I have to wait 10 minutes to make my post again because of this pointless rule.
How is this game for single player only?   Basically, I've been travelling a lot lately and this is the first day I've had to get on the Internet in two weeks, so I haven't kept up to speed with this game. I am about to go without Internet for awhile again in a few hours and I'm thinking of picking up a single player game to kill some time.  So, tl;dr, how crucial is the co-op to fully 'experiencing' this game? Is it like Borderlands, where I can still enjoy it single player, or is it more like Left 4 Dead where the emphasis is on multiplayer?
[Suggestion] Heroes fart when they die.   A lot of good suggestions are making it to the front page today, so I thought I'd take a moment to suggest something I think Dota has needed for a long time: heroes should fart when they die.   Honestly, I fully expected to have this feature by the time the game got out of beta, but that felt like a lifetime ago now. I think this should be added before TI5 as a priority feature, but they'll need to start ASAP if they're going to get all the VA's in to record farts for their characters in time.
So The Witcher 3 comes with the first 16 DLCs free... what are the odds of paid DLC after those?   Particularly, actual expansions with new quests etc?  I was kind of disappointed to see Dark Souls 2 release three expansions AND a 'remastered' edition within the first year of its release, I regret not just waiting and getting the definitive version. What are the odds of The Witcher 3 taking the same path? Should I pre-order or wait a year or so for a 'complete' version to come out?
How to handle jobseeking while currently employed?   I'll keep things brief. I'm looking for a job relevant to my degree. I have taken a full time job in the mean time. They think I'm going to be here for years, I'm just treating it as a temporary job. I have applied for new jobs since then. Odds are, I'll get a smattering of interviews at random times throughout the coming months (not in one big block), so I can't just keep booking sick days or taking random time off throughout the day and my lunch breaks are only 30 minutes.  I have no leave accrued because I've only been working this job for a few days.  What do I do? I feel really trapped in this poor paying job with bad conditions and no career progressions, but I can't quit (financial reasons) and can't find a way to attend interviews for better jobs.
Now that it's been out for awhile, how are people finding the Steambox and its controller?   Are you still using it? With SteamOS? What are the pros and cons?  The controller is obviously out of date, but how are you enjoying the trackpads?  Edit: I'm referring to the early Steamboxes that have been given out a few months back.
Lucious Fox is Batman   So it's been a pretty big secret to who this Batman character really was with many characters discussing the possibilities throughout the movies. But I think I have gathered enough evidence to show that Lucious Fox was indeed Batman the whole time.  1. Lucious had access to all the technology that Batman had used throughout the series as the head of Wayne Enterprises military contracts division. This can be clearly seen from all the scenes in which he is showing off the technology to the Bruce Wayne character. 2. The movie spends a disproportionately large amount of time focusing on Bruce Wayne and Harvey Dent for some reason. Why? So it seems more natural to have Lucious Fox on screen. 3. Lucious Fox CLEARLY hints at being Batman in the scene where he is confronted by that accountant dude or whatever. 4. Batman dresses in all black. Lucious Fox is black 5. Why the Bat theme? Bruce Wayne has a fear of bats. Lucious spends a large time around Wayne. Wayne most likely relayed his fear of bats to Lucious 6. There is no other likely contender from the movies main characters (Dent would be too busy during the day to go around at night crime fighting, Alfred is too old, Gordan and Batman are seen on screen at the same time, Bruce Wayne is too busy working out, taking tours of the military contract division, hiding from the public eye and playing with bat themed military gadgets to go around crime fighting) 7. I zoned out of the movies a lot to be honest, which means that there was probably LOTS of evidence I overlooked suggestions Lucious is Batman, which is EVIDENCE IN ITSELF.
