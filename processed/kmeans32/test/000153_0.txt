What small annoying insignificant thing causes you to rage inside furiously everyday without fail?
Id like to have seen the map the day the batman v superman trailer released. it was arguably the better trailer but suicide squad still looks awesome the trailer just didn't live up to the BvS comic-con trailer.
Sauce?
if marvel is still casting spider-man this late the that means one of two things....   1. Spider-Man must not have a big role in Civil War and they are filming around his scenes until they cast someone  2.Negotiations with Asa Butterfield are taking longer than expected and marvel and sony are getting nervous so they are looking at alternatives in case negations fail.   just some food for thought.
Anyone heard if the following will be picked up by another network?   So the writers finally found a way to freshen up the show at the end of season 3 but fox had to ruin it and cancel it. Anyone heard if another network might pick it up?
Anyone else feel like Age of Ultron was just a giant setup for things to come rather than be its own movie?   Mean while Civil War will actually be the big kahuna that we're all waiting for and marvel decided that age of ultron along with ant-man were just a bridge to fill the gap while we wait. It was almost like a filler episode of a tv show setting up and teasing whats to come and didn't really move the plot forward aside from meeting some new characters. Maybe this was intentional or I just picked up on it due to Whedons background work on TV? It just felt like an episode of a tv show that plays before the finale you know what I mean?
yea its fair. i liked the first movie and loved guardians and cap 2. I found the first half of ultron a bit boring and tedious to get through.I didn't start appreciating the twins till the second half of the film. It definitely shows that Whedon is running out of ideas and its probably a good thing hes not doing infinity war. id say its fair. Ill be a bit worried if it keeps dropping though.
no.
so whats the current status on home cinema technology   So Is 3d bluray still a thing, and do people use it? if so whats it like? Also whats the current adoption rate of 4k tvs? have you guys moved to 4k yet or are you sticking with 1080p tvs?
Wilson Fisk might be one of the MCUs greatest villains ever   Don't get me wrong the MCU has had some cool villains not great but cool. Loki was fun and entertaining to watch kinda reminds me of the joker a bit. Bucky was awesome too. But Fisk is just on anothr level entirely. Every time he was on screen I was legitmately scared for our heroes whic has never happened in the main MCU films because we know our hero will survive because hes got another movie out the following year. Now I really want Fisk to shows up in the new spider-man movie that would be amazing.
Had to google this cause I never heard that Joss was actually pissed about it but it seems like he actually is from what I read which sucks because I think Idris was just excited and accidentally let it out I don't think he purposefully did it just for attention like some articles make out he did. If he is cut from AOU because of this I'm glad Joss isn't doing Infinity War he seems like a bit of a dick imo but im sure there's more to this than we publicly know.
Furious 7 bluray release date?   Seen the movie a couple of times now and I'm eager for the bluray release. Any ideas when?
Reddit, what makes you a scumbag?
keep it! not sure how you just find a mobo with an i7 on it lol but kudos to you haha.
Whats the most stupid thing you've done in public?
Heres a few pics of my case. The fan you see near the hard drive doesn't work anymore it hasn't been working for a while but I didn't think it was an issue until I saw my hard drive temps. I have no idea how to remove it because the way the case is designed. Hence why I just want to put a fan underneath the hard drive itself. sorry for the quality of the pics btw I used my ps vita lol. http://imgur.com/a/WaQ1m
So just to clarify, the 970 is still a decent card for 1080p?   May have the opportunity to pick one up on Tuesday. A local computer store is having a sale on 970's and its within my budget so I'm thinking of getting one. I play at 1080p so I just wanted to double check that I wont be affected by the 970 memory issues.
What if ghosts are, in reality, glimpses of time travelers?   Think for a moment about ghosts. There are two proposed types: intelligent ghosts, and memories. Then, there are time travelers, something that seems unrelated at first thought.  Intelligent ghosts are the type you can interact with, and can interact with you. Some consider them to be dangerous, and others think them friendly.  Memories, however, are like a recording, repeating over and over. Imagine hearing a childs laugh every night at 3am. It is always the same, and always plays at the same time.  A time traveler dropping into the past for ten seconds would be able to interact for that brief moment. To an observer, the traveler would be seen appearing from nowhere, doing an action, and disappearing. Could this be considered a ghost as well?
This article is from last year. Old news.
I got mine from study link. Here in New Zealand .Its basically a subsidiary set up by the government and offers interest free student loans. You can also get a student allowance which is free but is dependent on how much money your parents make which will impact how much you get per week. Or you can get living costs which you have to pay back on top of your student loan up to $175 a week.
Has anyone got the ASUS ROG G551JM gaming laptop?   So this semester I have to get a laptop. I'm pretty much settled on the Asus ROG G551JM. Just wanted to see what people here thought of asus laptops. Are they of good build? do they last long etc?
same, here's how Id do it. At the end of AOU Banner is shot into space after cap and falcon break him out of a government holding cell set up by stark after banner looses control of the hulk, cap tells banner that its the only way hell remain free but cap tells banner hell call upon him when hes needed again.Eventually his craft crashes into Knowhere, Banner makes his way out of the crashed craft he looks up we see groot smiling at him and he says I am groot, end scene.
This seems to be the "cool" answer to any half life 3 related post these days. But we all know you will still buy it day 1.
The only reason Boyhood might win imo is because of the whole 12 year process behind it and Birdman wont win because its such a mixed bag. You ether like it or dislike it. Mean while Whiplash is more grounded and has great performances all round and its got the technical awards behind it to for best editing and sound which past best picture winners usually have as well.
Well **** you Rockstar   I said to myself that if it was delayed again im gonna  give up on the pc version and get it on console and that's exactly what Im doing. sorry guys but **** this. Im getting it on ps4 next week. that's just how it is. I still have my pc but its time like these where my faith in Gaben tested.
Finally got to see John Wick   What an awesome movie. Beautifully shot. Especially the fight scene at the end reminded me a bit of the neo vs smith fight from the matrix with the rain and lightning in the background. So good.  This movie may have rebooted Keanu Reeves career in the best way possible. Lets hope he takes advantage of this success and we see him in more of these roles.
it comes out in August thats more than a few months away but you are right. we should of had a teaser by now.
yea i was gonna say wtf man, taking your computer and tv sure thats what burglars do but to steal a mans bed? fuck your asking for trouble now son. A man needs his beauty sleep.
yep your all good :)
wtf, i seriously hope your joking. your in some serious shit other wise.
Has anyone noticed that James Gunn has been getting rather vocal lately about the guardians and their connection to avengers and the MCU as a whole?   So in all his interviews recently, I don't know who keeps bringing it up whether its him or his interviewers but he keeps mentioning how he doesn't want people to think of guardians of the galaxy as an infinity war prequel and how he doesn't seem to fond of the guardians crossing over with the avengers and it all makes him sound rather arrogant imo because its not his decision to make where the guardians are placed in the MCU.  Now in all fairness I can understand that he wants guardians to stand on its own but guardians is part of the MCU that's never going to happen and its inevitable they will meet the avengers one way or another with or without Gunn.   It seems to me that perhaps Gunn doesn't like where the MCU is going and Feige's vision as a whole since he even complained recently about writing Thanos in to guardians and how much trouble it was and how it was a plot that was just serving the avengers and didnt really add anything for the guardians and he doesnt want guardians to serve the avengers which again I can understand but its not his decision to make.    Kevin Feige has a master plan hes the quiet puppet master who is pulling the strings behind the scenes and it seems like Gunn isn't too keen on following his vision. Not sure if its just me but that's the vibe im getting he wants guardians to stand on their own just how Edgar Wright wanted Antman to be standalone but that obviously wasn't going to happen and he had to be let go.   It looks like Gunn might be in a similar position and hes starting to get rather vocal about his opinions (Which I think is good) but I hope he sits down and seriously thinks about what hes been saying before he gets in trouble with the higher ups at Marvel and Disney.   We all know Marvel isn't afraid to change directors. I think what it comes down to is can Gunn and Feige come to a neutral agreement on who has the most control because it sounds like Gunn wants more control than he actually has. I'm only speculating here and more than likely Gunn is just messing with us and behind the scenes hes completely on board with the avengers and guardians crossing over (I hope anyway) however If worst comes to worst they may change director again and thats the last thing I want. Thats just my opinion though.
I must say after patch 1.3 the game is now more than playable on pc.   Havent played the game since release on pc so decided to try patch 1.3 and I must say even though there are still some bugs that need to be worked out like still being able to glitch in walls and swimming in mid air lol in terms of frame rate and just in general the ability to just play the game without stuttering its a huge improvement. Just thought id add my two cents.   Specs of my rig.   I7 4790 8GB RAM GTX 660 2gb
