Lots of people here are saying "cash", but I think it is clear that you'd prefer something else.  You're asking about a payment methods that is safe, secure, and can't be faked, while at the same time not exposing you or the buyer to holding large sums of cash.  You want bitcoin.  I know, I know - bare with me.  If the buyer wants your car, they can set up an account at a place like circle.com or coinbase, or a number of others.  They will be able to buy bitcoin with their bank account, transfer the bitcoin to a wallet (on their phone, for example), and then come to meet you.  They can inspect the car, and if you agree to the sell, he will transfer the bitcoin to your wallet (again, on your phone, or computer, or whatever; I recommend the Mycelium Wallet).  The transaction will show up almost instantly, and you'll be able to see the bitcoin leaving his address and going to yours, but there won't be any confirmations.  Wait for six confirmations (about an hour) and you can be almost certain that the money will not be double-spent, and it is yours.  Then, sign over the title to the buyer, and you are done.  If someone were to try to take your phone (to get at the bitcoin), simple passwords and 2FA will keep them from spending it until you recover your wallet.  You can keep your new bitcoin or deposit it into an exchange to turn it back into your local currency, whichever you prefer.  The biggest difficulty would be getting your buyer to buy all that bitcoin.  But, if you're willing to learn how to use it, it will most certainly be the most secure and safe way to transact.  Best of all - you can do it at any hour of the day (no need for an open bank!)
It is certainly true that Tarantino builds and releases the tension in the opening scene in a variety of ways; I am sure that one could write an entire piece on just that idea and find it very fruitful.  There's the claustrophobia that you mention, the movement of the camera and the closeups on two outstanding actors, but that is only the beginning.  The scene seems to breathe with tension as it alternates between interrogation, comic exaggeration (Landa's pipe), and horror.  I would agree with you that this is Tarantino with his full powers realized.  But where I think this scene truly shines is in teaching the audience everything they need to know to understand how the rest of the movie is going to work.  It shows us how spoken language will be important; how comedy, tension, and gore will interact, and introduces us to the titanic character of Landa, who drives the plot as much as anyone.  It truly is a great opening scene.
It is a little rough nailing down exactly what it meant by "critically acclaimed" (not your fault - there's just different metrics from person to person), but you can make a little headway.  If you look at the highest grossing box office returns of all time, there are some standouts.  *Frozen* sits at #5 all-time, and was very well received by the critics, and there are some other very good animated films that have a similar standing (see:  *Toy Story 3* at #14 and *The Lion King* at #21).  The best films in blockbuster trilogies tend to be well-represented, too:  *The Return of the King* is at #9 and won 11 Oscars and both *The Dark Knight* and *The Dark Knight Rises* sit in the top 20.  The best answers that are not animated or comic book / fantasy franchises are things like Inception (#43), *E.T.* (#48), and *Forest Gump* (#76 ).  All of these films made over 2/3 of a billion dollars, but once you go around 500 million you start to see things like *Saving Private Ryan*, *American Sniper*, and a bunch more.
If you want to have some fun (is that the word?), check out her videos on abortion.  Or women voting habits.  Or anything, really.
I said this in jest to my wife last night (we're both UF alums who were there for both of his Gator Championships).  It really isn't *that* crazy of an idea, but I am pretty sure that he wants to build an entire program and have full control with recruiting and what not.  The college game is just so different, and now with the playoff system it is easier for an always-solid team to have a shot at the championship game most years (without a playoff system, the Buckeyes wouldn't have had a chance this year).  I also think he likes shifting the power away from the SEC, and he's doing very well in that regard.
Let's just call it what it is . . .   This was an absolute choke job.  Only CJ Anderson showed up today.  Poor showings from the wide receivers, Peyton Manning, and much of the defense, especially on critical third downs.  Talib may have had his worst game as a Bronco.  Demaryius looked spooked most of the time.  The Colts decided to be physical 1-on-1 with receivers and we had zero answers.  This looked eerily similar to the Superbowl at times, and the Colts D is not the Seahawks D.  Disappointing.  This is now twice in three years that Fox and company have squandered a first round bye by losing to an underdog.  And the other year they were out-coached in the Superbowl and embarrassed.  I'd guess that people will be clamoring for Fox's job - but there aren't really reasonable alternatives in mind.  Staying pat for at least another year would be the best move; 4 division titles in 4 years is still an achievement to be proud of.  Good season, Broncos.  Always looking forward to next year, but this one leaves a nasty taste . . .
I'll look for it in earnest tomorrow.  Also, obviously Tebow was a rollercoaster for everyone involved.  You know we lost 7-3 against the Chiefs **at home** the week before various miracles won us that WC game?  That's just not a healthy way to live . . .
This is slightly false - The 33 yard FG was missed while we were down 4, true.  But, the defense actually forced a stop and punt - which Isiah Burse fumbled.  The resulting short field led to the touchdown and the 11 point lead (assisted by a defensive holding on a 3rd down stop).
I mean, Oreo line is OP.
"DAE Padding stats?  LOL, Peyton/Fox are poor sports!"  Did you watch the game?  How about the vine?  It is still the 3rd quarter here.  Peyton came in *for one play* and then the Lobster had the whole fourth quarter.  It is kind of amazing how far some of you will stretch the events to fit your preconceived narrative.
How about that defense?  I mean, I know Detroit isn't exactly known for lighting up the scoreboard, but you hold a team under 80 and you will win a lot of those games.  And did you hear The Manimal talk about Josh Smith shooting his team out of the game?  Seems like people are listening to Shaw.  I like the bigs, too.  The three-man rotation of Mozgov, Nurkic, and McGee gives us a lot of hard fouls and good rebounding.
I have never seen Jerry Jones and Jason Garret on the same screen together.  Could they be the same person?  Like, a *Looper* type of situation?
Just think about the particular history that you want to highlight.  Full Game Superbowls exist on youtube, just have strong Google-Fu.  "John Elway's Greatest Comebacks" are also on youtube.  You can find the entirety of "The Drive" and "The Drive II".  You can find Louis Wright returning the 2nd of two blocked FGs against the Chargers.  You can find the 1977 AFC Championship against the Raiders ( IT'S ALL OVER, FATMAN!!!).  Just go on a hunt.  It's all good!
I hope it is earlier than old Floyd Little made it in.  We (the Denver Broncos franchise) could draw real attention to the issue by making damn sure that nobody who dresses in blue and orange ever wears #30 again.  I love David Bruton as much as the next savvy special teams fan (Keith Burns, what up!?!?!), but *come the fuck on*.
Totally right.  Football in the new era is getting to the dance,  then playing your best 3-4 games there.  If we play like the SF, SD, or IND games in the playoffs, we have a good chance.   If we play the SEA or NYJ games, not so much.  It is true for every other team in the league, too.  But I think that the Broncos have a greater margin for error than almost every other team, and that feels good (for example, both the D and O can carry us if one falters).  GG.  Fuck the Raiders.
Ugh.  No kidding.
Own.  That. Shit.  It is *your* sandwich,  too.
There seems to be a huge omission in this thread.   People are bringing up stealing soda and maybe signing autographs and being generally stupid ("FUCK HER RIGHT IN THE PUSSY!"), but no one has mentioned that he is very likely a rapist?  Possibly multiple times?  The investigations of which were likely covered up by FSU? It would be very foolish to think that this issues won't resonate with NFL GMs, and it likely causes him to fall in a manner similar to what happened with Aaron Hernandez.  I would be embarrassed if the Broncos drafted him.    Tl; dr - Likely rapist will be drafted, but later than based on talent alone.

Yeah, it'll save us the trouble of competing with the Braves for Wild Card spots and Pennants.
I want all orange ones.  I fear I shall never get them.  Are orange pants too much to ask for in this life?  ARE THEY!?!??!
Is it weird that every time I see MAC my first thought is Arnold Schwartzenegger screaming it to a bald black man who is out of his mind with grief / vengeance?
No contest.  Avatar was straight-up Evil Military Man destroys native home at behest of soulless corporate white collar nobody.  Tired, cliched, stupid, insulting.  The "evil" here is comical, unimaginative, and can teach us nothing.  Ferngully was blue collar normal people just doing their jobs when they are taken for a ride by a force greater than themselves (and kinda mystical).  This is how evil is done in the real world - common folk unwittingly ascribing to evil ideas far greater than they understand.  Ferngully  Avatar.  And that's without even talking about the musical numbers.
Read a book.
And your* a moron.  * sic.
Nah, that's an absurd position to hold.  You don't lose by 35 by "Not showing up".  You probably don't lose by 35 by being outplayed, either.  You lose by 35 by getting outplayed AND by "not showing up".  It is definitely both things together forming a perfect storm of shittiness (or awesomeness, depending on your viewpoint).
Yeah, that is pretty great.
Me too, actually.  I love to hate the Raiders more than the Chiefs and Chargers.  I want our rivals back!
PM me or reply right here, buddy.  I can help you out at least a bit.
1.  The virus is generally thought to stay in the neuron where it is latent, but a smoldering cell to cell infection is also possible in the ganglia  2.  Auto-innoculation is definitely possible and happens often.  3. It is possible, but there is not much known about genital - oral transmission rates.  Suffice to say it is likely nonzero, though.  4.  HSV and VZV belong to the alphaherpesviruses.  I think what you are looking for, though, is "neurotropic".
Such an understanding is exactly what I (and many others) are working on, and I can say with some confidence that we are definitely on the right track.  Some stories I can tell involve signal transduction alerting the neuron, resulting in a remodelling of HSV chromatin into a more active state and then general reactivation followed by the more canonical IE, E, L transcription, but a lot of the research is very new and needs to be further developed before the idea of a complete mechanism is developed.
There are investigators out there who think that most of the time HSV reactivates and tries to undergo a reproductive cycle, the immune system catches it and everything is fine.  But, sometimes, it appears that the virus overcomes this, and is able to productively infect again.  It may be related to more individual reactivation evens (so, 10 neurons pop off instead of just 1 or 2, for example).
Slowing Building a Respectable Bar; Starting with some Whiskey   Hello everyone!  I have been a Reddit lurker for quite some time now, but have clearly never posted before this time.  My wife-to-be bought be "The Ultimate Bar Book" as a Christmas present, and I am not entirely sure she knew what she was getting into.  Whereas before I was basically a Wine drinker who would stay stocked up on Kahlua and Vodka for White Russians (inspired largely by my love for a certain Coen Bros. film), now I am stocking up a nice bar to try all kinds of things.  So, yesterday I came home with a nice grip of liquor, including a pair of whiskeys which were recommended by those posting in this subreddit:  Maker's Mark and Buffalo Trace.  Yesterday I tried the Maker's Mark clean, and found myself to really like it.  I have yet to try the Buffalo Trace, but I plan to try that in the next couple of days.  Then I want to try tastes of them side-by-side, to see if I can distinguish between them.  Interestingly, I basically grew up in a family that loved to drink Jack Daniels (and sometimes Jim Beam), so I am familiar with the whiskey milieu.  I even got to drink some as a youngster during sporting events (Whenever the Avalanche would score a goal in the Stanley Cup).  So, I am excited to branch out a little more, and try some different things.  I was fortunate enough to try some Pappy Van Winkle 15yr last week when a bunch of coworkers went out to a whiskey bar, and I think that is what finally convinced me that I might like whiskey as an adult (a few years back, I tried some Jack Daniels, and didn't much care for it).   In the nest week or so, I expect to get a shipment form Amazon containing some Angostura Bitters and cherries, so that I can make some Manhattans and Old Fashioneds.  In the meantime, I just wanted to pop out from lurking, thank the posters in the reddit for good recommendations, and introduce myself.  Thanks again!
