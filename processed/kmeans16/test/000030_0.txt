I've considered retiring to there.
Thank you!
That's amazing!
It was amazing when I was there. I remember at one point going somewhere and we turned and found the [Alpine Cheese Festival](http://www.myswitzerland.com/en-us/events/event-29543533.html). It was amazing! I want to go back soooooo bad .

Phew! It's all good :D

lol. Fair enough. Needless to say, I've loved the story and have read through it a few times! I can't wait to read what you put out next! Keep up the amazing work!
As a former Coastie, it warms my heart to see this! Thanks and keep up the great work!  I also managed to find all three of your easter eggs!
One thing I would recommend is to give your body like 30 minutes or so to air out each day. Letting your diaper area breathe a bit each day will help cut down on rashes. Also, lots of powder and/or oil or lotion. Which ever you prefer. Other wise enjoy it! What's your go-to diaper for daily wear and wearing at night?
I've been there before! Quite a bit. Thankfully, I've gotten past the binge and purge stage but it's taken a while. I'm at the point where I'll wear (when I can), but I've realized that this is a part of me. I hid it with my ex-wife and let's just say that things did not go well when she found out. But, I wear when I can and have also realized that no one really knows but me. And if anyone **does** figure out, chances are they won't think it's because I enjoy wearing. So, I know it's hard to not feel that shame, but once you accept that it's a part of who you are, and the rest of the world be damned, it gets a lot easier and that shame fades.
