IDGAF if Eric's stats are higher. Yours is way better.   I'm slowly losing my hope in this sub. First Do I Need A Jacket. Then Hexacon. Following with CS: GO post. Everybody is just copying the other. Now it's triangle post. I swear to God that I saw three if them on my scroll down here (9h after upload). The first triangle post even went up two months ago.  Smh  Still respect for changing it up and good job Haha
YOU HAD ONE JOB JOHNNY!!!
Who died?
Thanks!!  I know it's not much but I like the idea.   I used TextTime and set it to be the same color as the wallpaper.   I made it myself

How do schools afford windows PCs?   A windows license key can only be used by one PC at a time.

[Monstercat Visualizer](http://marcopixel.deviantart.com/art/Monstercat-Visualizer-for-Rainmeter-1-2-1-486330771)  [TextTime](http://rainmeterhub.com/skins/textime-1-01/)  I can put up a skin theme when I return from school  Basically I set up eight visualizers. Mapped the frequency ranges. And colored them. Also edited the smoothening variables.

NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC??
Kk...dude
Buddhism not= Hinduism dude.
Porn.
But isn't that kinda a double standard. It's like it's perfectly fine to call a girl beautiful. But if it's a dude... I've only heard gay guys say that a guy was beautiful. And I don't even believe that most gay dudes do. In movies, songs and almost every media girl are call cute, nice, beautiful, bewbs, "that one with the large bootay" etc. But except for cute I've never heard a man being addressed like that... :(
Why am I never satisfied with my purchase?
Chicken = Africa. my friend
Well, I'm kinda a 'jack of all trades - geek'. I just want to learn EVERYTHING. So I've got Photoshop, FL Studio, iTunes and a bunch of Windows and Android Customization Software(I hardly use anymore) on my PC. My question is... what do you "normal" dudes and dudettes use on your PCs
