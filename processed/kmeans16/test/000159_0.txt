You could also look at it as one missed catch (NCState) and one bad quarter of play by EJ Manuel (UF) away from being 13-0 going into bowl season. We had one of the five best defenses in the nation and one of the 10-15 best offenses. Also we finished 8th in the final coaches poll. We were definitely in that range.
Well if you'd like to multiply the probability of each win given certain prior events occurring by the probability of those prior events occurring then be my guest haha, but that's going to get a bit complex for a reddit post. I think this isn't a terrible way to look at your expectations for the season for how simple an exercise it is though.
I'd go even higher - compare his career right now against Bird/Duncan/Kobe/Oscar, and he's got them beat.   I'd go so far as to say if he retired at the end of this season there's an argument for him being as high as third all time behind Kareem/Jordan. I'd say him and Magic are neck and neck; and where he stands next to Chamberlin/Russell depend on how you value championships in 9 team leagues and stats played in games with 50% more possessions.
I appreciated this and I'm sad you're getting downvoted.
Race for the winningest team of the last quarter century   Fun little tidbit: As of this past weekend, there is almost a three-way tie for the most wins of the last 25 years. School records for 1990 to present are:  Nebraska: 238-78-1   Florida:   237-77-1   Florida State: 237-67-1  There are a lot of scenarios that could play out for the title. For instance, the UF/FSU game will probably decide who takes the lead between the two Florida teams. If Florida State makes it to, and wins, the national championship they could win outright; unless Nebraska makes it to, and wins, the the B1G and their bowl game. Nebraska has a tough final two games, and if they lose out Florida could take the lead by upsetting FSU.
In no particular order, I think it will be:  1. Oregon - Survives Stanford, cruises through the final three games, and with a healthier O-line beats whichever Arizona team makes it to the Pac-12 championship game.  2. Kansas State - despite all three remaining tests being on the road, being the one elite big-12 team with very good defense allows them to win out.  3. Notre Dame - I think not falling very far after the loss to FSU benefits this teams greatly, and they make it by winning out.   4. Georgia - For the SEC West, I'm predicting Auburn to lose to UGA but beat Alabama and Ole Miss; Alabama to beat Miss. State and LSU but lose to Auburn; Ole Miss to lose to both Miss. State and Auburn. That leaves Miss St. (who otherwise wins out) the SECw champion at 11-1 and all other teams with at least 2 losses. I think Georgia will beat Miss St. in the SEC championship game and is the only SEC team to make it because no other SEC team ends the season with only 1 loss. (Yes, I realize predicting that many games is ridiculous)  I think Florida State's shady offensive line and lack of run game will collapse against one of the best defenses in the nation this Thursday, and they lose to Louisville and are out of the playoff picture. I'm also predicting Ohio State to win out and beat Michigan State, but with a weak SoS and a bad loss, they end up being one of the one-loss teams on the outside looking in.
Nope
That's nothing like saying the Bulls are just as good without derrick rose; look at their respective records when the pg's are playing and when they're out.   I've been consistently saying that Rondo is not near the elite point guard everyone in /r/nba thinks he is. The guy definitely has a way of sometimes completely taking over a game... but if he's never going to use it in the regular season, and can only get there 15% of the time in the playoffs, then how much can you really ascribe that characteristic to him as a player?
Yeah- it's been pointed out before in this recent influx of 2B1L posts, but most of the time there are enough subtle (and sometimes not-so-subte) differences in the appearance of the cheap outfit that collectively, it would be a terrible outfit.  But then again, this is a user-content oriented site, so I think it's probably an unrealistic expectation for people to be able to compile the entire outfits themselves just for the post.  I've found that I like certain aspects of the full look; things I can take away and mix/match with my own style, in which case both the cheap and the expensive listings can both be helpful depending on how specific a thing I'm looking for. In which case, I think your complaint is just going to have to be an inherent flaw that people live with.
Me too. But I still understand what a joke is.
Ha, okay. I guess you clearly have a well-painted picture of how good FSU is in your head already so I won't argue with you anymore. See you Nov. 24th.
At first I thought the author was just saying "you should find more tactful and creative ways of saying these things." But some of his commentary is just really poor and wrong (see: 2, 7). For 4 and 5 he's just contradicting himself by saying that you *should* say them, but don't do it right away. Well, duh.
2. Can you cite a source then? Do you see how the second sentence doesn't logically validate the first?  5. If you're making an argument against the death penalty, it seems fair to have complaints that are narrowly tailored against the death penalty; and not broad problems with the entire justice system.  7. Spread out across the nation? That's really not much at all, and that amount would likely be doing nothing right now other than easing municipal and state budget crises to a very small degree.   -still upvoted you though because discussion is good.
Yep. Howard has had *no* character problems his first six years (unless you count "being too happy" a character problem). Every negative thing he's done has revolved around his crappy situation with the Orlando Magic management; and I don't entirely blame him, even though he could have handled it much much better. His actual locker room attitude is a non-issue.
Final fantasy VI:  Terra with the 128% MBlock set-up  Mog with Pearl Lance/Dragoon Boots/Dragon Horn  Gau with the Wind God setup; doubling as a physical damage tank.  Edgar Imped    FFVII:   Cloud  Yuffie- because I love her date scene, and she's the coolest character  RedXIII- because nobody ever gives him any love.
The interesting part is that guys can (through their own efforts) reach most of the way to that goal, certainly enough to me a lot more datable. If a girl is ugly then she takes that to the grave.   So I'm not sure which is really worse.
