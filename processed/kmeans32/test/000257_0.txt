banning someone from a cardgame is not vigilante justice
not being serious ;)

I've read a handful of books published in 2014, and I think the book of the year is Smith Henderson's *Fourth of July Creek*
I highly doubt most people are censoring themselves - more a case of thinking "Wow, that guy is a huge dick", and by extension losing interest in the book.  I know personally this is the case for me. If someone like Card wrote something I wanted to read, I'd still read it, just find a way to do so where I'm not monetarily supporting the author...

I really like Bukowski, but I can definitely understand your viewpoint. I think he still has something to offer, but wouldn't fault anyone for not wanting to read him.

Michael Moorcock announces new novel mixing fantasy and autobiography
Unpopular opinion here, but I really hated this book. Found it vaguely interesting at first, but as the book progressed there are just a ton of infodumps, and I started getting very bored. I didn't find it funny at all either, just totally didn't mesh with my sort of humor. Also has one of the worst sex scenes ever written
Cool, that rarely happens and that made me smile.  I can see how he could come off as obnoxious, but stuff like directing As I Lay Dying and Child of God made me respect him, and I've seen him supporting lesser known works like *Scarecrone* by Melissa Broder and *Black Cloud* by Juliet Escoria on his social media. Plus I like his stoner movies :)
Couldn't narrow it down to less than three.   * *The Devil All the Time* by Donald Ray Pollock - southern, gritty, plain awesome  * *Crapalachia* by Scott Mcclanahan - incredible story telling about growing up in West Virginia. Funny and sentimental. Nothing else is like it  * *The Curfew* by Jesse Ball - dystopian novel with poetry like prose and touches of Kafka and David Lynch
A World Made of Words: On Anthony Doerrs Nouns and Verbs
*Silence Once Begun*, like everything Jesse Ball writes, is excellent. Not my favorite of his, but still one of my favorite books released this year.  *Annihilation* is great, bound to be a weird fiction classic. The other two books of the trilogy were not the same quality in my opinion, but the first is a fine stand alone.  *Station Eleven* was an enjoyable read. Great prose mixed with storylines that feel human make it somewhat unique in the overused post apocalyptic genre.  Did not like *Dept. of Speculation*, despite garnering lots of praise.
thank you
You do not need to explain it to me like I'm a child - I understand the changes.  With the new changes, they removed a primary motivator for many people to pay this game - going infinite. They already added casual draft, does this game need to cater to casual players 100 percent of the time? Nobody would be complaining if they left the competitive tournament queue payouts the same with all of the other positive changes.
REVIEW: 300 Million by Blake Butler
Rather than saying "Wow, OP", why not try to add some actual discussion to the card? I do not think this card is very strong. It's a mediocre card. Visions of drawing 2 Antonidases, Rags, etc, are flowing through everyone's heads, And maybe if a control mage type deck becomes playable, this card could be a strong lategame piece.   For draft? It's pretty bad, worse than arcane intellect in my opinion. Every competent draft player plays around secrets already, so this card clashes hard with a lot of cards - hex, imp master, razorfen hunter, harvest golem token, silverhand recruit, violet teacher, etc.    You will of course get some nice value some of the time, but most times, the card is going to be way harder to successfully pull off than you think, especially in draft.
do your own homework
you're an idiot
OK, there is a background to most of the stuff, so maybe Deus Ex Machina is the slightly wrong term. Nonetheless Stephenson continually uses futuristic technology throughout the book to get his characters out of impossible situations, so I think it applies. Certainly didn't make it any less groan inducing... I mean, he uses the Rat Things twice if I'm remembering correctly - don't they also save YT during the snow crash pickup? (In addition to running miles at warp speed at the end to save the day and take down the main villain?)

Seriously? Solforge is pretty fun but it is super pay to win. The free to play rewards I get are most often a small amount of silver and a common I have numerous copies of. The Drafts are great, but as a f2p player expect to be able to play one every week if you're lucky.  Constructed is really dependent on legendaries (hope you got lucky and have 3 Thundersaurs!) and incredibly unbalanced - at least when N/T Shapers was completely dominant you only needed a few legendaries - Zimus, Phoenix, etc. Now that A/U Weirwood Thundersaur is the best deck by a country mile, hope you have thundersaurs, blightsteel gargoyles, 2/4 free robot guy, etc
Interesting line, not sure if it's better to coin on turn 1 or 2. Turn 1 gives you 3 extra damage on turn 2 at the cost of a -1 attack on one of your wurms.  Keeping the wurms at 4 seems good, but assuming it's constructed and not arena, SW:D isn't that highly played anymore (or is it? seems like I've been seeing less and they aren't very good), and you are going to get SW:P'd on his turn 2 if he has it regardless.
It is definitely a cumulative experience - the more you read, the more you want to read, and the easier it becomes. Find an author or genre you like to read and start there, but don't be afraid to branch out into new genres or experiences. Reading is the best, welcome.
I wouldn't call Hearthstone "blatantly pay-to-win", especially since arena mode isn't pay to win in the slightest. As for constructed, it's a CCG, what do you expect
SIB Conquest of Elysium 3?   It is currently on sale for 2.50 on steam, but I'm more concerned if it's worth my time than the money, as my time to game is becoming scarce.  I don't know much about the game, but enjoy the rpg/srpg genre. I am cool with old school as well, have played and enjoyed baldurs gate, planescape, avernum, etc, though I play many games from a wide variety of genres. Thanks!
Looking for a fun local co-op game to play with my wife   Looking for something fun to pass the time - I'm a big gamer, and my wife is no stranger to gaming either, but not as hardcore.  We have been looking for something fun on emulator (nes/snes/genesis), but can't find much that isn't a button mashing beat em up. Next gen suggestions are ok too, as well as pc.  Things we have played - Castle crashers Secret of mana Legend of the mystical ninja Various snes beat em ups Lego games (not a big fan, though she is)  Thanks in advance
