You just need to update your post to say that you are a parent   that was teeth gritting. like i said, "i don't want the average redditor to know the personal details of my life". i don't think i'll choose to participate. "we" as moderators sometimes are caught in between a hard place and a rock when upholding the rules of the subs we govern and i understand this and this is just one of those very rare times. thank you for your time and have a good weekend.

Thank you deejne for your submission! Unfortunately, your post has been removed for the following reason(s):  ***It breaks rule 1:*** **Use the correct title formatting.** Titles should be to the point, and all extra information or context should be added in the comments.   Here is how you should format it -   Your artwork - "Title, Medium, Size"    Also remember no extraneous information in the title means do not state that it's your first time using a medium in the title, or write 'Hey Reddit', 'What do you think?' 'A ____ I did' or any variation or be subjective in the title ("awesome work," "amazing piece" etc). Also do not mention your 'cake day' or use karma-bait titles.

Welcome to Peterotica on tape. I'm Betty White reading "The Hot Chick Who Was Italian or Maybe Some Kind of Spanish" by Peter Griffin. Chapter one, Oh god, you should have seen this one hot chick. She was totally Italian...or maybe some kind of Spanish.
i used all 300 characters. can anyone tell?    Torre Abraham Lincoln, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Construction on the two circular 36-story towers remains empty and unfinished since construction was halted in 1974. Conceived as the centrepiece of Lucio Costas modernist plan for the region, the Torre Abraham Lincoln buildings were intended to be the first in a series of 76 individual towers. The plan was eventually abandoned due to poor material choices and the inability to secure enough of the projects land due to private ownership.   more additional pics and history of the failed project: http://paraisoocupado.com/?paged=2  note, there are two of these that stand side by [side](http://img.weburbanist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/abandoned-skyscrapers-torre-barra-rio.jpg)
