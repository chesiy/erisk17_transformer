Maybe someone can enlighten me please,  Is wage "appropriately" adjusted to our current inflation? If minimum is $15, does that also mean the current minimum wage for jobs that require experience and education such as,  a nurse for example, need to rise as well? Facts , or opinions based on facts would be nice.  I'm just trying to explore through dialogue.

Went to Iraq in 03 and 04. now that the dust has settled, a day doesn't go by that I realize how they used me for something other than what I thought I was fighting for. I was young and naive, I hope the guys out there are at least better informed.
