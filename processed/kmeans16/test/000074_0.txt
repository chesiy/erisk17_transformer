I'm glad you picked up on the condescension, because I was doing it as loud as I could.   There were only three images from the Iraq war out of twenty-four. This sub isn't for mocking and making light of the dead. Whether or not you agree with a country's policies, it's undeniable that nations need militaries in order to defend themselves. There's no reason to shit on those men and women who are drafted or volunteer to serve and sacrifice for their countries. If you want to talk about politics go to /r/politics or any other sub where that is the topic of conversation and they tolerate disrespecting the dead. You're clearly violating the rules of this sub by ridiculing the suffering of others.
Mathematically, as income goes down a fixed tax like a sales tax will increase as a percentage of ones income. Your ideas suck because 1) sales tax is a discretionary tax. Since rent, car payments, food and I some cases clothing are not subject to sales tax, what IS subject is the discretionary items. If we give low income earners a break on the sales tax on the big flat screen, maybe we are just paying for them to go from the 40 to the 50 incher. That should not be my responsibility.  If you want to have an honest discussion about who should pay for our governments services, I'm certain that it's not the governments role to supersize tvs.  Again, my state charges sales tax on food. People who buy cars pay sales taxes on them. Not everything in a person's home is discretionary. People need refrigerators, laundry machines, ovens, and other appliances to live and those things are taxed. You repeatedly bringing up televisions amounts to basic hateful demagoguery. You might as well be Reagan with his racist caricature of the Cadillac driving "Welfare Queen". You continue to ignore the taxes that the poor pay on food, clothing, appliances, services, utilities, and everything else that costs money.   The idea also that the all of the non taxpayers are retirees and handicapped people is farcical since it's fully 50% of working age people. The demographics aren't even close to being in your favor. Last your ideas suck because every outside source you cited supported my viewpoint - the nominal tax rates, the bogus nytimes stat and the last citing that confirmed half pay nothing.  Those 50% that you're talking about don't even earn enough to feed themselves and their families. I've repeated this in every reply since you first mentioned them. This thread is a discussion about allowing them to earn an income that sustains life, and here you are complaining and alluding to them being lazy moochers. What good would it be to tax people who aren't able to cover their basic food and shelter requirements? Are they going to be more productive workers and* students when they're homeless and starving? How would that serve society?
You had to show four forms of ID? That smells like bovine excrement to me. I only had to present my social security card and birth certificate. What other forms of ID did you need? Your identification pony? Your family crest and a lock of your great grandfather's hair?   Edit: Your ultrasound and a vaginal swab from your mother? Your library card and three copies of your Subway Sub Club card? Your passport and a facsimile of your ass? A years worth of toenail clippings, a portrait of your dog, and a stool sample? This is a lot of fun, thanks.

Are you trying to say that /r/coontown and other subs like it need exposure in order to exist because that's not really true. Most of these controversial subs get most of their traffic through word of mouth. If users don't log in they can't vote, post, or comment so who cares about them. People who opt out of seeing this side of reddit will miss out on a lot more than just a few hateful subs. Most people will want to see at least some of that content so this isn't going to exclude enough people to directly kill any of those communities.   This wouldn't necessarily hurt any subs, but it will allow reddit to isolate that content and sell ad space for better or worse.
So you don't have a source.   Because what I'm saying is that Jim Crow laws were unconstitutional and once challenged they were thrown out by the applicable courts including SCOTUS. An attorney should not be telling anyone to break the law, but they can render an opinion on whether a statute is lawful and constitutional. In this case the SCOTUS has already determined the constitutionality of same sex marriage. Senator Cruz knows the law. He's not rendering an opinion, he's advising public employees to disobey the law which is very clear.
That's a trend that started just before the Civil War when the south argued that a state didn't have the right to refuse to enforce a federal law they didn't agree with (the fugitive slave acts), that the people of a state didn't have the right to prohibit slavery (because slavery should be an "inalienable right"), and again after the war when trying to whitewash what they'd done ("the Civil War was about states rights"). Kinda shows how far we've come. Up to that point the assholes always won.
That's terrible.
The majority of Christians don't believe in hell as an actual place? That's bullshit. I live right smack dab in the middle of Christian America and I can assure you that you're wrong. Every one of these people believe I'm going to burn in hell for eternity and they feel intense Schadenfreude at the mere idea.   No I quoted two* different parts. The big Mathew part was comprised of consecutive passages, granted the formatting sucked, but it was one part of the scripture. I don't think it's morally sound to turn your back on family because they don't believe the same things you do. The last part about losing one's life for Christ and achieving eternal life sounds an awful lot like the martyrs of islam.
I remember them mostly being **a lot** of rain and wind. The article describes this one as being about as strong as a level 2 or 3 hurricane so just watch the news and avoid going outside when the news advises against it. They have bilingual news in a lot of places over there.
Thanks for the info.   He wasn't being unruly. He was sitting down holding a camera with both hands. They definitely could have done more to communicate and reason with the guy. You can say it was justified all you want, but if that old man (as cantankerous and obnoxious as he is) were to have been shot and killed, or anyone else in that room had been shot and killed, all of this would have been a moot issue. Those guards are there to protect everyone in that room and they undoubtedly failed.
Explain to me OP, how this is more of a failure of the president than it is the legislature. Each time a reasonable bill is presented to properly fund any amount of reform, the GOP dominated legislature slashes and trims it* into ineffectualism. It's convenient to attack the president, but a little research will reveal to you that the bill he supported was defeated and replaced with a joke that provides one tenth of the funding as was intended.
I'm not sure what you're getting at. I personally think this kid should have to do a couple of years in juvenile or some kind of Center for youth offenders. But it's not my decision to make.   What happened to that girl is terrible and the offender needs to be dealt with. I'm assuming you're an American by your vengeful attitude and you posting this shitty article that mentions Anders Breivik as if he was somehow relevant to this case. Perhaps you can put your thirst for blood aside and consider the long term consequences of incarceration and what goals are ultimately meant to be achieved.
I've experienced some of that. The last time I got a new prescription, I hadn't been wearing glasses for a few months because they were broken. When I received the new pair my tablet appeared to be a slight trapezoid instead of perfect rectangle for a couple of weeks. I had to be careful going up and down stairs. Thanks for the info, Doc.
Way to continue to spread misinformation without providing any sources of your own. Did you go on to read about the control group under the influence of alcohol and drugs? The increased risk is almost identical.   The fact that you're ignoring the data and continuing to demonize the mentally ill is fucking offensive. Instead of relying on your gut feelings and biases, read the data.
I wasn't suggesting that all such incidents were the same. OP claimed that most were armed and therefore justified. I think that both of those claims are questionable.   If you've spent any amount of time on this sub you would know that we there are countless cases where the police made a judgement call that led to the death of another person, the circumstances were suspicious, and most often the police aren't even investigated. Why should I waste my time collecting all of these stories for a police apologist who has access to the same search engines, this sub, and who won't even bother reading anyway?
