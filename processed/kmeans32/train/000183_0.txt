how did you make the water?
Question about r/WorldBuilding   Can people use this subreddit for book/story ideas, or is it just for maps and fantasy worlds. I've got an idea for a story and would like some feedback on it, but i dont know if this is the subreddit to do that.  Thanks!
New Nuke Release Date Prediction   Valve released the first Train teaser on June 1st, 2014; They then released the full map on December 10th, 2014. 6 months later.  Possibly using this time frame we can predict when the new Nuke will be released.  Valve released the first Nuke teaser on March 31, 2015.   I presume we will get the new Nuke sometime in September.  Or they could be completely unrelated and have nothing to do with each other, that could be a possibility.
as in what? its mean just to be a country border map
very creative
finally
yeah its pretty bad
where did you find the hunting scope
go inland
fnaf timeline theory   1. Shadow Bonnie and Phantom Freddy are the replacement / temporary suits that employees wear, to Springtrap and Golden Freddy.  2. Purple Guy #1 (http://i.imgur.com/6FU0a95.png) kills The Puppet Child on the street and the 5 children using Golden Freddy at Fredbear's Diner, and later is caught and arrested. (maybe the calls in FNaF2 are pre-recorded)  3. Purple Guy #2 / Night Guard ((http://i.imgur.com/G5vDChg.png) maybe before Jeremy?) does something unknown? to make the spirits hate him.  4. The Puppet controls the Toy Animatronics to kill the night guard in FNaF2.  5. Toy animatronics are scrapped and possessed animatronics are repaired for FNaF1 (presumably The Puppet is also scrapped).  6. The events of FNaF1 take place.  7. After FNaF1 the possessed animatronics are destroyed by Purple Guy #2 and the spirits sp00k him into Springtrap, killing him.  (afterthoughts) If the calls form FNaF2 AREN'T pre-recorded, and the 5 children are killed DURING FNaF2, why are the old animatronics from Fredbear's being possessed?  If you have any idea to fill holes or ideas in general, comment below and let me know

Firstly, i know thats not how heightdata works, its just a basic placeholder so i know where i will eventually put them, and build around them and not worry about elevation. And thanks for the additional tips, ill be sure to keep them in mind
'Molunova' DayZ/ArmA 3 map idea progression   So i have added some new ideas to my map (it is still just a drawing that i have moved from paint into paint.net to allow me to have more freedom to do assorted things) First, some 'story' about parts of the map. the northern most city, "North City" has a tall wall going around the surrounding area. Players will need special clothes in order to survive the radiation of north city for more than a minute. North City will have lots of military loot and will (hopefully) be a hotspot for players to go to to get good gear. This idea isn't even 10% done, so any feedback would be highly appreciated.  http://imgur.com/dhDhOZO
get better

DayZ map idea   Do you think this would be a good idea for a map? http://imgur.com/794nwoj the image is taken from http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=5343 with some slight adjustmants to orientation. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. (This map is only for me to see the tepography, i already have a basic version of it here: http://imgur.com/CGxj8CQ )
