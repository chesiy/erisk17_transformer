I dream of being able of turning my house into a haunted house every year. How much do you think a transformation like this would cost?
The nightmare of every child
Giant of the deep
There be monsters in the deep (art)
Yay! I'm glad that I'm not the only one who is terrified of Monstro !
Definitely odd, but not creepy.
Just love Ol' Blue Eyes!!
Most jello products or food with gelatin is made with fruit pectin. No animals!
ECAR and ECAW?   Hey fellow teachers, In August I will be teaching at a new school(7-12). The current Language Arts teacher is very, very into ECAR(every child a reader) and ECAW(every child a writer). I have done a little research into this program, and it seems to be geared towards elementary age kids, not middle school(what I teach). I am very hesitant to adopt this new teaching program. Any thoughts out there? Are there benefits?
oh wow...that sounds like a difficult situation.
Lovely!

Beautifully put! I definitely think that I am going to wait three years!
Lovely! I love how the characters actually look like themselves. Sometimes tattoos distort their faces...not this one !
Over plan, over plan, over plan!  Make sure that you are rather firm on your classroom procedures and expectations from day 1. Once you have a relationship with your kids, you can ease up on management.  Depending on your grade level, make sure that the first week (unless high school) is really just get to know you activities, team building things, expectations, etc.  Take a deep breath!
YIN, Yang!!
