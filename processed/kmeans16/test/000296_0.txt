[Noriko Takaya](http://imgur.com/ONQq4fc) from Gunbuster. Not only is she pretty, but she digs giant robots (and hers is fucking huge, even by giant robot standards). Top it all off with being written as a human, not just a heroine for a cheesy mech show, and you've got the absolute best girl in all of anime.
Maybe stating his true feeling on squares is what broke up Square Mom? IT WAS SOMETHING YOU DID!

This is absolutely satire. It's even making fun of one of the worse (non-satire) minion memes, in which "a big black man raping you in the ass" is replaced by "if people are talking behind your back"

Gurren Lagann:  -remove that one episode where all the pointless side characters died to fill some space. (Not Kittan obviously since he was important, but everyone else)  -episode 4. Fuck.   -shorten the "serious" arc where they were on Earth post-time skip  -maybe extend the final fight by like 7 minutes  -add a giant new form of TTGL made out of Kamina's soul  -give Yoko a Tengen Toppa Titty Tank  -maybe make it into two movies
The End of Evangelion, because it is literally the ending to the TV series. It was what they intended before they ran out of money. It also happens to be one of the greatest films ever made in my own opinion, so absolutely check that out.   After you clean your brains off of the wall behind you, you may want to move on to the Rebuild saga. 1.11 is a remake of the episodes until the fifth angel, 2.22 deviates into its own story, and 3.33 is completely different.
Evangelion and Gurren Lagann tell the same story from two points of view   Neon Genesis Evangelion and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. Two Gainax mechas, considered by many to be the pinnacle of their genre. So is it possible that they're really one and the same?   Both feature a magical power based on the soul of the user, namely AT fields and Spiral Power. They both serve many purposes, the main one being an "explain everything" scapegoat. The main antagonists of the shows (SEELE and the Antispiral) wish to rid the universe of ATSpiral as it is an evolutionary dead end that will lead the universe to destruction.   Let's look at the Antispiral, actually. It's a being formed from the collective souls of a spiral race formed into one. SEELE wanted to complete the Human Instrumentality Project to being their species into one collective consciousness and rid themselves of the need for individual AT Fields. They also have proven to be fans of giant robots, which would explain the Granzeboma. So Gurren Lagann could be a reality in which Third Impact went according to plan, and SEELE got to try and rid the universe of humanity.
Jesus runs a Jesus-figure gauntlet   All of these fighters can be argued as messiah figures after J-Dawg's own image.   This is post-crucifixion Jesus  1: Gordon Freeman. All weapons allowed. (He's beloved, bearded, messianic supersoldier)  2: The Terminator 2 T-800 (Half man, stuggles between being objectively superior to humans and also being a human. Saves the world from its own hubris. Pretty much applies from here on out)  3: Kaworu Nagisa, Evangelion  4: Eva Unit-01, Shinji piloting  5: Eva Unit-01, berserk  6: Post-Crisis Superman  7: Superman Prime 1M  And any others you think should be on the list.
Can one of you roaches get me a gif of Schumel and Cherry Dude at the end of Mountain Hiker 2?   I like that shot where they're hugging and amir is in Annette, but I'm a loser and a Jew who can't edit worth shit. Can one of you coy divas make it for me?
ELIJ: Neon Genesis Evangelion   Nigguh wut the fuk
Zilla vs Jurassic Park   [Zilla](http://godzilla.wikia.com/wiki/Zilla) (not real Godzilla, the one from the 1998 movie) gets dropped into Jurassic Park during the events of the first movie right after the outbreak, meaning Jeff Goldblum and Samuel L. Jackson are still there.   Round 1: Victory is earned by becoming recognized Queen of the Dinosaurs (to stick it to *real* Godzilla).   Round 2: Victory is earned by not becoming Queen, but her species maintaining a presence on the island living alongside all the other dinosaurs (to pretend she has nothing to do with *real* Godzilla).   Round 3: She, and only she, must murder every creature on the island. No kids, just murder. No presence, just murder.
Mewtwo* vs. The multiverse   Mewtwo is sentient like in the movie, with stats and moves from X and Y. He has a completely filled trainer's bag and has again kidnapped Nurse Joy, as well as a move re-learner. He has both Mega Stones, but can only carry one at a time. His Nurse and Move Tutor stay behind when he goes to fight, so if he wants to heal he has to leave and come back. His goal, using the creation trio to travel between universes, is to take all of them over by killing or recruiting (Mystery Dungeon style) all of their strongest fighters. For example, he has to kill every legendary pokemon who refuses to cooperate, every Godzilla monster, the entire Justice League, etc. Can he do it? If not, who stops him?
Was Hans really necessary?   I mean, I love Frozen, and what they did with him. But he wasn't... *needed*. He could have been cut out of the movie entirely and his screentime could have been put towards character development of the other three. He does provide a shocking reveal, but that really feels more like it was to justify his presence. Other than that, he's just an antagonist for the sake of being an antagonist, which almost seems like it was shoehorned in at the last minute. I'm just not convinced he needed for the story the movie was telling.
How do I get the Pimp-Boy 3 Billion on a good character?   My character is liked by New Vegas and I want to keep it that way. The guides I've seen all point me to the bad path, but the wiki says you can complete it and get New Vegas fame and the Pimp-Boy. So how do you meet the "special conditions"?
Quick question, don't upvote.   Sorry if this is the wrong sub, but I've been wanting to get some Pokemon ROM hacks on my 3DS. I don't want to buy a flash cart, but I do have an SD card. Thanks in advance.
