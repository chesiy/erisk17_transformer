Chef's salad -- leftovers never tasted so good
yup, same engine.  Love the B5's.  Just got the brakes, tires   wheels upgraded and this thing drives like a dream now.
Any love for a B5 S4 Avant? [3264  2448]
Why does he have to be Hawaiian?
Did you try the Exercise app?

Just checked out Bromst.  Solid stuff.  I feel like I've heard of him over the years but never took the time to listen.
you definitely should!  there's a small group of us and we're always looking to network further and find new DJs.  I'm trying to put together a lineup right now for another house residency here in the city.  If anyone has good venue recommendations please let me know!
I just meant that both the run ups on TSLA and TWTR were fueled by bullish sentiment and shorts covering their positions.  TSLA more so than TWTR.  the short float (% of float sold short) for TWTR is now just 5%, TSLA's is 48%.  Short squeezes have seemed to factor a bunch lately in these mini-stock bubbles.  It's great if you can take the plunge early and get in, but you have to be quick on the trigger for exiting.  Getting in at the peak and having no safety net in the form of stop loss orders is a recipe for a personal shame spiral.
thanks man...just found out about /r/house this past month
