A true story: have you ever felt the storm coming?   Today at work, I was doing fine till the afternoon when I messaged her.  I knew it was over. I could feel it. Today, the depression would hit me. It had been a few months. No. Almost a year. But I could see the snowflake falling in my head. I could see its trajectory, and I could see the avalanche that it would cause.  I had to be really careful. I'd escaped before. I just had to keep focused on work. Fuck. Why wasn't she replying?   *Those are the kind of thoughts that will lead you down the path. Focus on the work. Get the job done*  Had she replied? I checked my phone and got a beer. Maybe the beer would help. I drank it quickly. Nope. Bad idea.  I needed to get out of there. I decided to walk home, but then saw the bus and got on instead.   When i got off the bus, I felt afraid of the evening that lay ahead. It was less than a block that I had to walk. Each step increased my dread. I'd never, ever felt this before. I knew that I would go home and burst into tears. Nothing would stop it now. Except if I didn't go home.  Yes, that was it. I just had to take a walk. The thought was there, but I kept moving towards my house. I felt like I was a chained by my hands and was being dragged along the floor. I helplessly watched my legs carry me up the stairs.   I methodically checked my mail, unlocked the door, put my keys and badge in their place, locked the door, took off my shoes, went into my bedroom, covered myself with my blanket and burst into tears. They flowed peacefully and silently, accompanied only by the sound of my refrigerator humming. I should have gotten that fixed long back.  I stopped crying, got up and decided to write this.  The rest of the evening beckons, and I have to go. Thank you for reading.
If you're prepared to add a day or two to your trip, you can go camp out in the Whitney area and look for permits every day. A lot of people apply for the lottery and cancel/never show up/show up in smaller groups than planned.  A ranger told me he's always had a few walk-in permits issues...every  day when the visitor center opens. Just go for it!   Also, you can climb one of the "lesser" mountains.   I had way more fun on Mt. Dade than on Mt. Whitney. Even though I didn't even reach the top of Dade. Whitney was so much easier, crowded and less fun overall. Though the views are great.
I don't think the balance is fine at all. I'm heavily on your side in this argument. Googling is okay, I guess, only as long as you make sure you're understanding what's going on enough to not make the same mistake.   And that understanding is kind of enforced if you don't have Google...   Well... The line is kind of fine :-)
Okay I can't really decide if it's 21 (10.5 x 2) or 10x2... My brain can't keep up with the song...Any drummers here care to chip in?  EDIT: http://www.jazz.com/music/2008/2/5/mahavishnu-orchestra-celestial-terrestrial-commuters  It says it's 9/8 :(
Good!  I mean...well you know what I mean :)
Yes, you and me both :) Even his story is pretty cool...  The original post:  http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/124eyg/the_best_thing_i_ever_did_was_sell_all_my_pro/
I had read a few articles in Scientific American about this. Two are attached. I'm not qualified myself to answer this question and any knowledge I can give will be a subset of these, since my knowledge comes from there. One of them is from 1975 (the pdf) and the other one more recent:  1/ http://www.scientificamerican.com/media/pdf/2008-05-21_1975-carroll-story.pdf  2/ http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=sean-carroll-eternity-to-here  The tl;dr seems to be entropy
Thanks for the link!
Thanks a lot for the advice! Evidently, I'm trying to bite off far more than I can chew for now ;-)   Will try to get a heart monitor from somewhere and a foam roller!
I'm not sure. I came back one day and it was gone. It wasn't even very expensive, but it was new (replaced due to many flats). I was locking the frame and the front wheel thinking the back wheel would be fine because it takes more time to get it out. Oh well.  Strangely enough, when I first got the bike, the seat was stolen, but the thief was nice enough to leave an inferior seat on the bike so I wouldn't be left without one!
Oh yes yes maybe. I have the ATT version and the T-mobile one has more than mine for sure.  But it doesn't _really_ matter. There are always devs porting ROMs all around the place.  EDIT: Not sure where you can check this. But galaxys2root.com is a good place for the S2. If you just poke around XDA long enough, you'll suddenly find one day that you have an opinion!
Post-processing   I started taking pictures a few years back and didn't do any processing. More so because I was lazy to learn than anything else.  My photostream is here: http://www.flickr.com/photos/pritamps (Just lost pro status, sorry!). None of the photos on there are processed. I used to be proud of that for some reason.   Now, I'm ready. I have Lightroom installed and want to learn the basics (color adjustments, tonal curves etc.)  Are there some good tutorials about this? Books or something along the lines that give me an idea of what good processing is would be good as well!  I did check out r/Lightroom, but it's not active at all..  EDIT: Thanks a lot for all your suggestions! Lynda.com it is!! :)
Wow... this is awesome. Here's what I said on another poem right here on this subreddit, today:  "I think your content is good, but you seem to be in the same boat as me. We need to edit much, much more. I'm having to be frank with you, but you (and I, that's why I'm saying this) aren't "natural" poets -- the kind that write a masterpiece in one sitting. We have poetic thoughts, then we put them down. But without refinement, we are just stones on a beach."   Thanks!!!
I tried again and again for 4 years before finally giving up on trying to be confident. After 8 months of soul-wrenching self-reflection and a reasonable amount of hurting myself, I decided the following:  I'll make a small change, and stick to it. I won't worry about any other problem. I can't work? It's okay. I can't sleep? It's okay. I am disappointing people who think the world of me? It's okay. The world sucks and the girl I love is fucking someone else? It's okay. I just turn the other cheek and let the world slap me there. I am a loser and by definition, losers don't win. That's okay too.  As long as I can exercise regularly, everything else doesn't matter. The hope is that once I'm able to exercise regularly, I can take the next step. And some days, I can't get out of my bed. That's fine too. I'll just let those days go by and wait for the day I get out and go to gym.  The point is the hope, of course. Exercise gives me endorphins and for all I know, the endorphins might be what's letting me live.  I post to r/Fitness and get encouragement from there. I see stories on reddit and I laugh.   I'm not sure what I'm trying to say to you any more. But I went through all that you did. Maybe not or maybe my situation was worse, we can never be sure. But remember it does not matter that others think of you as a failure.   I am afraid sometimes that my family will see me for what I am and their hopes will come crashing down. But these days, I have learned to accept that too. I am what I am. This acceptance sometimes make me smile and sometimes it makes me punch walls.   But whatever I am, I will exercise regularly and then sleep well, and then dress well. And then we'll see. Fuck everything else.  I'm not sure I'm getting my point across at all, but I hope your understanding is better than my expression.
I didn't realize the mistake there, and kept wondering how the first sentence and the rest were connected!
Oh the caste system exists and is alive and well. People marry in the same caste. People kill for caste. People look away for caste. People get reservations for caste. People get votes for caste. Like you say, the exceptions (us, probably?) don't make the rules  And there are brahmins who eat meat religiously too (fish eaters in the coastal regions), though I agree, they are a minority. I'm a brahmin and I'm vegetarian :)   Ninja EDIT : I mean, I WAS vegetarian :P
