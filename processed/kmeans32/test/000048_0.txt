I need more of that sweet karma
Stalin purged the Bolsheviks(including his right hand man who was a jew) the majority of whom were jewish, yes stalin was a paranoid idiot who was always fearful of allowing others to gain power but he also had a deep seated hatred of the jewish people, most Russians did and do, they have always been scapegoats, just look up the pogroms the soviets conducted against regular non Bolshevik Jewish communities. Sorry i'm trying to finish a paper but I will source the link where it is mentioned this stopped his forward mobility in the party rank's, btw the quote in question was pre-Stalin era, this is in reference during Lenin's rule.
Not really. The concept of a Palestinian is recent, the majority arrived from jordan,egypt and Syria respectively. Their not that diverse and they came in the 1800's. You can look at the majority of their last names in it shows their origins. Stop trying to state they date back 2,000 years that's a lie used by arafat a egyptian from cairo with a syrian uncle who was a nazi.
Yes. That's how the han chinese can tell one of their own from a Uighur and vice versa yet if i go to china my first thought will be all of them look alike no offense to the china men:)
Being born and raised in a african country does not make you african. Like me being born in germany does not make me german. Does not matter she's still a boer, just because the country is called south africa does not make her an african. I'm a american due to my country name, but i'm not a native american even though due to my great grandfather being blackfoot i can legally claim as such. Damn white people always trying to steal our culture, history and ethnic classifications.
Um look at our expansion westward, who ever gets to the land first is the rightful owner. There's two established ways to get land rights throughout history, be there first or have a bigger weapon to kill those who were there first.  Wtf are you on about , look up the mayan,aztec, Inca civilizations across not, south and central america, then look up the first nations before their Armageddon occurred they had earth mounts made up of dirt from across the united states, interconnected trade routes, theirs a township around Georgia or north Carolina i believe with a population at it's height which outnumbered medieval London.
It's kind of funny that some people don't consider this hacking, you should look up the early day's of hacking going back to the 70's when people would use stuff like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phreaking  using nothing more then sound these guys could hack long distance calls, which in the 70's/80's was a huge thing, it would be the equivalent of unlimited minutes/texting back in the early 2,000's without paying a goddamn cent. Man hacking goes way back, we think of it as computers and crazy tech geeks deciphering some computer code in then using it to rob people's data from a bogus ip address listed in the Caribbean but it is so much more.
Not a girl but the biggest instance of me missing a signal from a girl was back in high-school. My little brothers sister(different dads, different moms) no relation outside of my little bro, anyway she randomly started hanging around me whenever she would come over to visit my lil bro, one day while she was spending the night over our house(this was long after my mom and her dad had ended but she was still close to our family) she came to my room, asked me to come into our living-room, i sat next to her, one thing led to another and i lost my virginity that night.   Anyway a few weeks later, she calls my house, i pick up in she starts talking about how she wants to come over and hangout again and asked could she speak to my mom, my mom and her are on the phone, she ask my mom, mom looks over at me wondering if i want to be bothered i blurt out mom no! because despite the fact we had sex i really could not stand her or her sister, my mom also did not want to be bothered so she made up an excuse in said maybe next time. I later realized what she was hinting at when she said hang out again about 3 months later. F%#$
Brazil for one.
Can confirm this guy punches.
Not you granny. But i have heard from others calling it fluid. In sorry for that then, but you can't decide rather or not my opinion is being nitpicky because sources you're using to validate your statements are not holding up. The point of any source is to be critiqued because this is what you're basing it entirely on. That's very true, in if the concept of gender has progressed and greatly change isn't it wrong to assume our current understanding and view of it is completely null in concerns to historical gender identity?  That's why i referenced the elven crossdresser, what we see as signs of transgenderism, how we view it in that historical and cultural context it can be completely unrelated. The link you posted even states the same at the very bottom. Monks and philosophers actually would not be included but alchemist most definitely, interesting read on the subject of how it was coined  http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=127037417  Imagine if they had chosen atheist, god the 1950's would of been hell on earth for the scientific community. You are popularizing futuristic concepts, just dropped the atomic bomb and split the atom a few years before, the world is hypothesizing new concepts while at the same time people scared of commies are forcing god into everything and here you're, the atheist.   Sorry once again history major here, that's not factual, much like theories in science we can study events, source historical accounts, if need be excavate and then of course compare in theorize based on the available evidence what occurred. History is literally reading between the lines, which is one of the reasons why it's fascinating. The one thing we cannot do to a fault is really the mindset of historical individuals we can surmise their personalities, traits, and how they might of been but this is all really a opinionated guess which is one of the reasons why i dislike when people try in post their mindsets on historical figures and events. Those who do this usually have a political objective, which honestly i do not mind, but be honest about, if you want to lay claim to Alexander the great being homosexual for the purpose of giving a historical figure that gay young adults can look up to fine but their is a a point we should respect.
Duggar is that you? you cannot wish the pedo away like the gay, it does not work like that, it's not 2 for 1 my friend. Normal families would not protect and allow their son to molest his younger sisters or send him to counseling with a a man later convicted of having kiddie porn. They have proven repeatedly that their method was ineffedctive.
Tell that to the sikhs.
No were not claiming anything. We simply stated we could compete if soccer was more popular in america, just like we could compete if cricket became more popular in america. This is not a claim but a well established facts, america does amazing in the Olympics. On a international scale we repeatedly shown we're definitely top ten in most sports.  I could give a fuck all about your football, but stop acting like you idiots have a set recipe for making great football players. England invented the sport in they suck at it, yet i here people making the same bullshit excuses about how america is only good at sports we invent. I have no idea who does guys are, so i have nothing to compare them too. It's not about having 6ft tall beast though, you are stereotyping because you have a onesided view of american athleticism, we have 300+ people we're not all Michael jordans, have you seen american quarter backs? look at brett favre? you call him a example of athleticism, a QB does not have to be a adonis of athleticism to be good or even great at the game some of the best one's were couch potato's. we can find 5ft7 guys just like we found the women for soccer.  But to do that we need coaching staff, we need people to actually care about the sport. Jesus this is why america does not care about world opinion, you assume we're ignorant and not conscientious then are shocked when you're proven wrong. You guys are the most elitist jackasses i have ever seen, all we're stating is that we could compete, just like we always do and we could be good. Because guess what, that's what being an american is, even if we suck we don't give in, we keep practicing and trying harder. We don't believe in defeatism or relegating ourselves to being underdogs. Maybe you guys should stop being assholes in maybe try learning this thing called sportsmanship? oh wait no you guys are just a bunch of ultra nationalist who use football to talk shit about other countries while decrying america as a hive of uberpatriots fuck off.
Yes i'm well aware, it was also non existent until very recently for their to be any kind of terrorist attack in Iraqi Kurdistan and it's extremely peaceful compared to well any other part of iraq. In yeah but i agree, their maybe some islamist factions but of course there are, kurds are in the middle-east, it would be surprising if this was not the case  but atleast the kurds stick up to their radicals and implement moderation and secularism which is more then then allot of other countries do.
Sorry i was being rhetorical in reference to Reddit and it's moderators/admins being idiots. In the pedophile reference was to a front page post about Germany providing therapy to pedophiles in how the entire comment section was a bunch of pity post saying how pedo's were not bad people and got a bad rep in some other crap, basically a circle jerk of pedo supporters. In no i was not referring to you personally stating this, i was referring to how the new ceo of reddit officially gave them a pass.
Starwars republic commando, say what you will about consoles but that was one of the most graphically beautiful games i have ever played. One of the best looking in that generation and funnest game play experience i ever had. Nothing beat taking over a confederate ship and firing upon another with the hacked cannons while fighting off super battle-droids. PLUS I MUST FIND SEV!!!
He's referring to the fact that there are millions of Muslims and not that many Christians. There are millions of people who are more then able who can help the Muslims including you know 1.2 billion Muslims, along with 22 arab states in the immediate vicinity, but it's out of his capability to help them also, the Christians do not have any allies, the western world is not coming to save them. It's like during the holocaust, millions died, are you going to go grab a gun and try to liberate a death camp or help the lil Jewish girl you found wandering in the street. It's called recognizing your limits and focusing them where they will be of the most help.
To all dairy farmers or those who work in the dairy industry, does a cow need to give birth to provide milk?
"You may have not have had a chance to read my edit on the previous post, but I will mention it again here. If you have the legal right to do something, you don't need to petition a court to carry it out." Once again that's not how it works, seceding is not legal right framed into the constitution, that's why if you reread my post you see my clearly pointing out they would have a very good legal case to argue they can secede from the union. It's not inherent.   "And, second, if the Court miraculously sided with the South, the North was now in a political pickle that would undermine their ability to deny the South's legitimacy." Now you're getting it. The right of secession being fought in the courts would of been a nightmare scenario for the union, Lincoln was extremely lucky the question was settled on the battlefield instead of court. Which brings me back to how heavily the south fucked up by going the war route instead of holding fire.  Nope midwest. In you would be correct if fort sumter was a hostile entity, look at the placement of the fort, being under threat of cannon's would be a reality if a war had already begun, like you stated previously it did not kick off until 61. If fort sumter was a threat to shipping which they were not i could agree but they were not firing upon any ships. All ships coming into port would be commercial vessels or foreign only confederate naval vessels the few that did exist would possibly be faced with fire in this is only later in the war.
That's cute. Jennifer Lawrence, heroic lead role of one of the biggest franchises in cinema to date. Gets paid more then Chris pratt now explain to me why does this exist? because it's about the box office that's all that matters in Hollywood. Point to a single case where a woman makes less then a man in Hollywood? you don't because salaries are not even published unless they choose to release the info. Being a actor is not a set pay scale, theirs no way to determine or make a report on wage gap since they do not get wages god how can people be this stupid.   Furthermore we do not know what she got paid for american hustle, you're referring to "point" she got 7 compared to christian bale's, renners and other's 9 points. This is intellectually dishonest to say she got paid less because she has a pussy in they have a penis. First, Lawrence had a minor, supporting role in American Hustle. This is just a fact. Cooper has the Hangover Series, among other hits, which hold the #1 and 2 spot on the highest grossing comedies of all time. Between them, they probably have over $4 billion in box office hits and are big, international draws. The contract for this film was probably made in 2012 or early 2013, which was just after Renner's The Avengers and during which time Lawrence only had the first Hunger Games under her big box office belt.  A lot of Renner's scenes were cut, including the original final scene.  He was originally a much more central figure, and the only really sympathetic character. His part was as big as Bale's and Cooper's in the shooting script, I believe. None of Lawrence's stuff got cut, I don't think, which is why she feels so big in the movie, but she's definitely more of a supporting roll.  It became clear that the Amy Adams storyline would be the central focus, and that Renner would be more of a supporting role (as he is a real person and a lot of his stuff was expository).  Cooper's role increased as a result of the plot shifting to Adams and Bale more exclusively (he's essential to that part of the story). Then the rest of his scenes with Louis CK had no chance of being cut. I believe most of the original Renner scenes were with Bale (whose part was also slightly smaller than originally intended, though he drives the narrative).  Also, David O. Russell really wants Renner to be seen on the level of Bale and Cooper which is probably why david o russel was pushing to get him a equal 9 points with bale and cooper, and his chops and creds merit that.   Oh 9 out of ten best actors in the last few years were men? SO????! should we start paying actors and actress the same amount because of their genitals, you sound like the people who complained when selma did not get nominated for the academy. Just because you make oscar bait and did not catch fish does not make the entire academy the equivalent to the kkk, adam sandler made 49 million because his movies are extremely profitable and because he owns the production company.  That's how he gets 49 million, think of it like call of duty. Same game every year but it makes a billion easily, why is this? it's utter repetitive crap, but guess what people buy cod and play the crap out of it. Yes they're infinitely better video game franchises but they don't have as much mainstream appeal. Hollywood is the height of this business model, if actor A brings in 700 million just because his name is in the credits and actor b only brings in 500 million and then actor c has 30 years of work, is an Oscar winner and has been nominated 30 times who do you think i will pay more? the guy who is bringing in 700 million.  Hollywood comes down to knowing what you're worth, a great example of this is charlize theron who was livid when she found out she was not making as much as co-star and told the studio she wanted the same, in guess what? they gave it to her. If you're worth 20 million dollar in 9 bloody points then call your agent up and tell them you're not filming a single scene until you get that.  It's not rocket science... oh wait i forgot according to feminist and pao women are inferior hagglers, due to their "delicate" sensibilities so they cannot properly argue for their worth or value to a prospective employer. Damned patriarchy. It's sad that all these female actresses will never be on equal footing with male costars because theirs no such thing as idk agents who negotiate your contract?
The majority of southern people think the civil war was fought over states right and that this is the actual confederate flag not the battle flag. In otherwords people are stupid, it does not matter how you identify with a flag, the flags popularity and resurgence stems from racism and pro-segregation with a origin in the cause of slavery. I don't care if 40 years from now germans will identify the nazi swastika with pride in being german it is still a racist symbol so get over it.  it's not to extremes it's the most logical comparison if any. OMG this is your problem you have the same level of b.s in your ears, you do not seek independence by firing upon a federal fort and seizing it, which if you succeeded would be another countries property. The civil war was not about independence it was about keeping slavery, stop trying to glaze over this with nice words they wanted to keep slaves, the states that succeeded announced this clearly.  That's why the secessionist movement even exist, that's why the flag exist and that's what it comes down to. Both were immoral movements, the only difference is grant being a drunk allowed the south to get federal troops removed when we should of stayed and made sure the next generation grew up not knowing their fathers and grandfathers were wrong and taught this. Instead it's been over a century in we're still dealing with the same old bull because southerners can't admit their ancestors started the bloodiest war in american history to own black people and then have the audacity to tell black people to let go of the "race card" like seriously how hypocritical and ignorant can you be. This comes down to nothing more then the fact like with japan white washing their atrocities you have a generation who either does not know or outright supports these war criminals, the only difference is southerners call this pride. If only we had not allowed history to be whitewashed.
Um did you get this off of russia today?
No that's chainmail not fishnets.
I can see why you chose hawkeye as your flair. When did comic books become the new staging ground for emasculated men to white knight causes on the basis of feminist rhetoric? Jesus being a bitch boy to feminist will never get you laid..... ever... not now, not back in grade school and not in the future.   OP's post was sensible compared to your diatribe.
Then why are you complaining. Exclusives are a reality, it happens on all platforms. The entire concept of this subreddit is about how your platform is better and more exclusionary compared to console peasants just seems kind of hypocritical to be mad about console segregation when this is what the subreddit stand for and that we're better then the console peasants.
Better then yours when you claim something and then post a link that contradicts your own statement. Did you not even read that story? there is no other 68, that's the issue. There are not a hundred rapes reported, you just said in your last comment it was all theoretical. No what you're doing is trying to do is redefine rape, educating kids on rape does not correlate to actual rape because it's not in relation to sex or average population figures. Rape is about dominance and control, not sexual violence.  You can't find any numbers yet you just stated around 88 women went to jail for false accusations of rape. Do you just state things out of the blue?
Oh had no idea bruh, thought you were being a right asshole mate, my bad. Did not know i was asking for that, i didn't want people to make a build for me but this is my first time so i made a post over at buildapcforme tho since it seems simpler. Thanks for that, i thought this subreddit would be able to help guide me so i don't just randomly buy parts and other things. But i clicked on the sidebar and i'm going through it, once i have a better view of what i want to build and parts could i post a thread here with that defined build in get some tips to fine tune it?
In how many guns and drugs do they have exactly?
Explain to me one good thing they have accomplished then in concerns to the freedom of the Palestinian people? in your point makes no since, how are they fighting for my freedom if i am a Palestinian and apart of these people. How are they representing me? any body can say they fight for the people hell china's army is called the People's liberation army does not mean people in tibet feel liberated. Yeah but here's the difference, even  the worst extremist in israel like lets irgun/lehi who's members like begin later became israel's pms.  Begin for instance was an extremist going by a narrative he could be considered a heroic freedom fighter or a terrorist. But his actions deliberately attributed to the modern israeli state, a state in which he as pm ended the between israel,egypt and jordan. A state where now arabs can live in a secular democracy albeit they're still problems but this state does have equality. If hamas is to be called freedom fighters whose freedom are they for?
Also the video has been edited heavily, 20 minute prior call and 15 minute from the warning missile to the actual strike look at the smoke in the window at around the 1:35 mark it suddenly dissapears. The footage is propoganda.
Simply put. Their not claiming your "land" they're claiming the ancestral home of the jewish people. As exemplified by the numerous jewish artifacts,holy sites,cultural sites and historical evidence that points to it being a Jewish state. The country of israel was founded not by religious orthodox jews, ben gurion, theodr herzl and the rest were all atheist/secular jewry. Biblically speaking the most religious jews are anti-israel believing only the messiah can create a jewish statehood, which is why whenever you see an orthodox jew at a pro-palestine rally they're usually the radical guys who don't have a problem chilling next to the former iranian president who host holocaust denial events. They're also the reason why you hear about little girls being spit on and women told to sit on at the back of the bus. They're firmly anti-zionist. Zionism is exclusively about giving the jewish people a homeland to free them from centuries of antisemitism.   Hell golda meir the first female pm of israel had this to say in concerns to moses.  "Let me tell you something that we Israelis have against Moses. He took us 40 years through the desert in order to bring us to the one spot in the Middle East that has no oil"
