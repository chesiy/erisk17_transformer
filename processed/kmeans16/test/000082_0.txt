I'm gonna have to show this to my friend. I just taught her some basics, and this is her favorite color combo (and mine, too).
Ao glad I'm not the only one! It tastes like mud!
Friendsgiving was amazing! I've still got some Dr. Pepper/sriracha ham left, but the curried butternut squash risotto and green beans with almonds didn't last 20 minutes. And per suggestion, I went with a spinach and arugula salad before everything else.  I didn't have time to bake my own bread or make dessert, but it was still appreciated.  EDIT: I did have to cut a few inches off the top of the ham because one of the cats started licking it while I wasn't looking. Assholes.
Mine are technically Katrine and Guillaume (former French major). Kate because everyone I've ever met woth that name is super feisty (my dad only calls my mom that when she's being feisty, haha), and Bill because I hold the belief that all ginger cats should be named after Weasleys, haha.  I couldn't imagine fostering that many! Kate was a foster failure, I only got Bill because she needed a friend.
I'm working on my second ripple Afghan (and my third Afghan ever after making nothing but hats and scarves). Once you get in the zone, it will come together. Get some stitch markers, if you need them, put on a movie (I've been rewatching Matilda and Mulan a lot), or some show you like (all of the Star Treks are on Netflix, hint hint nudge nudge), and work for a couple hours a day. If you work on it a bit a day, it can come together in a couple months.
That's a pretty good idea. I never even thought of using chickpeas because, personally, I have never found a way I enjoy them, no matter how I've tried (yes, including falafels and hummus). I'll look into this, and maybe try them out on the some people who like them before the big day.
Convenience is important. Sometimes you're out running errands or have a short break between classes and find yourself starving, but can't go home for whatever reason.  Slightly different, but there is a food truck here that just makes grilled cheeses. They know the college town market well enough to post up outside three of the biggest student bars Thursday through Saturday nights. I get a plain old grilled cheese with orange cheese like petroleum product and fries every time I go out. Yeah, I could walk 10 minutes home and make an amazing roast beef, swiss, and spinach panini on rye with honey and red pepper flake, but then I'd go to sleep instead of staying out with my friends more.
Haven't had a proper kouign amann since I went to Britanny. From what I remember, they are even more caramely and just melt in your mouth, no chewing required.  I've yet to find a recipe that truly lives up to the ones made by old ladies in the middle of nowhere who have been doing nothing else for 30 years. But these look good, and now I think I may have to redouble my efforts.
That makes sense. When I do go out, I spend most of the time at one that is low key mot of the time, although at night it's so full of rowdy college kids. There's a drink there that is officially called "Adios Mother Fucker," although I just call it "that scary blue thing I will never order." Give me a vodka cranberry if I'm feeling rowdier than usual, or just a nice cider, thank you very much.
Going off the south side comment, 2nd street turns into a highway around the WalMart, and I believe that highway goes to Crane (but don't quote me on that). Once you get past the Kroghetto/hospital area, it's very residential, with fewer students, so if you'd prefer to be away from the craziness, but still close to the bars, I'd suggest looking there. Serendipity, The Root Cellar, The Back Door, and Player's Pub are all 10 or so minutes walking from the hospital, and Brother's, The Vid, and The Bluebird are also fairly close. Sport's is around there, too, but idk if that would be a good fit (I've never been, simply because I've only ever head it touted as "a great place to bang drunk chicks in the bathroom").
Kitty looks just like my big boy Guillaume!
I couldn't put text in on my phone.  I've literally never done anything to my brows. Never plucked, never gotten them shaped, never filled them in--nothing. I know they could be better, although I've gotten compliments on them before  What should I do? I just bought my first pair of tweezers, but I'm scared of over-plucking.  Also excuse the early morning, no makeup face.  EDIT: here's a side view http://www.imgur.com/VaBMLfm.jpeg  EDIT 2: I don't want to go get it done professionally, I don't have anywhere near me besides a threading place that is notorious for making brows way too thin. And I really enjoy doing things myself.
Thinking about getting a second cat, have some questions   I've searched, so I know the basics of bringing a new cat home, but my situation leaves me with some questions.  Katie is a 10-month-old barn cat. She's been with me and strictly indoor since she was 12 weeks old, but she is sassy and spastic as hell. We've had playdates with other people's cats, and she has always terrorized them, even though she's tiny. My best friend's 13 pound Mane Coon hides whenever they've been together.   Is she too much of a terrorist to adapt to another cat?  Also, my apartment only has one inside door, in the bathroom, and my bathroom is tiny. To keep them separate for a bit, would keeping the newbie in the bathroom be ok?  Katie lived with two rabbits for a couple months, and got along great with them, but I'm definitely not getting a rabbit (I lost so many cords in my 2.5 months of living with rabbits).  She is seriously tiny. She's maybe 7 pounds, was the runt of her litter, and hasn't gotten any bigger for a few months.  EDIT: I'd go to shelter and see what's available, but I think getting a fixed male between 8 months and 1.5 years old would be best. I think she'd get along better with a rambunctious friend who's bigger than her.  Tl;dr: I think my cat could use a friend, but she's always terrorizing any other cat she's met. My apartment is small. Could I get another cat and keep him in my bathroom?
Thanks! It wasn't due after break, I just worked a lot on it. It's for an incomplete I got last fall, and I have until the end of the semester to submit it. I'll say that it'll be pretty dense, but if you're willing to proof a comparative analysis of worldwide campaign finance, I would appreciate it!  EDIT: The piece is named Godric, for obvious (to me) reasons. I usually smoke rolled things, but I ran out of papes and this bowl holds about the same amount as the spliffs I roll.
Also if you aren't in one of the ten states with no exceptions. Because fuck Indiana.
I used to not like them because I was bad at them and they seemed tedious. I got better with practice, because I wanted to please my partner. I had an ex to whom I gave at least one blowjob a day for six months. I got pretty damn good at it from that, if I may be so immodest. Now I just love knowing that those sounds and faces he's making are directly caused by me. It's a great feeling.
