Likewise, over last year I put about $800 into the game and sold for about a $15 loss. Oh well, at least that money bought a new 970 and 1440p monitor instead of Internet spaceships
*No chance that's what ya got...*
I hope someone got fired for that blunder

You didn't ask for a date or anything - you're just making lame jokes for what end purpose? You need to be direct with women and stop beating around the bush. They will respect you for that and it will help outside of dating as well (e.g. in the work place).  As for your picture in the OP, I could say maybe get a haircut or something, but looks are nowhere as important to women as personality and self-confidence. But definitely lose the shag - I can see you with short sides and a bit of styling up top.
Couldn't have said it better myself. Well put.
I'd prefer a sequel with a smaller scale story. But I trust BioWare.  I am all for the smaller story; I'd love a BioWare game with a very small cast (10 main/supporting characters) that have very fleshed out personalities and histories. Then you throw those characters into a personal, emotionally realistic and trying story for a great character-driven space "drama."   But with the way DAI went, I am semi-pessimistic we'll get another Baldur's Gate clone (big bad, assemble team, do missions, kill bad).
An MMO should do one of two things - be honest and blatantly copy World of Warcraft, knowing full well it will never succeed World of Warcraft (WoW) - or create a sandbox where the players create the content (EVE Online). SWTOR, BioWare and EA foolishly thought to take on WoW's throne and they couldn't even make it up the first step before crashing and burning. All they made was WoW, with single-player KOTOR stories and some *okay* (IIRC) 16-player raids. They could have easily just created a Destiny-like game, or something akin to Borderlands; a story-driven game with player choice and some co-op.  BioWare could have easily created KOTOR with some multiplayer elements with the budget put into SWTOR. In fact, SWTOR was so bloody expensive [(estimates at $200mil+)](http://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-the-old-republic-cost-200-million-to-develop/1100-6348959/), they could have made a single-player KOTOR so vast, so epic in scope, it could have been their magnum opus. I think it was EA's interference that spurred the creation of SWTOR; they saw how successful Wrath of the Lich King and Burning Crusade were (the current xpacs at the time of development), and said "wow, people love star wars, let's just use WoW's formula and add Star Wars." Where have we heard that before, just in the last year with another popular single-player franchise?  From a game design and innovation perspective, most MMOs today are drastically outdated. Every single one is just copying Everquest's formula, World of Warcraft included. The only exception I can think of that takes full advantage of the massively-multiplayer environment is EVE Online, where by players run the economy and political structures in the game.   We can argue that most games are built off previous games, as nothing is inherently "original." BioWare has essentially been remaking Baldur's Gate for the past 17 years. But that is what they're good at - creating interesting *character-driven, single-player* experiences. Not MMOs. The MMO genre has been stale since 2004 - the year when WoW released and EVE was celebrating a 1-year anniversary. Unless you enjoy WoW, there is literally nothing else to play that is inherently different except EVE Online. Why would you play SWTOR, or EQ2, or ESO, or Age of Conan? They're all World of Warcraft, with some twists here and there, but they all fail to live up to WoW's amount of content, class balance, lore or player base.

Various benchmarks (heaven, valley), this website: http://www.testufo.com/#test=framerates  Far cry 4, dragon age 1/2/3, etc. All look the same 60 or 120 (I lower settings as I see fit to get them to run up to 120).  Strange thing is the testing website gives me 120Hz and games say the same thing. Windows says 120Hz. Nvidia says 120Hz. Even FRAPS and Shadowplay say 61+ FPS yet I cannot see a visual difference for the life of me.
To melt or not to melt 890 Jump...   I have been eyeing the Banu MM and Starfarer for quite a while. I love the dirty, more cyberpunk feel to the ships than the 890 Jump. But the Jump is limited edition.  Do you guys think I should hang onto it? Right now my cart has the Super Hornet Upgrade, UEE Coat and the Aurora LX.
There is no proof he received calls at work. Furthermore, the only thing "doxxed" was his dating profile which NITESMOKE PUT UP HIMSELF.   He acted in a childish, stupid manner, bullied people, and we all know he called people fags on this very sub. Yet here he is as this social justice champion. Funny how he suddenly becomes a White Knight when he's the one being attacked?  He's a compulsive liar, don't listen to anything he says.
Get PayPal to dispute the transaction. If not, call your credit card and issue a chargeback. PayPal will withdraw money from his account, or put it into the negative if he already spent the money. If he wants to use his PayPal account after the chargeback, he will have to put his own money in to cover the negative balance.
I am a Christian and one of the last duties Christ gave was for us to go out into the world, preach the gospel and baptize people in the name of the Son/Father/Holy Ghost.  But the way these street preachers "spread God's Word*" is not the best way to go about doing that imo.  I won't go into it much since this isn't /r/christianity, but basically Christians should follow like Jesus did - he performed miracles, signs and aided people *then* followed up with his message as people inevitably asked questions. Most of the stories or parables in the Gospel are told *after* someone comes up and asks Jesus "Hey, Rabbi, why should I do y or how do I do x?" I never recall Matthew 45:16 "Then the Son of God went out into Los Angeles and held up a sign and preached to all the sinful nerds and they were saved that day."  *Funnily enough, most people think "God's Word" is the Bible. In Islam, God's Word is a physical book (the Quran), while in Christianity, God's Word is Jesus himself. The Bible wasn't even completed and compiled yet when John 1:1 was written...
Didn't you know that in this sub we upvote life-affirming reddit-friendly (i.e. usually liberal) worldviews and downvote anything we disagree with, even if there is scriptural proof to back up said views?
