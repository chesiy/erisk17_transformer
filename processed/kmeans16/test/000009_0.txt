It's pretty good. Maurice Leroux did a few other french short film scores throughout the 1950's and 1960's.
Ace in the Hole was a blind buy for me...loved it!
Game FM!
Alex Cox (Repo Man)
2 words...Samurai Cop.
David Fincher's films hold up extremely well. Fight Club is 16 years old and feels like it was made just recently.
Kirby Bowl 64 looks like Sonic X-treme (both never made..)
Looking for obscure (but cheap) NES titles   I've had my NES for years, but rarely buy any games for it anymore. I've played the classics (super mario trilogy, Castlevania, Bionic Commando, etc) but looking for some good games that are worth picking up that aren't as well known.
Jerry Maguire...actually ANYTHING from Cameron Crowe.
Annie Hall
Hello, Tailor: The costumes of Alien. Part 1: Uniforms and characterization.

How the mighty have fallen...
Safe. It's a bizarre film where Julianne Moore gets "20th Century Disease". Basically it causes her to mysteriously break out in sores and have seizures due to certain chemicals and fumes like car exhaust. Nobody understands why she is having these ailments and the film is full of these sterile, long static shots that make you feel uncomfortable.
For me it's not the movie itself, it's the general atmosphere I can't stand anymore. People playing candy crush the whole film, or on their phones the whole movie, etc...
