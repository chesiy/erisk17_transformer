[Here is a very simple graph on suicides in India.](http://i.imgur.com/FovwdC0.png)        [The largest comprehensive review on the data failed to find sufficient evidence that GMO bt-cotton was a major contributing factor to suicides of Indian farmers.](http://www.ifpri.org/publication/bt-cotton-and-farmer-suicides-india)     We first show that there is no evidence in available data of a resurgence of farmer suicides in India in the last five years. Second, we find that Bt cotton technology has been very effective overall in India. However, the context in which Bt cotton was introduced has generated disappointing results in some particular districts and seasons. Third, our analysis clearly shows that Bt cotton is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for the occurrence of farmer suicides. In contrast, many other factors have likely played a prominent role. Nevertheless, in specific regions and years, where Bt cotton may have indirectly contributed to farmer indebtedness, leading to suicides, its failure was mainly the result of the context or environment in which it was planted.     [Here is the 2011 Version](http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/jds/2011/00000047/00000002/art00007)           [And a more recent report.](http://www.geneticliteracyproject.org/2014/03/05/new-research-paper-gm-cotton-in-india-has-probably-reduced-farmer-suicides-not-caused-them/#.UxqR46hn8Uu)   The analysis reveals considerable variation in trends in suicide rates across the nine cotton-growing states. The data, although not ideal, and the modeling do not, however, support the claim that GM cotton has led to an increase in farmer suicide rates: if anything the reverse is true. The Indian farmer suicide story has become received wisdom for some anti-GM campaigners. In fact, we find that the suicide rate for male Indian farmers is slightly lower than the non-farmer rate. And Indian suicide rates as a whole, although contested, do not appear to be notably high in a world context. The pattern of changes in suicide rates over the last 15 years is consistent with a beneficial effect of Bt cotton for India as a whole albeit perhaps not in every cotton-growing state.        Overall in terms of increase yields and decreased pesticide use Bt-cotton has been a significant plus to farmers in India.
Monsanto has never sued a farmer over accidental cross pollination, this is merely a common myth.     [Also the seed provided to Haiti was conventional non-GMO seed and were provided free to Haiti in response to a recent earthquake.](http://monsantoblog.com/2010/05/20/five-answers-monsanto-haiti/)

When they buy used diamonds they have to fork over a large sum of capital and liability in hoping that they can sell it.     The best way to sell a diamond direct to a consumer where you are hopefully looking at only taking a 25-35% hit on retail.

Again, my issue is with the use of it as a medical drug without the proper testing   studies.     I'm ambivalent to its legalization and support removing it from its current DEA schedule 1 status.
