:(
ah shit,
Hardest challenge ever.   Find a mechanical keyboard for 20.
Will my parts bottleneck?   PSU: Aero Cool Integrator 700W Power Supply 80 Plus CPU: AMD A10 7700K w/APU (Not active) GPU:http://www.cclonline.com/product/126323/11217-04-20G/Graphics-Cards/Sapphire-Radeon-R9-270X-Dual-X-Overclocked-4GB-Graphics-Card-PCI-E-DVI-HDMI-DisplayPort/VGA1941/ 8GB Ram
:( i'm really sad now. I REALLY want to play with my friend. But he does not have the money to buy it. *sigh* If any PCMR member would to buy it for him, i'll be FUCKING GRATEFUL as fuck. I'll give you the $20 in my wallet, just give me your steam name and a game under or $20 and it's yours.

Aww, boohoo drown me in downvotes, I don't care. Just because I don't like a game you do, does not mean you have to downvote. or upvote for that fact. Ah do whatever the fuck you want i'm not your mother.
enjoy that. I will never have that. I'm going to go play minecraft at lowest settings on my 7700k APU... *sigh* PCMR is only an 'American' thing. Everything is cheaper in America. 839.99 is the price of one of those. I have never seen that much money in my life. Maybe i should just stick to consoles. :(
