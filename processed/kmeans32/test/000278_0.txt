Alright, thanks for that little tidbit.
I don't know a specific design off of the top of my head. I was just saying skulls are cliche and overdone.

Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
If you want in you can just say lol
I found a metal body, cocking tube, and everything for only about $250. Not too bad at all.
[More reliable retailer than the one another dude linked.] (http://shop.ehobbyasia.com/tokyo-marui-mk23-socom-fixed-slide-full-set-pistol.html)   I'm 97% sure that they ship to the UK.
For me it's here (imma mud bois), /r/airsoft, /r/anime, and a few others I can't think of lol
:'^(

Uh-whe-what?
Did you FAL in love?   I FAL in love with my FAL.
Fuck bandwagons. This isn't even a full picture of a gun.
Catbrains explained lol
Fuck I knew that, I'm out of it and in school lol. I do have to disagree on the naming thing though. Not really codsoftery at all
I'm probably not even going to get this or consider it, but this is still really awesome
Damn, what's that first mod? It's so sleek.
It's alllllllll goooooood
Oh yeah, of course
Time for Dildie to shitpost about another anime he finished   Put off watching Cowboy Bebop for far too long because so many other shows seemed more appealing. I thought, "Oh old show, so it must be drawn old and gross."   After listening to some of the soundtrack and a friend bugging me to watch it too much, I fired up Deluge and torrented that mother. Two words. Holy shit.  The whole story was amazing, the animation and art style was **leagues** ahead of the time. For 1998 it's a really pretty show. That coupled with the great soundtrack and story bumped it up into my top five.  If you've been putting off watching this show or feel iffy about it, watch it. 9/11 would watch again.
Do you guys ever feel like airsoft you is different than regular you?   This is kind of hard to explain, but when I airsoft I feel like a different person. When I started airsoft obviously [I had really bad gear and bad guns] (http://i.imgur.com/nmtS8ZN.jpg) and I thought, "I'm going to get better and get better gear." Ever since the days of plinking around with friends with our springers and LPEG's between jam sessions I knew airsoft was a different hobby.   When I airsoft I feel stronger, and I feel like buying more gear makes airsoft me stronger. It's weird.
Why is it that this gun is more and more appealing to me every time I look at it?   [This heathen] (http://www.evike.com/products/51540/)  [Also the short one] (http://www.evike.com/products/51534/)
I Just Want More/I Just Want to Go Away   To give a little background, I just turned 17 on the third, don't know if this has anything to do with anything. Some of my Reddit friends may see that I posted this, I don't really care. I want to travel the world and I want more now. I live in a shitty small town of only 1,000 to 1,200 people. At this point in my life my grades are only good enough to get out of highschool. I own a small business doing graphic design and articles, and I wash dishes at a local restaurant and started training to cook, but that won't get me anywhere. I need to take charge but it's so hard. When I graduate I'm either going to be a neet, or working my shitty jobs living in a shitty apartment. Now, I've had plans to take two years of general studies and get some sort of art degree, but I don't think that will get me where I want to be or anything. I just want to help people and see the world, and get away.  Now that that's out of the way. I would follow my uncle's footsteps and join the military, but even then I don't think it'd be worth it. I don't believe in anything that we're fighting for. Would joining the peace corps or whatever work? Should I just pack up and leave when I turn 18 and freelance? I'm at my wits end, but the only thing I really want now is to be away and to help people.
Sudden realization being a huge fan of the anime Steins;Gate   If they ever made a live action movie of the anime Steins;Gate, [Keanu Reeves] (https://hollywoodhatesme.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/keanu-reeves.jpg) would be perfect for the part of the main character [Okabe Rintarou] (http://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/6/122643.jpg) if he slicked back his hair messily.
I'm gonna stir up so much shit with this site   Found it on /r/teenagers, just type in mermur.it and it'll pop up.
In "Academic Intervention" study hall.   Makes you feel like you're fucking autistic and when you have no missing assignments on a Monday you get a treat like a fucking child. There's also this point system she's talking about with coupons like I'm in second grade. The only upside is that I can usually burn through two episodes of an anime and she doesn't notice. Wtf.
Finished PMC Loadout   This is my current set up I'm going to be running for the better part of this summer. I've always loved the look of the average PMC kit so I went in that direction. Please excuse the tactical skinny jeans, I just got off of school and at the time I took these pictures and I was as giddy as a child on Christmas. Don't fret, I use eye-pro, I just left them at a friends house. For the purpose of picture, I thought my casual prescriptions would be fine.   [FUCK WHEN EVER I TRY TO FORMAT PRETTY THE IMAGES ARE TINY SO HAVE AN ALBUM OF THE PICTURES NORMAL] (http://imgur.com/a/ArEwK)   **KIT LIST FROM TOP TO BOTTOM**  **Hat-** Basic tactical cap from Condor  **Patch-** Sassy MilSpec Monkey patch  **Comms-** Just a basic Element headset  **Shemagh-** Basic black and white Condor shemagh  **Jacket-** Just a Condor Softshell Jacket, nothing special  **Patch-** Hazard PVC American Flag Patch  **Chest Rig-** No name brand I added to the cart   **Dump Pouch-** Just a Condor Drop Leg dump pouch  **Knee Pads-** Standard Condor quick release knee pads  **Sling-** GP sling plate, came with a one-point sling  Other than that I'll probably just get some Khaki's or some blue jeans to finish off the kit.   **GUN** It's a bone stock WE Open Bolt M4 I posted a little while back with a previous kit. I run four magazines right now, but plan to get at least six more (I'm very trigger happy.) Otherwise I hope you enjoyed my kit, and I tried to keep everything as detailed and nice as possible.
[Question/Discussion] A lot of questions about the WE Open Bolt M4.   So I have a six hundred dollar budget, and I want to jump into the GBBR world. The WE seems like a really good choice out of thr box, and of course I'd get upgrade parts from RAtech and such. I've been on Arnies Airsoft, Airsoft Society, and a plethora of forums to find reviews. I've also watched every review on YouTube. At this point I'm pretty dead-set on this gun.  Now with six hundred dollars will I have enough for the gun and magazines? If so, how many magazines should I buy? I usually play thirty minutes games at our friends private field, with short breaks for reloading and drinks.  Next quick question, anybody with past experience, what parts should be replaced? Delving into a whole new type of airsoft rifles is pretty confusing. All over I've heard, " RAtech, RAtech, RAtech."  HELP /R/AIRSOFT!
