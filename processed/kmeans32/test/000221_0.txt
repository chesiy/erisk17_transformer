You could tell he did love being a Hawk and playing at the Stadium. (I'm sure he really didn't miss Keenan or the ownership after leaving)  [It's the Chicago Blackhawks, man...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Vfo5xSAnfo)
Yes. My memory failed me.
Let's give the man a chance before we decide he isn't a good fit for this team. I, myself am very excited to see him play on the 4th line. I watched him quite a bit when he was in town with the Wolves. He is speedy, has good hands, and is Shawzian in his ability to get under people's skin.   Many of you were flipping out at the thought of Desjardins replacing Ben Smith, and we all seem to be fine with that now. Garbutt possesses more offensive upside than Desi or Smith.   I predict we'll get about 12-14 goals out of him this season, and while he'll make trips to the penalty box, he and Shaw will be earning us a number of power plays.
So many memories of this guy.  I remember watching him dominate the Wolves in the 2005 Calder Cup finals next to a young Mike Richards   Jeff Carter, and a reprehensible parasite named Jon Sim.   Then, I remember seeing a short blurb in the back of the Sun Times' sports section saying that the Hawks traded Matt Ellison for Patrick Sharp. Exciting news for a Hawks fan who was chomping at the bit to see the next wave of "stars" like Tony Salmelainen and Pavel Vorobiev.   Then, many years later in 2011 or 2012, my future wife and I were walking through her neighborhood of North Center, and spotted a very nice yet old fashioned couch in an alley behind a monstrosity of a new home. We decided to take the couch back to her place. I learned shortly later that Sharp had just moved into that house. Soon, the "alley couch" became the "Patrick Sharp couch."   The rest is a blur right now with the exception of this beauty against the Preds.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8FKbhcILWc index=15 list=PL5Ieao-D3SgZ7pDJ_iIqdYqaQK0P5rFnu
My personal favorite MMP moment was when Bill was screaming at his computer for not loading a news story fast enough, because "he doesn't have that tree that gives you good internet." Then later in the episode he says how he never "lets his computer update, because he wants it to keep running the way it is."
Please tell me that someone other than Nordstrom is stepping up tonight.
Can we please get [this place](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_7I3k5PhW5xc/TNyh0RmPUmI/AAAAAAAAB6s/MfUb4peVoao/s1600/mikitas.jpg) put up for real!
I love how he says "he's got this friend" who always buys into fad diets... then proceeds to do an impersonation of Paul Virzi.   "Dude, I don't even need to eat bread..."
Judging from the graphic on the back "Eurocar: moving your way" is probably the German version of U-Haul. The person driving it probably has zero experience driving trucks.
YES! Sullivan needs to be way higher on this list!  [Legendary moment with Sullivan:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qye101BNhWE)  People seem to forget that he scored two short-handed goals after getting hit with the puck.   Also, I remember him having an epic game on St. Patty's day one night. His trade to Nashville was so infuriating; scores a hat-trick in his first game as a Pred and puts up 10 pts in 3 games.
Thanks, Dr. Oz.
Me too. While on a smaller scale, I was just pissed that this happened right under my nose:  Recently, I ran into the Edgewater Jewel early one morning and had a guy remark to me how cold it was. (He's parked next to me, so I happen to notice that he has the same make and model car; only his looks crappier) I thought it unusual that he needed to walk around my car to get to his, but wasn't suspicious. As I come out of the Jewel, lo and behold, I had a few center caps that just happened to be missing.
This Special and Season 2 of Maron on Christmas Eve! Really hope ol' Freckleface can make an appearance on that show one day. Maron + Burr = Genius.
Well, let's not pretend that Foley and Eddie O are the greatest.   Olczyk: "Here's a tip for all you young hockey players, see how Johnny Toews has his stick on the ice, you have a much higher percentage chance of scoring with your stick ON the ice."   Foley: "And with that goal the Hawks should take some momentum into the TURD period."  Then... 30 seconds of silence
Racconto the worst? I've been eating that stuff for years; the Pagliacci brand isn't bad either. Pick some up at [Serelli's!]( http://serrellisfinerfoods.com/) We used to buy jars of that stuff every Christmas Eve, there's no way that cheap-ass Centrella brand is any better.
A couple of educators looking to increase career potential. Does going back to school make sense?   Hello, career gurus.  I'll try to make this as to-the-point as possible, but I apologize in advance if this turns into the Unabomber Manifesto.  My wife (age 27) and I (age 26) both work for the same company, but at different sites. We are reading specialists who work in the clinical setting; that's about as descriptive as I'm getting about the private company we work for. We both have had previous management roles in the company, but upon relocating to Chicago (my hometown/where my wife has decided that she wants to stay forever) we have limited opportunities for growth within our company, and have since taken pay cuts.  I have a teaching degree, but my only endorsement is in Social Studies; it has been way less fruitful trying to land a classroom position here in Chicago than my search in DC. (I got one on my first interview there). My wife does not have a teaching certificate, but is going to get her Masters' in Special Ed and her IL License. She'll get a job in 2 years, not doubting that. I'm considering doing a 9 month program to get my endorsement to teach Special Ed as well. (We both have a number of years working with this population in the clinical setting).  Here's how the proposed Grad School costs break down: Wife's Masters' Degree: $35k My Endorsement: Probably $12k  I feel like my wife is a bit of a spontaneous person and not a planner like myself. I can't really see these costs making life too much easier at the moment. Especially if we are multiplying our debts 4 or 5 times. I hate to say this to her, but I'm starting to think that when we move out of our nice $1300/mo apartment on the Northside this December that we won't be able to live in a place this nice for the next decade. (We won't be getting rich as teachers, but the expected salary would probably be about $48k with increases; that's about 15-20% more than what we make now)  With this outlook, should I focus on how going back to school may maximize our earning potential, and provide more for our future (a pension plus a 403b plan, rather than the 401k that our employer matches 10%) or is will this make us highly-qualified, yet broke educators?  Any thoughts appreciated.  Thanks!

3 assists in the first 12 minutes. I would say he showed up; going to need Kane to keep razzling and dazzling for the next 170 minutes of the series.
I wouldn't say "spot on". It's more complex than that. He attributed the "white flight" of the 1940s to white people of the Southside feeling disenchanted with living next to black people for the simple reason that they didn't like black people.   However, this perspective doesn't take into account that a lot of white people left the city in 1968. Things were so incredibly screwed-up that Chicago wasn't safe for many white people or black people. Mayor Daley was ordering the police to shoot rioters on site. White police treated blacks brutally. Some blacks treated whites brutally; there were people attacked on the streets because their skin was a certain color. Whites and blacks were both the victims or racism. This was the year most of my family members moved out of the city, including my grandfather who was told not to show up to work without a gun during the riots. He worked in a factory.   These charged-up feelings have persisted for years and carried over to later generations. My dad used to deliver tires on the Southside during the 80s. He was put in a lot of dangerous situations including one where bat and club-wielding guys surrounded his truck in an alley shouting "Get the fuck out of the truck white boy." So, he went to his supervisor (who was black) and told him that he had to send a black guy on that route for his own safety.   So it's easy to say that the "white flight" was based on arbitrary dislike for black people; for some, however, the charged-up emotions that have scarred groups of people for decades are too much to live with day to day. That isn't to say that I don't empathize with those stuck in the impoverished neighborhoods.
[Let Tony Esposito tell you some more about it..](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFhNGyhY4m4)
1991 Chevy [Cavalier RS](http://carphotos.cardomain.com/ride_images/1/3093/1221/7730610002_large.jpg) Owned this car in high school/freshman year of college, and actually drove it from 2005 to 2007; which is shocking, because today it is one of the most egregious vehicles that I have ever seen let alone owned.   The car was sort-of white and featured electric blue and black trim along each bumper and exterior door panel. Giant electric blue and black letters saying "CAVALIER RS" bedecked the driver doors. The Rally Sport edition that also had painted-white metal wheels. Mine was literally falling apart. Any parking lot where I closed my door was sprinkled with rusty dust.   Then, literally everything on the car broke. Someone slammed into the driver's door in high school, so that didn't open. The power locks broke, so I was forced to climb through the trunk should I decide to lock the doors that actually worked. No A/C. No Heat. I came out of class one day to notice that the exhaust system had literally snapped in half, and  I dragged the pipe down the street going a top speed of 30mph with my gas pedal to the floor.   The good news? I sold it for $100 in '07.  TLDR: The 1991 Cavalier RS is an incredibly shitty automobile.
So, this is in Mexico?
It's a fantastic looking car. However, keep looking for someone willing to fall in love with it if you want top dollar. Despite the car being out of production, there seem to be plenty of them in the used market; I don't think you will get a ton of calls if you're pricing it over $20,000.
Just moved here 1 month ago from Chicago. The top two things I miss are:  1. The Blackhawks 2. Being able to order Giardiniera on things  I'm not about to jump on board with the Caps, though. I think we'll be lucky to see 5-6 Hawks games on local tv in DC this year. Such a shame, because this team is going to tear it up this year.
51= Highest point total recorded by the Bears since 1980.
60 Gears?
Piranha plant
Change Portage Park to Polish Park.
AHL during the last lockout was damn good. Guys like Vanek   Cammelleri ,that normally would have made NHL squads, played and tore things up. I remember watching my Wolves get destroyed in the finals by a team that featured Patrick Sharp, Jeff Carter, Mike Richards, Umberger, Nittamayki, and more.
This is staggering stuff: http://www.lrb.co.uk/v25/n22/chalmers-johnson/the-looting-of-asia  How can we diminish the importance the potential lowest point humankind has ever reached. The actions of Japan during the 1930's and 1940's brought about what is perhaps the most widespread suffering the world has known.
It has been a long journey for this guy since playing in Texas trailer-parks.   Now he's playing for ~$10million (American); so much to like about this guy's style of play. He ought to be a great fit.
Wish I had been alive--or they would bring back--the NASL. Hockey fans would love it. MLS just is not that exciting. The NASL was able to lure big names like Pele and superstars from Europe. Plus they had probably the most intense post-regulation elimination shootouts.   Shooter gets 5 seconds to take the ball ~40 yards   crack one on goal. Goalies can charge shooters, sit back, or get caught in no-man's land. Equally intense to the hockey shootout. Check it out: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJEnwi7otu0
