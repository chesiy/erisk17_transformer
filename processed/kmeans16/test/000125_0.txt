"If this doesn't work out for you, you fuck off back to your studio palace and dive back into that cultural genocide you guys are perpetrating. You know, a douche bag is born every minute, that was P.T. Barnum's premise when he invented the circus, and nothing much has changed, and you guys know that if you crank out any toxic piece of crap, people will line up and pay to see it, but long after your gone, I'm gonna be on that stage, earning my living, bearing my soul, wrestling with real complex human emotions!" -Mike Shiner(Edward Norton), Birdman (or the unexpected virtue of ignorance)
I have not.

Yeah probably, I think the month December should just be called "Deck."
You, I like you.
What are some of your guys' favorite Breaking Bad tributes?
They DID mention a new one coming down the line soon enough. It may not make you feel awesome but who cares? For me I'm repping my favorite smite team and youngbae is my favorite Apollo player he got me to play Apollo again after I stopped. So I'm damn well buying the skin and you don't have to I just thing that it's just a nice little change up. You don't HAVE to like it. You also don't HAVE to get the skin.
Where is the duo queuing in the ranked conquests?   League of Legends has it, Dota 2 has it, what about Smite? I know some may think that it could be a disadvantage; but I disagree. I mean, if you and another friend of yours want to join a ranked game and duo or just play together so you don't feel totally alone. Also, everybody else can do it as well. So pretty much everyone can get an advantage if they chose to play with someone. For me, it is more of just a comfort thing of knowing your friend is in the same game with you. Plus, you may work well with your friend if you two were to duo. It just discourages me because about 5 of my close friends all play smite and we constantly do premades, sieges, arenas, and assaults. Occasionally if someone isn't on we will play conquest. What do you guys think?

Okay thank you, man. For being understanding. I'll do it as soon as I can!
