My job isn't necessarily cognitively demanding, but it's more demanding than me sitting my room feeling depressed. So I use it exactly as you described the potential use for tasks. I even go to work like an hour early because when I'm at work I don't have the time to feel depressed, and it's a good distraction from my depression. Granted, the idea breaks down when we have slow night. I work in a restaurant.
Everything.
Looks like I'm fucked then.

Should probably use a throwaway, but who gives a shit? A similar thing happened to me about a month ago, and a few months ago, but with a twist. This beautiful, amazing girl and I went on a few dates. Then she disappeared. I messaged her saying I understood if she didn't want to see me and that I would respect it, but she told me that she had depression and was into in pretty bad and she disappears when this happens to her. Then a couple months later we got together and dated for about a month and a half..then she disappeared. Long story short is that I think I scared her away by trying to see her to comfort her, and because she was my gf and I wanted to see her. Sorry this became a long story but it's making shit worse for me and I ended up venting it here. But to relate it to you, when things got better for this girl I dated she came back to me. Your friend will probably do the same.

Any particular reason you feel this way?
Kyle or Chad. I've never met anyone named Kyle or Chad who wasn't a douchebag
I actually respect Frank a great deal. He does what the fuck he wants and gets what he wants despite all obstacles. This doesn't change the fact that he's an awful human being though. I think that one thing the show does really well is showing that despite him being an awful person we all want to be like Frank, at least a little bit. Everyone wants to be strong willed, intelligent, cunning, clever and ambitious. But everyone also wants to be a good person, unlike Frank. Frank doesn't give a fuck.
I met them all....
This is too accurate..
