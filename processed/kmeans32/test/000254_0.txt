u are not wrong
this is perfect casting!!
wow. typical redditor. this isn't a plea for attention at all, i just didn't like the film. sick of assholes like yourself assuming that just cus im against popular opinion that im automatically wrong. no. i didnt like it. end of story. no plea.
watched It Follows for the first time last night - most overrated movie of 2015 so far imo   1. I thought the soundtrack was cool but very misused. WHY they played it during the silent driving scenes where there's no tension or fear building up i will never know. 2. The main girl was such a dumb character. On the beach, she should have been constantly looking around for "it" rather than just look out to sea, then she gets hit by it. So dumb! 3. There was no tension. 4. It wasnt scary.  5. The ending was dogshit.   anyway, thats just my opinion. (let the hate begin)
agreed
fake
as insignificant as it is, i loved that they kept in the guy saying "fuck you asshole!" i thought they were going to remove it cus of the pg-13 rating but no. when he said it it made me smile :)
i loved Cars!
if the Terminator Genisys trailer didn't have "the spoiler" do you think it could've been better received by some people?   I for one think i'm not alone in saying that if the whole John Connor thing was kept under wraps until the movie, my jaw would've dropped at the reveal. It might have even brought the film up a peg or 2 (i didnt mind the movie anyway im just saying) - thoughts? (no hate)
Chappie for me too, i was like "was that ok or bad?"
clearly they do
TIL that the Batman   Robin sequel was to be called "Batman Triumphant" and director Joel Schumacher wanted Nicolas Cage to play The Scarecrow.   Title pretty much says it all really.   Plus Harley Quinn was going to be in it as The Joker's daughter attempting to kill Batman for revenge of the Joker's death.   I know lots of you guys may already know this but i read it today and found it funny. Thoughts?
