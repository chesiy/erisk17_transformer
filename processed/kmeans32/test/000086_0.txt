Looks like a steak and a side of mashed potatoes.
Late as hell but I truly hated him when he fucked things up with Gus. That was a great opportunity for everyone involved. Why fuck it up?
I discovered this song on my classic country station on Pandora. I can't figure out why, but I really enjoy this song. I only have one question (I'm not a trucker and don't know any so I don't understand the lingo) what's he mean by "bear"? Is he talking about actual bears or is this code for something?
No. But thanks anyway.
I completely forgot about those games.

A million upvotes to this comment. I love that creation of the food gods. The only thing worth getting from KFC.

I work for Dominos as a delivery expert and I'm addicted to two things. Delivering pizza and seeing the reactions on the customer's face when they realize how quick we got the food to them. "You guys are always so quick!" And/or "I was told 25 minutes and it's onlu been 18, wow!" It's so addictive. I love my job.
My problem with Pepsi is that they make mtn dew. That shit tastes horrible.
Disclaimer: this is my opinion which means it does not make me wrong nor does it make me right.  If you fit into one of the following categories, you are a completely helpless dumbass who doesn't deserve a computer:  1. People who can't disassemble and reassemble a computer for maintenance. (Removing dust, diagnosing power issues, etc.) 2. People who can't build their own computer 3. People who think "just turn it off then on again" will actually solve every problem with a computer  Reasoning: There are too many tutorials on YouTube and the rest of the internet for this simple stuff. I've contributed to a handful of these tutorials for those who don't know how to. You are a dumbass if you willingly decide to act as though you can't figure it out. There are text only tutorials, text and picture tutorials, and video tutorials.

Who is a good stand-up comedian?   I'm looking to watch a good stand-up comedian preferably available to watch on Netflix. I love comedy and wish to watch something right now. I like John Pinette, Ralphie May, Fluffy (I can't spell his last name), Katt Williams, Kevin Hart, and others like these. If any of these has a special on Netflix, I've seen it. Any serious suggestions are truly appreciated. I either can't do the serious tag from the app I use or I just don't know how so please keep the answers serious.  Edit: I received a lot more responses than I had expected. Thanks guys. A lot of suggestions were new names to me. I should have thought to mention that I've seen Louis CK, Bill Burr and Jim Gaffigan. Thanks again and keep them coming.
Same here. I never have been comfortable with my wallet anywhere but my front pocket.
I used to ride my bike all the time. I would ride down hill and stop my bike by placing the soles of my shoes flat on the spokes of front tire. Well one time, I did that and flipped forward over my bike. As a natural reaction, I extended my arms forward directly in front of my face. Both shoulders were sprained. That not only hurt but it was also pathetic and embarrassing trying to explain that to the doctor. Edit: words.
If I have something to wake up for then I just don't go back to sleep. It's called being responsible for your obligations. Grow up and learn that life isn't meant to be wasted on sleep. Unless you're younger than 5 years old, you should have enough sense to know you can't just ignore life and go back to sleep. If you can't handle whatever it is you're waking up for, then you don't need/want it bad enough. I work 60+ hours a week and go to school 10 hours a week. I have a house to maintain and food that doesn't cook itself. I get about 4-5 hours of sleep per night sometimes less. I know to have a house to maintain and food to cook, I have to work as much as I do. If I want these things without having to work as much, I have to complete my education to have the higher paying position. If I'm late for work or school, I risk those things. I wake up and stay awake. I'm aware this won't be a popular post and not just for grammatical reasons. I'm simply expressing my thoughts as a response to the original question.  TL;DR: ranting about sleep.
Just don't go with beer cans in a bath. Especially if it's because you can't handle the recent death of someone close to you. Then you'll try and offer one to someone who comes to check on you and you'll have to sip off multiple beers until you find one that isn't just bath water. You might then decide to have your brother fill the toilet with ice and fresh beers.

I wrote a comment about this once before. I don't feel like retrieving it so either you can accept that or go look at my comments.
I love to work. I'd work 24 hours a day if it were humanly possible. I believe everyone should work (getting paid obviously) every spare minute. I had 2 full time jobs (40 hours a week each) and I wasn't getting enough work. People laugh at me and think it's weird but I can't help it.
This is quite the usual occurrence for me. Everyone thinks it's magic. I just tell them it's simple really. When they ask for further details, I give them the details and they roll their eyes and decide they didn't want to know. I might just adopt the "it's magic" line.

When I still lived at home, I was allowed to stay as long as I needed but my parents (dad and step mom) had to be able to view my bank account at any given time. This was not a problem since I don't buy much anyway. My problem was the confusion in this rule. My dad said "You shouldn't just go to work, come home, go to work come home and so on. Anyone who works should reward himself every payday with a little something. Even just a cola on the way home from work." Which I did... then my step mom, within minutes of the purchase, would call my cell phone and bitch me out her : "What did you buy just now?" Me: "I stopped and got a soda for a dollar twenty five" her: " You're supposed to be saving so you can move out!" Me: "I suppose a dollar and a quarter will prevent that huh?" Her: "that's not the point, you need to save everything! You'll never make it on your own if you don't learn to manage your money!" Me: "so a dollar twenty five per week on myself is poor management? Hmm, then with that logic, I'm not as bad as you and dad right? Because a hundred dollars every other week going out to eat has to be worse financially" her: "Don't let it happen again!" Call ends. It was like having two different bosses. Ridiculous bullshit.
Wow I thought my wife was the only one. She gets mad if I don't understand what she's talking about our if I'm confused.
My car battery had completely died and lucky enough for me, I had the cash to buy a new one. My car is a 2004 Chrysler Sebring 4 cylinder, 2.4l. With this particular car, you must get behind the wheel well of the front left (driver's side) tire to get to the battery. I got about half way through and it started pouring down rain. I couldn't leave everything as it was because my tire could get stolen or my newly paid for battery could get stolen. I'd be in some real problems then. Anyway, I couldn't get the tire to line up with the bolts so I could put the lug nuts on. I was getting frustrated. Cars and people passed by without even looking at the situation. Had it not been pouring rain, and about 30 degrees Fahrenheit, I would have been fine, but I was freezing and soaked. This guy finally stopped and told me to jack my car up some more (i thought it was already up as far as possible). After a few minutes of that, he had it all lined up and tightened the lug nuts so I was ready to go. Btw, I normally don't have trouble with this stuff, just cold rain makes it seem more complicated.  Tl;dr: I was putting my tire back on my car in pouring rain while it was 30 degrees out (Fahrenheit) and after an hour someone came and helped.
I hate Dell. Eww. I'd fall off the internet if Dell was my only choice. Also, I second the build your own pc thing. I've always owned personally built PCs

I love them all. Anytime I go, they're having this deal where I think you buy five get one free or something. I usually do this twice and add 4 chocolate chip cookies for 25c each. I end up sick to the stomach pigging out. Worth it! They have this almond crunch one, little bitty almond pieces on a soft chewy cookie... heaven.
Laughed...too...much
I've got a better one than my last. I'd be wearing nothing but a tattoo and a smile. Drive like 50 mph over the limit and when a cop pulls me over, just sit completely still and quiet. When he goes to his car to call for backup just climb to the back seat and lay in the floor incase he comes back and tries to reach in the driver's seat. When backup arrives, if they open the doors to search, just slowly climb out of the vehicle like nothing's going on. FUCK THE POLICE!
