This is devastating. A pure comic genius. So it goes Robin...
So you must have missed the news of him winning a gold glove. Or him being a back-to-back all-star. You're right only news of him being a shithead. And wishing an injury on the guy?? Now who is being a shithead? I get it. You don't like the guy, but that's pretty classless for a guy spouting off about integrity for the game.

Charlie Strong disagrees.
WooHoo for communism.
Jackson is Bucky's closer
Like Ohio State in Columbus?
Maybe pick up something from Milwaukee Brewing Company. Local, very city orientated. Or hit up Great Lakes Distillery for some great local booze that may not be available up in Appleton.
9-7. But let's hope im wrong and we get a few more. SKOL
Hi, I'm an otter, and I'm otterly adorable.
I really think the mandarin is coming back. The fact every "Trevor" scene had him wearing zero rings makes me believe there is more to it. At least I am hoping...
Seriously...Fuck those Teddy Bears.
Chuck needs to warm up.
I just lost the game

Love these guys, seen them in Milwaukee twice.  Great on-stage presence.
To be fair, it says "unlimited drinks", and that can be quite appealing for customers interested in the more expensive specialty drinks.
McCarthy signed with Arizona last week.
http://www.mpp.org/states/wisconsin/  At least there are some movements and glimmers of hope out here in Wisco.  But as long as we have a Red, State Congress it will never happen.
I wish I was as awesome as Kenny...Need to work on my mullet.
burn...
Yeah.  Well did.  That was in 2008.  In Professor Chu's World War I History class.  He was one of the TA's.  I imagine he is no longer there as a TA now...just doin' Jesus' Pen Work.

Hey Reddit, Check out this trailer for the documentary on the 200 mile bike ride some friends and I did to raise money for a school in Cambodia. Siem Reap to Poi Pet and back in 3 days.
Not sure why you were down voted.  I have many friends that are exactly what you described, people that never leave.  I decided, fuck that, saved up my money and moved out of the country.  Its just all about making the decision to actually do it.  Edit: spelling
Was doubtful, then it lined up with the entire "The King is Dead" album by The Decemberists.  Really cool.  Rad find, man.

GARY FUCKING ANDERSON!  I remember being a little kid and this game seriously wrenching my soul out.  Then to again have my dreams pushed to the brink of reality a decade later and again, now as an adult, having my body shut down from the disappointment that is, the Minnesota Vikings.
Where you are from is a major part of what shapes you as person.  I like America man, and I am proud of that.  I am not necessarily proud of some of the decisions our country has made and especially not proud of our healthcare system in particular.  But I know a lot of great people who would bend over backwards for just about anyone.  These aren't the people that everyone hears about, so it is a shame that the gun-toting obnoxious assholes are all people ever do hear about.  I am proud of the people around me that I saw (don't currently live in America -ironic for me to be defending it and then not living there, I know) who are great people and hardworking and are trying to help our country change for the better. I.E. protests around wall street.
Yeah this made me laugh really really hard..."pooped a mudslide" might be one of the funnier things I have read.
That is real awesome.  I discovered long exposure on the beach as well while watching a fire show in Thailand.  Have an upvote, cheers!
