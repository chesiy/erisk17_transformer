I then made the brim with 2 rounds of fpdc/bpdc.
Moogly is my favorite!
You went to Denny's.
My dad and sister both have the "cilantro tatses like soap" gene.
For ones that aren't as super popular, /r/ladybonersgonecuddly, /r/askhistorians, and any of the subreddits for your hobbies, like if you crochet, /r/crochet is awesome
Friendsgiving was amazing! I've still got some Dr. Pepper/sriracha ham left, but the curried butternut squash risotto and green beans with almonds didn't last 20 minutes. And per suggestion, I went with a spinach and arugula salad before everything else.  I didn't have time to bake my own bread or make dessert, but it was still appreciated.  EDIT: I did have to cut a few inches off the top of the ham because one of the cats started licking it while I wasn't looking. Assholes.
Love them all, but so so happy about your comment on Alloy. Reminds me of a terrible pale pink lipstick I vought once that can only be described as "baby prostitute color."
Mine are technically Katrine and Guillaume (former French major). Kate because everyone I've ever met woth that name is super feisty (my dad only calls my mom that when she's being feisty, haha), and Bill because I hold the belief that all ginger cats should be named after Weasleys, haha.  I couldn't imagine fostering that many! Kate was a foster failure, I only got Bill because she needed a friend.
This is exactly why I got cats instead of a dog (although I didn't intend on getting any pets until my former roommate decided to foster a kitten who stole my heart). Even a large single apartment isn't good to the type of dog I'd like, and class means I couldn't take a big Rottie or Newfie or Irish Wolfhound (my favorite) on as many long walks as he'd need. Once I move into a house with a big enough yard, I will get myself a nice big dog.
My tiny runt would disagree. She was only a tiny bit bigger than this at 12 weeks, when I met her.
First off, it's great that you're cooking for your family, and that you enjoy cooking.  Don't get too down because they don't express their feelings on the intricacies of your cooking. Some people can't pick them up, and some people don't even realize what the different flavor combinations are that make something taste good. I cook for my friends fairly often, and, while they say it's good, they don't say "oh, the nutmeg is what makes this curry really good," or "this is perfectly spiced."
Knit/crochet a thon!   Tomorrow night (7pm to 7am) a group will be meeting on campus to make cold weather gear for the children at our local battered women's shelter. A great cause, but I will be the only crochet expert there, in a slew of knitters (not that I have anything against bistitchuals).  I've come up with an easy, 2 hour children's hat pattern, but is there anything else you'd suggest? Wrist warmers come to mind, which I can also teach newbies in two seconds.   I'd especially like something to show how big a child's wrists or neck are. I've got a chart about hats, but I hardly ever see kids, so I dont know how big to make these things.
Going in on it with several other people seems worth it. Personally, I won't do it, just because I remember the horror story that happened after my sister bought one with her boyfriend at the time. It came in about a week before Thanksgiving, when she flew back home. In that time, her freezer died, which meant she came home to two week old beef and its smell permeating a studio apartment.
As I said earlier, it might when they're turned to full blast. But then the cats the curl up next to the radiator. They don't get hot enough to burn immediately of contact, and it's actually one of my favorite things in the winter to lay my pants on top of the radiator while I brush my teeth and stuff, then they're nice and toasty before I have to go face the cold.
That makes sense. When I do go out, I spend most of the time at one that is low key mot of the time, although at night it's so full of rowdy college kids. There's a drink there that is officially called "Adios Mother Fucker," although I just call it "that scary blue thing I will never order." Give me a vodka cranberry if I'm feeling rowdier than usual, or just a nice cider, thank you very much.
I had to restrain myself from going into a whole long thing citing Hobbes and Rousseau on human nature, but I'll summarize with this: humans are always fighting for resources, but form societies so they don't have to.  But I agree, it's safest to assume that everyone you meet is an asshole, and let them show you that they aren't.  Sorry, social contract theory is my shit, and I dork out to it even more when tipsy. Gin makes me a nerd.
Going off the south side comment, 2nd street turns into a highway around the WalMart, and I believe that highway goes to Crane (but don't quote me on that). Once you get past the Kroghetto/hospital area, it's very residential, with fewer students, so if you'd prefer to be away from the craziness, but still close to the bars, I'd suggest looking there. Serendipity, The Root Cellar, The Back Door, and Player's Pub are all 10 or so minutes walking from the hospital, and Brother's, The Vid, and The Bluebird are also fairly close. Sport's is around there, too, but idk if that would be a good fit (I've never been, simply because I've only ever head it touted as "a great place to bang drunk chicks in the bathroom").
I used to be ridiculously allergic (to the point where I'd get hives anywhere a cat would lick me), but I spent a year spending almost every day with a friend who had one, and now I only get a reaction if I get cat hair directly on my eyes. I live with two, but I know a lot of allergies won't go away so easily (ask me about metal, spermicide, or aerosol products).
Late to the game, but this organization was recommended by a person in the stitch n bitch I'm starting on my campus once classes start. If I weren't trying to cram three and a half afghans by Christmas, I'd join in as well.
Yeah, my family always called them one-eyed egyptians. Not sure where that came from, but that's what we always called them
I think you might have just posted the best thing I will ever read.
I have a friend who takes forever to order and likes to make her own thing. We went to one of the student bars on a busy night one time and she spent 15 minutes going back and forth with things like "I want something chocolatey," "oooh, raspberry or strawberry vodka," "what would go well with that," etc. The bartender had to leave to treat the regulars, and she ended up with something like "two shots of Bailey's, half a shot of raspberry vodka, some chocolate liqueur, and the rest with tonic water." I felt so bad, I just got a rum and coke.  I'm guessing most bartenders would be happy to serve you anything normal, so long as you know what you want before you bother them.
That star trek blanket may be my favorite thing ever.
I'm gonna have to try these. I'm used to spending a lot of time on my baked goods (making croissants from scratch is my happy place).
Yeah, my problem is that she pretty much only chews when I'm not watching, which makes me think that she knows not to do it.   I'm trying the Bite-It for now, but I've got lemon spray too, if I find her chewing. She tried earlier and was then licking her lips to get the taste off, and I'm guessing the tiny bit she might get from that won't be too bad for her.
Thanks! It wasn't due after break, I just worked a lot on it. It's for an incomplete I got last fall, and I have until the end of the semester to submit it. I'll say that it'll be pretty dense, but if you're willing to proof a comparative analysis of worldwide campaign finance, I would appreciate it!  EDIT: The piece is named Godric, for obvious (to me) reasons. I usually smoke rolled things, but I ran out of papes and this bowl holds about the same amount as the spliffs I roll.
Shower Gin and Tonic is even more refreshing!
I think they're beautiful, but I just filed mine into a similar shape, but much shorter. I remember I posted them on here and someone told me "black always looks good," I'm guessing because they thought the shape looked bad. I say do whatever you like! I always feel ten times classier with my nails not square.
Holy shit, I know you!

I used to not like them because I was bad at them and they seemed tedious. I got better with practice, because I wanted to please my partner. I had an ex to whom I gave at least one blowjob a day for six months. I got pretty damn good at it from that, if I may be so immodest. Now I just love knowing that those sounds and faces he's making are directly caused by me. It's a great feeling.
