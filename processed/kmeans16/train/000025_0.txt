As the mod of the /r/badlawyer subreddit I can attest to this.  Really it's fraud, perjury, theft, and violence that will get you tossed.  Amazingly though, there is a former major crime prosecutor in Cleveland who while coked up shot his girlfriend at close range; went to prison for 7 years; and, who was reinstated.  Amazingly the same court disbarred a longtime civil attorney who didn't file and didn't pay income taxes (no fraud involved.)   Go figure.
LOL, I'm amused and all you had to do was describe the idea.
I am half-way through this bio-history by Tim Weiner and it is bringing it all back into sharp focus and with almost all of the mysteries surrounding these years--solved.  Riveting is not too strong a word.
At supper an hour ago, I said essentially these words to my wife.  In fact add the fact that I am a white guy born in the deep south, you get no argument from me that this flag is an offense to my black brothers and sisters.  As flawed as I am personally, that flag should no longer be officially in the face of black Americans.
I think it's a mistake to think just because someone makes money they can't also be an idiot or politically and socially unacceptable.  Trump falls into that category in my opinion.  He is beyond the pale.

My dear, /u/catbustime -- I am so proud of you.  You are doing awesome.
My sponsor is a gentleman I met at one of my first meetings and who was familiar to me as an acquaintance from my professional life.  John G is about 10 years older than me, and I see or talk to him on average once a week.  He's like a big brother.  He's more conservative re: AA than I am, but he's also the primary source of the information that makes up [the Baby Steps.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) I too shared the /r/stopdrinking website with him and he really doesn't get it, but toi be fair he really doesn't understand his cell phone, either--although I told him that lots of info that I communicate originated with him.   I get SUPPORT and good information from John G about recovery and someone who will pick up the phone when I call.  I couldn't ask for more.  If I need friendship and running buddies I can find that too, although they don't need to be sponsors.
I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad.  I'm going to keep SOBER in Sunny and Dry (for the moment) Cleveland, all day.

I don't think that's the issue, here.  The issue is the promises confidently made by this Governor who wants to be president and who got his cred by "disciplining public labor unions" as a pro-growth and pro-business political paradigm.  Typically, the rhetoric doesn't match the reality.
Congratulations, my friend on showing us that it can be done.  An invite to join us on /r/dinos will shortly follow in your inbox.
What I'd try to do is remember that alcoholism is a well-recognized medical disease and TRY to treat my in-law with compassion.  More than even that I would remember that as an active alcoholic in the immediate past I personally was no prize to my wife and children.  Out of respect for my immediate family, I would practice love and tolerance of my troubled in-law during his brief stay.    Most importantly for myself, I would continue to make the daily decision not to drink TODAY, doggedly persist, and above all remember that it is One Day at a Time.  Best of luck with this tough situation.
New here? The Baby Steps are a pretty good place to start stopping--now newly revised with a link to the daily check-in.   The [Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) is a post that I published in several versions.  It's made up of information that helped me stop drinking and get sober + ideas suggested from among others, /u/offtherocks.  My pal, /u/Flow_Morpheous_Flow noticed a typo so with the need to make that slight revision I added a link to the daily check-in, too.    So if you're **new here** I hope you will consider making the [Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) and [the Daily Check-in](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/checkin) part of your Stop Drinking routine.
