YSK the FCC will now take your net neutrality complaints   The core net neutrality rules prohibit blocking or throttling of lawful content, or "paid prioritization," in which online content providers pay for faster access to consumers.  The Federal Communications Commission's net neutrality rules took effect today, and you can file complaints against your Internet service provider (or mobile data provider) on the FCC's website @ https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=38824  Via http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/06/the-fcc-will-now-take-your-net-neutrality-complaints/

/u/nuclearqtip breaks it down nicely @ http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3246da/amazon_elastic_file_system/cq7v9bo    All of the others you've listed are either stateless REST services or places that want small pieces of structured data.    EFS is NFSv4 which means:    * Stateful (authenticate once, probably kerberos)  * Mountable AND shareable (EBS can only be mounted in one place, S3 can be shared but not easily mounted)  * Actual directories. No S3 doesn't have actual directories.  * On-the-wire operations (I don't have to download the entire file to start reading it, and I don't have to do anything special on the client side to support this -- it just looks like a normal POSIX file handle)  * Shared unix permission model (S3 doesn't do actual unix permissions. EBS does, but can't be shared).  * Tolerant of network failures (UDP IIRC with plenty of retry logic) So I can actually open a file remotely, seek around all I like, and if there's a network problem it will just wait for the problem to resolve rather than forcing my client to deal with exceptions (configurable, of course).  * Locking! Clients can actually correctly lock files. Let's see S3 do that.  * Better caching than S3 -- clients can actually see what all of the other clients have been doing and make informed choices about whether to use a local cache or refresh the cache from the network.  * Big files without the hassle (no multipart upload / multipart download, 64 bits for file size = potentially huge files)    There's probably more I'm forgetting.    EDIT    Who says you don't have to mess around with mounts? EBS makes you mess around with mounts. Maybe not if you use a pre-made AMI, but if you go right now and add an extra EBS drive to an existing EC2 instance you definitely have to mess around with mounts.

I salute you. I did this for one week in the summer when it was in the 90s and I could not do it again.

Call them and complain.    I just got a promo for 6 months after I complained, my 50mbps down, and 10mbps is now $39.99 for the next 6 months.   My friend tried the same, but they would only do $49.99 since he only has internet and no cable or phone service.
