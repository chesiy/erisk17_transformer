someone already posted this. :P  But it is Diggle.. so a repost wouldn't hurt.
Because he's joking about how similar Green Arrow is to Batman.  andnbsp;  Unfortunately, he doesn't know that they share villains.  * Merlyn (Green Arrow villain) * Deathstroke (Green Arrow/Batman/Teen Titans villain * The Huntress (Anti-hero, not a villain really of Green Arrow, but brought into the story because.... Black Canary, Birds of Prey, etc. * Brother Blood (Not even a Batman villain, Teen Titans villain.) * Brick (Green Arrow Villain) * Cyrus Gold (Solomon Grundy pre-zombie, is a Green Arrow villain post-crisis) * Deadshot (Not specifically a Green Arrow villain, but has faced him in Animated TV Shows, and his daughter lives in Star City) * Ra's Al Ghul (Not specifically a Green Arrow villain, but Merlyn is affiliated with the League of Assassins, so it was fine to introduce him into Arrow... in fact if it wasn't for Merlyn, the League would probably never have been involved with the story, except some snippets of Sara Lance here and there.) * The Clock King (Green Arrow villain.) * Cupid (Green Arrow Villain.) * Brother Eye (More of a JLA villain... which Green Arrow is a part of.) * Count Vertigo (Green Arrow and Batman shared villain.) * Firefly (Batman villain.) * KGBeast (Not a villain.... yet. But a Batman villain.) * Dollmaker (Batman Villain.)  ___  andnbsp;  Consensus: The only true Batman-exclusive villains on Arrow are Firefly, Dollmaker, and Deadshot, we have yet to see Anatoli Knyazev's story, assuming they'll cover the whole Russian Bratva thing in the flashbacks.
* Dye your hair blonde, Katie. * Thea get a golden hood/cape * Please End Olicity * [John Diggle for Guardian](http://i.imgur.com/ZZxEPzm.jpg) * Bring back Walter Steele * MOAR SLADE * Cast some white dude so we can hype over Hal Jordan and then confirm him playing Damian Darhk * Where Art Thou KGBeast * Slade or Sara Lance backstory? * Confirmation on Deadshot being alive or dead. * Oliver/Amanda Waller scenes in flashbacks * Roy Harper Yellow Hat * Moar Meta Humans * Moar city references (e.g. Coast City, Bludhaven etc.) * Chien Na Wei!!!! * Ted Grant return * Ray Palmer funeral scene where he appears and freaks everyone out * More Season 4 Discussions pl0x, I can't lie in bed eating cookies and gain weight forever. * No Constantine? Fine, bring him on Arrow to revive Sara * Don't dwell on the LoA, move on, just some Damien(or Damian idk) Darhk backstory, then move on to H.I.V.E. * Okay Guggenheim, I know you want to add a bunch of LoA shit, so make Merlyn release Slade for good. * Dinah Drake Lance backstory, proof of vigilantism before Oliver and Laurel were born. * or Dinah Drake Lance in a Flash episode if he goes to another universe
I'm hoping that maybe Roy Harper is pulling a Malcolm Merlyn. Maybe sometime in Season 5, the police agree with The Green Arrow and they get the news that Roy Harper faked his death and he's welcomed back to the probably renamed 'Star City' by Ray Palmer.   Also, my thoughts for main villains to prolong the series.  Season 4 - Damien Darhk  Season 5 - More H.I.V.E. stuff/Return of Deadshot  Season 6 - Deathstroke back(will appear in both previous seasons in smaller roles)  Season 7 - Merlyn  Season 8 - Chien Na Wei   andnbsp;  idk just a dream :3
LOL yes xD
I like that theory, this show is about the origins and the journeys of many heroes/villains, (e.g. Green Arrow, Deathstroke, Black Canary, Deadshot, still kind wish they had Sara league of assassins flash backs to show her time away from Starling, but maybe that will be a spin off series.) If Deathstroke got his suit, and Green Arrow got his beard at the end of the 5 years, then I don't see why we can't see [this Deadshot](http://i.imgur.com/wFN7pMK.png) plus it's a metal suit, maybe (just my theory) Ray Palmer invents a fire resistance flak jacket for him, and he joins Team Arrow for a couple episode, but ultimately returns to his villainy.

I remember commented on a Lakers post about Julius Randle. As a Pacers fan, I understand what it feels to have multiple players injured (george, west, hill, watson).  But if you saw how Roy Hibbert played (22pts 8reb 7blk), i can guarantee you, someone will step up, whether it be Ibaka, or like you said Perry Jones, someone will. I'm sorry for your lost, and  I don't really understand how bad it might feel, playing in a strong West Conf. But nevertheless, I wish you guys the best on your season.
If you really knew me, you'd think I look really stupid. I'm actually very shy and only show my wacky, crazy, loopy, Hopsin(Ill Mind 4), energetic side around people i know well, and the internet is my second home sooooo yea
Unfortunately, The Knicks and Kings have a much better chance of getting Rondo, if we trade anyone, we're done. Let's see how Hibbert and West lead the team this year. Maybe Stuckey can put up big numbers, his stats when he got starter minutes were just slightly worse than D-Wade this season. Let's hope Solomon Hill is a decent player. Lastly, let's hope Solomon Hill doesn't become the most improved player and Larry Bird does something stupid like trade PG, like they did with Granger, and let's hope they don't trade Hibbert for Monroe, cuz Monroe is only gonna demand a huge contract or leave in free agency.
it looks like this for me http://prntscr.com/4hld2c

Hi, I don't know if people are still looking at this. But....without further ado..  My name is Tim, I posted gaming videos, sometimes Chatroulette trolling, and occasionally a tutorial.   I do have a capture card for PS3 gaming, but I need to buy HDMI Cables and PS3 HD/AV Component cables  I'm only 15, and I've had a YouTube account since I was 9 lol, but this channel isn't the one from 2007, I made this to start a new chapter in life.  I struggle with depression and anxiety like many teens but I'm also very socially awkward so YouTube is my way to escape from reality, somewhat.  I don't really like posting just gameplay, I like to discuss thing, I'm just not a vLog person so, I commentate over gameplay.  I hope you enjoy my content and subscribe. Remember it's not an obligation, only subscribe if you like it.  www.youtube.com/user/MrEXGamingTV
