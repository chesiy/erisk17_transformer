Look, Reddit has gone to shit these days, and it's because fake mother fuckers like you.  I've been on this 4+ years, and once in awhile there would be a fake pic here and there.  These days, it's everywhere.  Take R/Food for instance.  It's so fake b.c of fuckers like you that it should re named R/Stockphoto.    And get off your fucking soapbox regarding what Reddit should be.  I'm not about to get lectured from some fuckwit.
It also depends on what you're doing before/after games.  Grande Hyatt is nice, but not much going on late late night.  The weekends are even worse.    If you're going strictly for the games, I'd suggest downtown Oakland.  The hotels won't be as nice, but you can get to OCO in 20 min or less.  And these days , the bar and restaurants are solid on Broadway.
I love food, and everything about it, and I'm also a purist, which some could label as snobby.  But if I see a post that is inaccurate, or a stock photo, or people using words for click bait, I'll try and educate without being a dick.  Maybe it's b.c of my Japanese upbringing, who knows.    But I assure you that this sub a few years ago had awesome content, all of it being genuine.  And I felt as though today was finally the day to bring this up as a conversation piece
Top posts that usually make it are:  In and Out  Sushi drizzled with sauces  Charcuturie Plates  Shooter Sandwich
Japanese Grandma in Kimono Pop Lockin
Lois from "Family Guy" performing a Halloween Comedy Show Oct 30 @ Highline Ball Room. Proceeds go to support the National Hemophilia Foundation   I rarely post anything on R/NYC, but I thought this might be worth spreading the news.  If you're free on Wed Oct 30th, come check out a comedy show starring Alex  Borstein of Family Guy.  Should be pretty cool and the cause is to support the National Hemophilia Foundation.  Thanks!  Date:October 30  Time: Doors @ 7, Show @8  Location:  Highline Ball Room  Cost:  50.00
Try mixing this with a splash of sesame oil, bunch of green onions, and soy sauce till paste gets to a sauce consistency.  Great for grilling chicken, lettuce wraps, etc
This is cultural, and perhaps even a difference in physiology.  Being Japanese, it's been in our society for hundreds of years.  Bodies respond differently.  I hear what you're saying, but I didn't even flinch for a second when this was offered.  Perhaps this [article](http://www.facingtherisingsun.com/japan-travel-tips-eating/raw-chicken-sashimi-torisashi-toriwasa) might shed light on this matter.
Whether it's Kaep or Smith who is at the helm   Whoever is under center from here on out, we support Harbs fully.  This past week there's been tons of shit talking between which QB is better.  I'm guilty of this as well.    However if we lose in the playoffs, the last thing I want to see on this message board is another QB debate, or fans questioning Harbs choice.  We ride n die as a team, no throwing anyone under the bus.  It's not about, "Alex wouldn't have made that mistake, or Kaep was too young"  I'm done with this rant, let's go Niners.
Thanks!
You didn't answer the 2nd question.  If the higher ups failed to take any action, and Ramos was still out there doing his thing, what would you do?  How far do you go to see him get reprimanded?  Do you risk your own job?     It's hypothetical, but let's be real.  There's a general code amongst the blue boys.  My point is, there's Ramos everywhere doing illegal shit 24-7.  How much of it is tolerated is a question unanswered, but from an outsider, I wonder who would stand up and intervene.
Marijuana is not a drug. I used to suck dick for coke. Now that's an addiction. You ever suck some dick for marijuana?
Don't worry, don't trip, everything will be alright, Just clear your throat, and take a sip of that Sprite,  I dunno where I'm goin, but this I do know, You got some skills kid, now go and work on that flow
This might not be the best advice, but at one point or another he's gonna have to swing.  Whether or not he wins, isn't the issue, because he'll always look back and know he stood up to something.  Chances are after that encounter, his bully will leave him alone.  And years from now, you guys can all laugh at this

Mixed messages   A few weeks ago I met someone amazing (the white rhino), you know the kind where you can't stop thinking of them, that rare beauty you run into once every few years.   We've hung out a few times, nothing serious, but I've been getting the good vibe overall.  She even informed me things weren't going well with her bf, and sounded as though things were going to end. (I didnt even ask her) Last time she even said, "I probably won't be talking to him"  So last nite I finally summoned up the courage to ask her out. Although it didn't come out the smoothest, I still put it out there.  She responded, "I'm still with him..trying to work things out."  I asked how that was going, and all she said was "it's going"...Of course I tried to play it cool, and told her to let me know if anything changes.   My question fellow Redditors.  I can handle the rejection, but was I missing some huge sign that I wasn't aware of.  Was this a flat out no, or do I still have a shot in the long term?
