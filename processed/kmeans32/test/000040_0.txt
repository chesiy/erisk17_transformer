Yea, I only have like three serious alts. The rest are just for lurking and stuff. Reddit doesnt control me
Well, I guess you have a point.
Nice
[Album]( http://imgur.com/a/5DLCr). It was a 24 mile rim to rim hike last week. The weather was actually really nice when I did it. It was my first time seeing the Grand Canyon and it was amazing.

But dude this guy on chewyChan.org told me stuff and he sounded pretty sure.

Cuz I saw that dick pic you posted and it made me so hard. I just imagined stroking it while my hard cock throbbed under my underwear.  I want to suck you off untill you cum all over my face and then when you do I can bite your dick off and swallow it and feel your hard black cock in my tummy so you will always be a part of me. And then I will stretch out your new hole and stick my dick in it. And I will start fucking you with our bloody lube while you squirm and scream and it will be so hot. And then when I cum I wanna go down on your hole and suck out our bloody cum mixture while it drips down my chin.
Because it is an extension of humans and humans are dicks. But humans are also nice and very sweet and you will find that on reddit as well.
Sleep. It feels so good, bare skin on crisp white sheets is amazing. Right after a shower, crawling into a warm bed is the best.
Ive never done it before in a speedsolving sense. I l've played around with roux before but never really done serious solves. I was dumb and didnt review some stuff before I began the solves or practice or whatever. I ended up figuring out to place DF and DB, then orient and then permute. And I knew the orientation algs from bld and I use [MU] algs for H and Z perms but the second solve I got a U perm.  I completely froze and then messed up. I ended up figuring out to use MU2M'U2 which is a 3-cycle I use in bld, and then just setting up the U perm to be solved with that alg.   Once I figured that out and got the hang of it, the last 3 solves went ok.
Why not? If someone is willing to buy it, you could polish a turd. The commenters are the ones that are buying this polished turd. You are right that it was forced and the analogy to a polished turd is excellent, but just like gold, a worthless rock, it has value because people give it value.   Once the button runs out, I dont think they would put it in the code for, say, "innitiate the launch sequence" or "send this command to that specific server." That would give it away. There is probably something monitoring it or one of the mods will do something once it runs out. To say that "because the code doesnt give it away, then nothing will happen," is a little bit jumpy.   And how is the button not emotional? The factions wouldnt have formed if someone didnt feel anything about it. Yea we cant vent the same amount of steam as running 4 miles during a soccer game would allow us to, but we still get to vent some. The small victory we get from watching the button survive another day is something. The arguments like this are small football games we play with each other.   You keep saying that the button is not as great as life or sports, and I already said the analogies are stretching on my side, sure. Yea the button is not the next great sport we will watch on payperview, but that doesnt mean that the elements are not there. That doesnt mean that the small victory of a small three pointer is meaningless. You called it meaningless and im saying it isnt. Yea there are way better things we could use as stimuli, but there are also worse.   The button isnt the "next best thing," but it is still "a thing."
I remembered it being only 1 so I looked it up. Its dimensions are 24,00040,000 km east-to-west and 12,00014,000 km north-to-south. Earths Diameter is about 12.7k km so I probably remembered that it was 1 in the North to South direction. Two to three can fit overall as you said. Also, if words alone dont make you feel small, check out [this comparison]( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Jupiter%2C_Earth_size_comparison.jpg/1280px-Jupiter%2C_Earth_size_comparison.jpg )  Also kinsmed is right that it is decreasing in size.    At the start of 2004, the Great Red Spot had approximately half the longitudinal extent it had a century ago, when it was 40,000 km in diameter.
