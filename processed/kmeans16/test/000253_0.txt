You gotta swish, all the shit just sticks to your mouth otherwise. That brother is one crazy asshole.
There's no way of knowing whether it will help the worst of your withdrawals, because we don't know how much morphine will be in your tea. It has the potential to get you higher than kratom ever could if it's a good batch, so obviously that would obliterate withdrawals. There's just no way to know without either doing it or doing some fancy pants lab magic and finding out how much morphine is in it. And yeah, definitely a cross tolerance. I mean, maybe if you sip tiny amounts every day, don't even catch any sort of buzz, and just not get sick... I suppose kratom may work again after a while of that. But I don't really know, there's just no telling with PST.
Sick prices bro.   You misspelled "speciosa" up near the top of the page.   You misspelled "difference" in your motto "Smell the difference". I see you "copyrighted" it, you'll probably want to fix that quick cuz a copyright symbol after a blundered phrase looks sort of unprofessional.   Under "The Truth" page, you have "comeback" instead of "come back", the latter being correct the correct version.   You also have "headyherb@outlook.com" as your email, which could very well be your email, I just wanted to let you know just in case it's supposed to say "headyherbs@outlook.com".  I'll keep an eye out for reviews on your shit. Interested to see what's up.
If there's one thing I know about redosing, it's that you don't do it right before a toilet jerk, or you're gonna have a bad time.
From all the bad batches I keep hearing about from here and there, I'm sure as fuck not venturing out and trying a new vendor anytime soon lol. I'm content enough as it is, even if some people say it's mediocre (which I don't think it is), at least I know what I'm getting.
No problem.
Lol that's around my ceiling for the day, divided into three doses. I was being sorta sarcastic, I just thought it's funny Because it's not that much but sounds like a lot because you asked about milligrams instead of grams lol. There's a lot of people that take a lot more than that.
lol. I love using my smartphone on the toilet. I dunno about you, but my pisser works funny on kratom. It's sort of stop and go sometimes, and I love using my smartphone on the toilet so much, that I always piss sitting down too. I end up spending like 10 minutes on the toilet every time I piss, and my bitch always ends up yellin at me. She thinks I jerk it in there. Sometimes I do jerk it, though, if it's been long enough since my last dose. Toilet jerks are one of life's greatest simple pleasures.
She compared it to cheese?
Dude, an activation rig consists of a magnetron daisy-chained inline with a 2 farad capacitor (500 volt of course) and a low-fidelity digitizer. Do you even kratom, bro? I feel so bad for people who ingest dormant kratom... my life hasn't been the same since I built my activation rig.
WHAT
Anal parachute
Fuck yeah
Bali and Maeng Da are really at opposite ends of the effects spectrum. If you liked the Bali then you should be looking into the more sedating strains. I personally combine Bali and Red Vein Sumatran, but I have 100 G's of Maeng Da just sitting here because I tried it and I hated it. Makes me all jittery and fuckin like twitchy and light headed and fucks with my muscles. Not fun.
So I got up today and dropped about 4.5 g of the green bali... 3 hours later I was at lunch with my family and the nausea was still bad enough that I didn't even wanna eat. I remembered you mentioned ginger ale, so I ordered some and bam.. gone instantly. I went to the store and copped some 2 liters and came back here for the second dose of the day with a ginger ale chaser and it's all fuckin good. Thanks a lot man (or woman).
Alright, I'll give it a go. Thanks a lot.
