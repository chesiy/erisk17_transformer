The picture was ok but somewhere between my photos folder and uploading to imgur it just disappeared. I waited awhile for my phone to stop being a brat and reposted. Damn you technology! So mysterious, so powerful..
It does seem particularly specific..
Dude pass the j
The smaller the vagina, the more effective the move.
Polish beet salad; for real this time. (Beets, potatoes, red onions, red beans, kidney beans)
Amazing!
I agree. Names make things funnier. Somehow the more common and normal the name, the funnier something becomes, Richard.
Dscotca, mueca, la bibliothca  Edit: accents?
The face mask is the perfect analogy!
Ahh of course I forgot that part
Seconded! How strange does "African-Canadian" sound? Such silliness...
Do it. It's pretty good. Definitely worth more than a "meh" and in the same vein Captain America as the lead impressed me I kept forgetting it was him, he did really well.
That's why I'm confused tho; maybe he was obnoxious before the video started but from what I saw all the gun dudes were being pretty chill and just marching and trying to avoid fighting with all the people screaming at them, no?  Or maybe it's a time and place situation? This was not the time and place to highlight open-carry issues so maybe that's obnoxious? I feel like calling it racist is a bit of a stretch tho, but maybe I don't know the whole story..  Edit: spellings
you are VERY welcome. i can relate to feeling guilty over just about anything; i dont know why but guilt has always been a huge part of my anxiety issues. its like, i KNOW im trying to do the right thing and be a good person but somehow it often FEELS like im just a douche, if that makes sense? one of the hardest things sometimes is taking care of yourself and being kind to yourself. i think because we worry we are just being selfish or narcissistic ourselves, but not wanting to take on someone elses issues because you know how much it will hurt you actually shows empathy, in my opinion, which is the opposite of narcissism. especially if they only want you to hurt anyway.  its like; if you can pull a drowning person out of the water, you can try to help them and give them mouth to mouth and bring them back to you. but if you cant pull them out, if they are fighting you and dont want your help, you have to recognize that before they drag you under with them.   sorry that got a bit dramatic at the end there but i think its still relevant :/ i think knowing you are doing the right thing and dealing with your own guilt issues is a far more manageable task than dealing with other people abusing and shaming you because of THEIR issues. its not worth it, you do not deserve it, you are better than that and although it may not feel like it, there is NO SHAME in saving your own life (literally or metaphorically) if and when it comes to that.  edit: spellings
like, im not even saying cavier is gross, but talk about overrated; crazy expensive, tiny portions, status symbol (at least the "good stuff") fish eggs... its pretty weird if you think about it for too long..
Caviar - its JUST fish eggs people!
His name is chippy and his favourite food is cherries!
ok thats pretty funny.
can and WILL  keep that in mind folks; no matter how hot you think you are now; wait 20 years and everyone looked ridiculous.  edit: spellings
ohhhhhhhhhh SNAP
dude hates the band.. or maybe his entire life.
The SuckCut: it SUCKS as it CUTS
bummer, dude.
okay yep thats a good call; but in that case i prefer the scrubby things instead of a washcloth, or an exfoliating face/body wash. i feel like a washcloth doesnt scrub hard enough somehow; so apparently for me its either no scrub just soap; or super scrub shiny face styles... i never thought about this before but its strange and true.
this is a tough one: my heart says GO FOR IT but my head says make sure you know what you are doing before you go messing  around in that little kids life; he should be her and your priority when it comes to any kind of life decisions. dont go in and out of his life needlessly, it sounds like he has it rough enough as it is.  other than that it sounds like you could be good for her and it would be worth having this kind of conversation with her if she feels the same way.
pretty sure comment karma is straight garbage; link karma or GTFO
(-_-)
right?   here's an idea; lets give drunk people tiny razor sharp objects and encourage them to throw them around the bar.  great work, everyone!  its actually shocking and/or impressive  how rarely you hear about horrible dartgame blindings or maimings..   edit: words
so but who gets that donut?
0_o
Boobs.
We can't stop here; this is bat country!
