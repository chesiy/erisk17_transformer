[Text] The Starfish or You can make a difference   Once upon a time there was a wise man who used to go to the ocean to do his writing. He had a habit of walking on the beach before he began his work. One day he was walking along the shore. As he looked down the beach, he saw a human figure moving like a dancer. He smiled to himself to think of someone who would dance to the day. So he began to walk faster to catch up.  As he got closer, he saw that it was a young man and the young man wasn't dancing, but instead he was reaching down to the shore, picking up something and very gently throwing it into the ocean.  As he got closer he called out, "Good morning! What are you doing?"  The young man paused, looked up and replied, "Throwing starfish in the ocean."  "I guess I should have asked, why are you throwing starfish in the ocean?"  "The sun is up and the tide is going out. And if I don't throw them in they'll die."  "But, young man, don't you realize that there are miles and miles of beach and starfish all along it. You can't possibly make a difference!"  The young man listened politely. Then bent down, picked up another starfish and threw it into the sea, past the breaking waves and said- "It made a difference for that one."

One factor is that the Senate thought Caesar wanted to be king and all powerful, the evidence for this is that 'He was happy to be treated like a God' and that 'From that time on Rumours spread that he wanted to be king'.  Another reason was because the Senate thought he was too popular, the evidence for this is that 'Caesar was liked by all the other Generals and 'He led the Army on expeditions that no other General would even dare to consider'. Also 'He was their leader, their idol, the one they were aspired to please.' This links to the paragraph above because he was so popular that many people wanted him to be king.  One other factor for his murder is that the Senate were afraid of his military power; the evidence for this is that 'He was undefeated in battle and that he was respected by the other entire Generals'. In addition to this, one of the army's brave men came forward and said 'He was the greatest warrior of all time, why would any soldier wish to have him dead? He was the bravest man I knew and I don't think that there's a braver man all over the world.' This links to the paragraph above because the senate were afraid of him due to the fact that most people loved him.  The most important reason why the Senate murdered Julius Caesar was because Caesar ignored the wishes of the senate; the evidence to this is that 'They had never forgiven him for entering Rome against their wishes'. Also, Caesar ignored their wishes because some senators hated him. Furthermore, a young woman aged 27 stated 'I am so glad that he ignored the senate's wishes for him not entering Rome because if it wasn't for him the army would not have enough courage or hope to go any further. I couldn't thank him enough for being an amazing General and he will be sorely missed over all of Rome.'  Just before Caesar went to the Senate his wife warned him and asked him not to go but he refused not to go, she said this 'You mustn't go! I fear that something bad is going to happen, I sense a death will occur tonight! Please don't go, I'm begging you'.
Welcome anyway!
