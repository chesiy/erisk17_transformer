Me?
I win. Don't have any friends on steam :( or do I lose?
thanks :) I've had no problems with the strix it runs pretty quiet the only thin i can really hear is the fans going on my case currently playing witcher 3 also with GPU usage in the high 90's
i know its not the best battle station out there but its the one i call my own
agree saw this a while ago
i'm always that guy
thanks for the giveaway, hope it goes to someone nice

my current one (for the next 3 weeks) I'm an emergency services officer that works at a mine in Australia (fireman and paramedic pretty much) sounds really exiting its pretty much just sitting in the office (on Reddit) for 12 hours a day 7 days a fortnight waiting for someone to mess up and either A: get badly injured or B:set the place on fire...
I wont be upset if it's not me. but I would be very happy if it was me. I've just gotten into the Witcher games and would love to have Witcher 3. even if I'm not chosen you are a good person for doing a giveaway :) (also I'm Australian so yeah probably wouldn't work even if I was chosen)
Haha it's ok. I know it's going to take a while for me to get there. But one day I will :)
Thanks very much. I will starting looking around :)

What's my job title in your country?   I was looking for jobs today mostly in the US (I'm from Australia) and couldn't seem to find my trade anywhere. I'm a mechanical fitter tradesman and hold a certificate 3 in mechanical engineering (fitter and machinist) and was wondering if there even is such a trade in the US or anywhere else. Thanks in advance if you reply.
Wow seal has really let himself go...
