I get it. Buy up all you can, pushing the price up of what you already have and then dump it before "Bubbles" the invisible elephant in the room comes in and ruins everything. If this hurts low income earners then they should have studied harder or made better decisions in life. I had a work colleague tell me "being homeless is a choice for most of these people". Much like not attending/coping at work because of depression is a "choice". Mental illness is just an excuse lazy people use to drain decent hard working people of their income. #amirite? Besides it's survival of the fittest.
Thanks bud! I'm happy to throw out a few more if people are interested.  One of the biggest smiles I got was from a redditor who framed one of my pics for her bf. Shucks :D

I played Countrstrike on dialup in australia and it didn't lag as much as this game does. Mind you I am playing against a friend who sits in the room next to me :S

I didn't go but I hope it was a matter of "If you just be cool, so will the police"
