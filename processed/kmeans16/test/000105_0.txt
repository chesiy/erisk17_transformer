You could get an engineering degree but that won't necessarily translate to a great aviation job here in the US. You could instead do the following:  1. Work at an aviation related startup - like SpaceX, or Virgin Galactic or GoPro, or a big company doing aviation related projects They all need talented technology professionals and you could be great at those. Check these out: http://tapwage.com/searchresult?SearchForm%5Bwhat%5D=aviation+aerospace+software SearchForm%5Bwhere%5D=  Even google needs talented technology / software professionals on aviation related projects  2. Go to a big aerospace company like Boeing, Lockheed, etc. They all need great software engineers  3. Also get your private pilots license if you can (it's pricey ~$20-25k in the US) but gettable over a few years and really worth it. Maybe you could even get a job building / testing drones  Engineering is an interesting path but it's a bit commitment and it isn't clear that it will necessarily get you a meaningfully better or more directly aviation related role at these companies.
Office Manager Jobs at Large Corporates and Startups (great for entry-level and junior professionals)
They aren't inaccessible. It's just that one their own, they lack popular front-end frameworks to rapid prototype an application that you can use.   I think if you are learning programming for the first time, especially outside of a college environment  - it's really fulfilling when you can build a real live application that solves an itch you have and is fun to use. That can be a huge high that leads you to build on the skill and get better.  It's a little bit like learning a musical instrument for the first time. If you spend the first 6 months just playing scales back and forth, it gets dull and people tend to lose interest, but the minute you learn that first tune, you are hooked. Suddenly you aren't playing an instrument, you are making music that you recognize as music.  The same goes with programming. The sooner you move away from learning coding, and start to build something you can play with, you get hooked.  Python and C++ are fantastic programs. I especially loved C++. Maybe with something like C++, you could learn openGL / Unity / Unreal and make a cool game or something. I used to enjoy using C++ for image processing (but I admit it was because of a class I took and not self driven). Perhaps you are exceptionally curious and driven and use those languages to build out something amazing. With Python - you could even use learn Django and end up making a cool web app.  But if you are starting out coding in your 20s, then start with PHP / Yii and build a simple blog. Then figure out how to integrate it with or extend Wordpress, and add little features and hooks.   If you do that, programming ceases to be a series of obscure incantations that you offer up to a computing black box, and suddenly becomes the lego building blocks to a new and tangible universe.
This reminds me of one of my favorite songs from Flight of the Conchord  - hiphopopotamus vs. rhymenoceros, where Brett says:  "Yes, sometimes my lyrics are sexist But you lovely bitches and hoes should know I'm trying to correct this"  I love that show.

The Paradox of the Neck Tie
I can suggest the following rule-of-thumb: 1. If you have already done more than a 1.5 years in your current job, you should always be looking. Doesn't have to mean sending your resume out to 100s of other companies, but look at the job sites and see what piques your interest. This regular market check makes sure you aren't just staying out of inertia. 2. Before that period - its too early to judge a job or a company (unless its downright nasty)  Rule of thumb 3 (assuming you are competent at your current job and the issues you describe aren't performance related as it sounds like from your post) - push for more responsibility. As in take it on - don't ask. Pioneer a special project that the company needs badly but no one has gotten around to take ownership (large companies have tons of those), try and take the initiative. If you feel like that is getting noticed and appreciated, and as a result you are enjoying the job more - its a good place to be. If you feel like people are resistant, you are getting more questions than support - then its time to leave.  I have absolutely stayed at a company too long. And sometimes the job gets different, but not better but it "feels" like its better. I have found only when I push for more responsibility and try and take charge of my career, I get a sense for the real values / culture of the company and then my decision is clear.

How To Get Into Investment Banking
It will be hard. Unless you are going to get your degree at one of the top colleges like Harvard or Penn, chances are slim, and even then chances are difficult. There are other great jobs to look at. Maybe real estate finance at a local bank / financial institution. Either way - get moving while at college, try and do as many internships as you can over summers and through the school year and network hard. Good luck.  I run a career site - tapwage.com  We list a lot of banking, investing and real estate finance jobs. Check it out and see if those make sense for you
On its own "ethical investing" doesn't outperform other forms of investing, and sometimes underperforms - for good reasons. Its hard enough finding alpha (outsized returns) in a  relatively efficient market place, its really hard to do that with constraints. Moreover, the best portfolio managers are not incentivized to do ethical investing.  I like how the industry has evolved beyond that to "impact investing". This is more than ethical investing. This is looking at specific areas where you know resource allocation has been awry (for political, social and / or cultural reasons) and using investing to correct that imbalance.   A great example is funds that invest in women and / or minority founders. Its well known and well documented that women and minorities struggle to raise money from traditional VCs. But mathematically, there is no reason for this segment of founders to under-perform for any reason. So impact investing in this segment has an arbitrage benefit where you can fund underrepresented founders and avail of overlooked opportunities. As the systemic biases normalize though, the alpha opportunities will reduce. But others might come up. These types of investing have shown the ability to perform and outperform the market. That said, it still depends a lot on the quality of investment manager talent that these funds are able to get.  We wrote a guide to impact investing here: http://tapwage.com/cheatsheets/2015/05/06/guide-to-impact-investing  Also here is a collection of interesting junior jobs in impact investing. These can give you a better sense of what the job is like and what the typical requirements are: http://tapwage.com/channel/initiation-to-impact-investing
There are actually quite a lot of interesting data science and quantitative roles that you can search for across industries but sometimes its not easy to find them since they are called a lot of different things.
