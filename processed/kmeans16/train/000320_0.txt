Here here!  It is insane to do the same thing over and over and expecting different results. When the rhetoric dusts settles down in the years to come, history will show Obama had the right approach and he will be remembered for it. That is unless we elect Scott Walker and he goes to war with Iran on day one of his presidency.  We have been doing this for decades and it had been a total failure. The time has come to put an end to this insanity.

Yea all of that is horseshit.    * Overall health care costs are rising at historically low rates.   * Premiums in the marketplaces aren't rising quickly, and more insurers are jumping in to compete.  * Employer premiums also aren't rising quickly.   * The net effect on the budget has been to reduce the deficit.  * More people have health insurance.  * People who are getting health insurance are almost certainly better off.   http://www.newrepublic.com/article/119623/obamacare-one-year-seven-charts-show-law-working
Well obviously you two are not here to find out the truth. Just here to spread lies.   When I answer your questions you refuse to see anything. Instead you make fun of our bots.   If you have any other serious questions, let me know, although I know your quest is not for the truth because as we have seen here, you that when proof is presented you are wrong, you will not admit it.  Proof has been presented sue had nothing to do with foodpantry shutdown. But you go ahead and make fun of our bots if that makes you happy.
Thank you. Your post is all set. Good luck. :D
Great. I am so glad to hear that. Go ahead and make your post again any time you like. :D
He seemed like a very nice guy and if he did a good job for you, I'm pretty sure he will do the same for me. Can't tell you how much trouble and money you saved me. Now all I have to do is empty my house of everything I own. (haha)  It will be worth it though. Cheers to you my friend. Let me know if you need some help in the future. I am not far away at all. :D
Horseshit!   One of **his** biggest crowds. Not one of **the** biggest crowds. So he filled a high school gymnasium. Hillary had twice that many last week.   Words like massive, astronautical, huge, and others like are being thrown about in extremely  exaggerated and misused. Have fun with your little circle jerk and watch as he fades into obscurity just like Ron Paul when you blathered over him.

Who turned out to be the Loch Ness Monster?   Today I watched the "Succubus" episode for about the tree hundred and fiddy time.  But I noticed something I had never noticed before. Do you know what character in that episode turned out to be the Loch Ness Monster?  --------------  Edit: Eric's optometrist is the Loch Ness Monster. The entire episode they make Chef's dad out as some looney who imagines everyone disguised as the Loch Ness monster asking for tree fiddy. But in the very last scene we find out that he wasn't imagining it. Watch the episode again and you will see. Eric's optometrist is the Loch Ness Monster. Here is the script from the episode. Look at the last line. The optometrist asks Eric for three fifty.  http://www.imsdb.com/transcripts/South-Park-The-Succubus.html

ELECTION WEEK! - Please join us in celebrating and publicizing this crucial event now facing us - All posts this week will be dedicated to election issues and getting out the vote!   The time has come and in this last crucial week /r/democrats will be dedicated solely to election issues and getting out the vote.  The only reason democrats lose in the midterms is because of voter turnout.   **It's time to get off our asses and rally our base to make their voices heard.**  Many important contests are in a virtual tie. We can make a difference if we just get out and vote.  And don't tell me your vote doesn't count. That is the lamest excuse I have ever heard. It counts now more than ever.  * **Effective until November 4th, all posts in /r/democrats must be election and get out the vote related. We can do this. It's time to do your part!**
