Yeah, im just curious as to what the ash is.
Obturarent capita cinere
Stumbled across this thanks to someone on twitter. Looks like some black magic shit. Honestly has no idea. I recently found a youtube channel related to a name that's tied to the website. Their only video can be found [here(WARNING LOUD SOUNDS)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SM90-L2g0tc). Its quite disturbing honestly. I also searched the website to find that same image. It was titled "Help me". In the archive of the website there seems to be a video capture that was deleted. I havent found a way to access it.
oh yeah.  oops.
Anyone notice the eyes moving outside the window while Chica was down the hall?

Well it's not impossible some aren't prerecorded. I'm not positive about fnaf 2  but I think fnaf 1 is the only game that directly states they're pre recorded. And you not replying to them doesn't necessarily mean they're not talking to you live since in fnaf 3 the "Phone Dude" calls obviously aren't prerecorded since springtrap isn't present on night 1 of fnaf3.
ayy lmao
the swipe of 87'
THe eyes sorta disproves this. I thought about this too though.

Ill delete this post, then.
We all know that Golden Freddy Appears in the fnaf3 stage01 minigame since you play as him. The file dump for fnaf3 was recently released with the sound files and textures. While looking through the textures i found this guy (its #290 if you want to look for yourself) So, where do you guys think he is. Its transparent so he probably belongs somewhere unless scott removed him. Anyone seen him yet?
But why would scott eat something that usually taste really bad? Like really,really bad.
