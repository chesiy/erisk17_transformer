Same for me!! I don't have very oily eyelids but this still still smudges onto my lower lash line. I think I'm going to have to try a Majolica Majorca one or the Holika Holika Pole Mascara
**Chunking Express** (1994)- I'm making my way through Asian films this summer and started with Wong Kar Wai. I loved Takeshi Kaneshiro in this and how his character thinks himself as a man but really is just a boy.
I stuck of 3M medical tape down but would recommend masking tape over any other tape, although the 3M one works better than Sellotape.  1. Base coat and a sheer pink to neutralise the 'half-moon' of my nail beds. I would advise against doing this as some of it later stuck to the tape and you'd have to clean this off before sealing with a top coat. I think a base coat will be fine, as the top colour covers most of the half-moon part of your nail (I don't know the technical term, sorry!)  2. Stuck a small piece of tape (about 4mm x 3mm but about 6x5mm for my thumb) down diagonally onto the nail. Make sure to press the tape into the finger to prevent any polish from bleeding.  3. Paint 2 coats of colour over it- I only used 2 bits of tape so peeled them off to do my other 2 fingers and freehanded the 2nd coat. Obviously this isn't necessary if you're using 10 bits of tape which I would advise if you want to cut down time.  Honestly, I'm getting into nail art but I hate waiting for my nails to dry and I'm lazy... so minimal designs are super appealing to me.  EDIT: I painted some nails again and [here] (http://i.imgur.com/wz9aR5a.jpg) is how much tape I used and how I laid it down
I agree with what you're saying on The Secret Life of Walter Mitty too. For me, Drive: story line was poor but man, if you can watch it and completely tune out what they're saying and just listen to the music...  Sometime Wes Anderson's stuff, The Grand Budapest Hotel in particular. I found the story to be the blandest out of his work but the sheer attention to detail is overwhelming. I recently read an article about the set design and how the word 'patisserie' on Mendl's boxes was spelt wrong and Anderson picked up on it and had it corrected in post-production.   Edit: perhaps not *disproportionately* good but John Wick had beautiful visuals and soundtrack too, especially considering the storyline
Really pleased with my second attempt at nail art!
1. I first lightly steam my face with a muslin cloth folded over or microfibre cloth and then squeeze the product out and WIPE OFF. The applicator is absolute shite and if you notice, a lot of the gel ends up behind the main 'platform'.  2. Wash that gunk off yo face.  3. Rinse that gunk off and shake vigorously to get it as dry as possible.  4. Not really, although I haven't seen great results and I feel like a physical exfoliant (am using the Missha D-tox peeling gel atm) works far better.
To be honest, I haven't tried the other formulation so I don't really know, the brightening one is very runny though, the essence drips down my neck so I have to have it on lying down haha. You're probably off buying them on RRS buy the box really, they probably work out to be cheaper like that anyway.  Oh RRS totally mark down the value of things so go wild next time, my $90 order was marked as $7 and Jolse marked a $30 to $7 too! I was really nervous the first time I ordered from them both but was really surprised and ecstatic when they came!
It's cause I'm in the UK and I'm really trying to avoid VAT and 'handling' charges from EMS, as far as I know, most stores apart from RRS and Jolse will use EMS

I haven't eaten red meat for the past 4-5 months but once I got here like 2 days ago, I have been chomping food down like mad.  The lamb was so crisp like lamb chua'er and so tender, well marinated and the soup was very light with a mix of silken and frozen tofu to give it more texture. Could definitely taste all spice, cumin and cinnamon in the lamb. I also spooned some of the stew with my rice to mix and it was really amazing.  Best part is, that dish cost like 40RMB, which is like 4!!
YAAAAASSSS, so excited for this!
My cousin's dog sits very particularly...
Yeah, the BHA sample is from them, I'm not quite sure when I'll be able to use it though.. it seems like such a small amount.  I tried everything last night except the AHA, but I'm going to put them through more use to get a better feel though. I found the CosRX Snail Mucin so weird though, I put one pump onto my palm and used my fingers to spread out on my face and it just had the biggest trail. The texture is a little odd at first but it did moisturise quite nicely overnight.
I agree with doing what makes you feel good too. However, just to let you know you may find that if you're living in a small town (Changping even has some villages) you may receive 'funny looks' when going out just because people aren't used to seeing such behaviour. Even still, if it were me, I would just do whatever hair I liked.  With regards to how people perceive you though, don't get offended if people point out you're foreign or look more foreign: I'm fully Chinese, born and originate from Beijing and I get asked by strangers if I'm mixed race due to my darker skin (compared to other, paler girls in Beijing) and lack of accent.   Last year, I decided to get my hair digitally permed in Beijing during my summer there and it was far cheaper than in London, so if you're looking for a perm or professional dyeing, I suggest you do it in China (I'm assuming your Mandarin is good enough to communicate well with your hairstylist) and like always, bring photos to show your them what you want.
