not sure it's a big issue but I would work on having a solid foundation when unracking the weight. On a squat get into a squat position under the bar and then lift to make sure you are in good position...same with OHP, get into that front rack position like a front squat and then use legs to lift weight out of rack  squat: crank your elbows down a bit, this is going to help you keep your frame upright. on a couple reps(especially the last one) it appeared like the weight got forward of you and you were doing a good morning
here's the link to my p90x results: http://imgur.com/a/6lGX5  I've also done SS, ICF, and then have done crossfit for 2 years. What I've found is that whatever motivates you to get into the gym/workout consistently is what's the "best" and gets you the best results.  If you want to try to do p90x and money is no issue I would HIGHLY suggest doing the p90x/Insanity hyrbid plan to get most results quickly
yup. was priced at $99 a couple weeks ago. They lowered it to [$60](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1631401394) and my work gives us amazon gift cards based off wearing a pedometer and how far we walk :)
yes
Something is off with this Mav's team since the Rondo trade..he played 34 minutes and had no points..I just dont see this mav's team threatening in the playoffs..ALSO learn to inbound the ball
just wondering..have you been to crossfit hampton roads?
thank you!
iirc at the time EG was looking into signing a team but didnt because they were unwilling to drop their dota squad...and since Scoots was 2 or 3rd in charge of EG at the time he is a credible source. I think it was in his real talk with JP..have to see if i can find a time stamp
dont  look at others peoples numbers, the only person you are competing with is yourself. Push yourself while knowing your limits, nail form over big numbers, and most importantly have fun
Trick question right? I always ate all my candy on Halloween
A lot of the Chinese players have been doing this
since its part of a scam/pyramid scheme i stayed far away from it. Also since it doesn't have to be approved by the fda..its basically doesn't have to have any affects. also if you search shakeology scam on google you'll see its literally literred with beachbody coaches with a copy/paste page sayings its not which hides the real research done on it to say it is a scam  tl:dr shakeology is a scam..you are better with a cheaper protien shake

He forgot to attack. He let Hero build up the air attack. He should have backed up and let the infestors regain energy...oh and he also received the InControl Kiss of Death.
I'm only going to comment on the TvP as I don't feel knowledgeable enough in TvT to help you there.  * 1)you placed that second supply depot way way to early. Either the scv building your rax should start it right after the rax OR that scv should build your 2nd CC when you only have one marine and after that you build your 2nd depot. not game ending but less efficient * 2)I personnally feel like your bunker is a little late...if he marches right across the map with a stalker and zealot you're screwed. * 3)THIS IS THE BIGGEST: IF HE DOES NOT HAVE AN EXPANSION BY THE 6:30-7Minute mark(which btw is a great time to scan) YOU HAVE TO BUNKER UP.  The build works assuming your opponent is macroing too...but now you have to start learning about what you are scouting and what it means and reacting appropriately. Hope that helps :)
Early Push vs Powerful Push Question(w/ Replays)   Here are two replays of me vs zerg comp(just to show the builds). I \'m trying to decide which one is better. I currently do a late push with +1/+1 but that can mean i get shutdown by fungals. The earlier push would hit before high tier tech but be much weaker imo. Does it being earlier make up for that?  Early push: http://www.gamereplays.org/starcraft2/replays.php?game=33 show=details id=267798  Later Push:http://www.gamereplays.org/starcraft2/replays.php?game=33 show=details id=267799
yeah i can't even connect to the site. so sad :(
i know how to do the maxes...more in regards to the supplemental exercises
all weekend the streams in the live player were freezing/stopping. I tried talking to support and they either told me i was lying or told me to switch browsers and would not help further. I was really pissed as a paying customer. When i went to twitch.tv I had no problems except not being able to watch high quality...but that was better than everything stopping middle game
If you play terran and are diamond level or below this timing attack should be pretty powerful. I can't speak for higher than diamond as i haven't matched up against any masters zergs yet. There is a couple of variations of the build in this replay but this is my standard one. Note that i had horrible macro but it didn't matter.  http://www.gamereplays.org/starcraft2/replays.php?game=33 show=details id=263476  here is another replay where i dont commit to that push as much because i scout early units.  http://www.gamereplays.org/starcraft2/replays.php?game=33 show=details id=263488   I'm also working on a 1 rax expand variation of this build that skips the helions that i'll post here soon  EDIT: the basic idea is map control is gained via aggression
i wall off with the factory/reactor bc that provides a high HP target that a zerg can waste banelings on. Plus it funnels towards one of the two depots. You shouldn't have your expand on the low ground until you have a force of 10 marines at the least(which will be well after both the roach and baneling time) but yes sac the depots. Remember these are respectively ALL INS..if he doesn't beat you there then you pretty much auto win. therefor we want to make it as hard to beat as possible. making him go up the ramp means you can line up the hellions to destroy most the banelings as they come up the ramp EDIT: and if he has roaches keep producing those maruaders and set a couple scvs to auto repair and then lol as you win
[Build Complete] first time builder general use/gaming rig sub $1000   So my laptop started to go on me last week and [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/onylq.jpg) is the pc i built to replace it. This pic is taken pre-cable management. Thanks for all the help from BaPC, especially from Thenecron who reminded me last night that I can indeed plug in my Sata cables into the connectors when i started panicing. I installed all the drivers this morning but haven't gotten to do any performance measures yet.

hmm...honestly it felt like most the weekend. But some times i feel the same way about tastosis or Day9. I think if i had to verbalize it i would say this felt like you casting for Playhem(which i'll mention is awesome).  i just expect a slightly more serious cast out of MLG than i would out of Playhem.  Once again, Just my personal opinion on that one. I really feel the next step for you is getting comfortable in front of that camera so that when you come on stage at a big MLG, you'll fit in.  ALSO, you'd better watch out for Tumba's fiance talking about him like that.
i'm a gold level terran(and i'd like to think my zerg is silver level) and i'd be willing to help.  test_subject4671.465 I'm normally on after 7pm EST
I lost about 2 inches off my waste and 3 off my stomach. Weight stayed the same but I'm fine with that bc i'm gaining muscle.   The 50/25/25 basically states that 50% of your calories that day should come from protein. 25% should come from carbs etc I do this by keeping a log of what i eat at loseit.com and using their report to tab to show the amount I'm bringing in a day. Honestly, because i'm eating so clean...I feel like I'm eating a lot more and am not that hungry. I eat often in small amounts to fight off hunger.  my menu for a week is something like this:  Breakfast for week: nonfat Yogurt + protein bar OR oatmeal with banana  Lunch for week: salad with turkey/ham( i keep a supply of spinach leafs, tomatoes, carrots, and turkey/ham from the deli in my work fridge) with some super low fat dressing(i use a honey mustard dressing i found at my local walmart)  DINNER for the week:  Sunday: Cook a whole bunch of chicken breast(5). Eat one with some brocolli. Store rest in fridge. Monday: Take one chicken breast(precooked) and make a chicken chili with navy beans and garbanzo beans(this should leave a bunch of leftovers that you can eat on days you don't feel like cooking. Tuesday: One Chicken breast and saute with one bell pepper(like fajitas!) Sprinkle low fat cheese on top and serve with vegi of choice. Weds: Take one chicken breast, shred and mix with 1/4 cup bbq sauce(low sugar!). sprinkle with a little cheese. Place on top of wheat english muffins and bake for 10 minutes to make mini-chicken pizza's(2-3 english muffins cut in half should be fine) Thursday:Remember that chicken chili? leftover time Friday:cut remaining chicken breast in half. shred and serve on top of salad. Saturday: Finish chicken chili at lunch. Other half chicken used in dinner of choice  combine this with a post workout proteinshake/recovery drink and you should be hitting 1900 calories per day and keeping pretty close to the 50% p, 25% c, 25%f suggested by P90x  If i get a hunger urge I eat about 10 almonds and drink some water and that seems to work for me
Week 3 Day 6. No weight loss but a change in muscle/fat composition of my body. I went from having no upper body strength(not being able to do a negative pullup) to better upper body strength(I did 36 negatives last night during the course of legs/back.  I've always been told it takes 21 days to make a habit so i guess the people who drop off after week 2 lack motivation/personal drive(I know i did when i tried before!)
TwitchTV   Is anyone else having problem with ads freezing screens. Specifically there is a Nikon ad that never seems to close. I keep having to refresh the stream until i get a different ad
where can i load replays?
WTF Nasl?   Their event went live over an hour ago to air the playoffs and all its been is watching Orb and Gretorp get set up and scrolling graphics. Incredibly unprofessional. You don't see other sports delaying their broadcasts by an hour without some explanation. Heck we don't even see other broadcasters do this. Ridiculous!
painuser was suppose to arrive at the airport a hour ago to be picked up by sir scoots...and no one has been able to get in contact with him. this all via dj wheat twitter. Just trying to get the word out there http://twitter.com/#!/djWHEAT/status/130110499521167361
