Tomato, tomato.
Honestly, similar to my [Glass Skull](http://i.imgur.com/nrWSQvi.jpg) project, I hadn't put much thought into the plants themselves. These are my first two terrariums and I'm just seeing how the containers handle themselves (how much water to use, what soil/rock combination to use). I'm almost ashamed to say that these are carnation seeds, but I'll probably change it to something more suitable  once these guys run their course. Its a simple set up with larger stones blocking the gumball shoot, bonsai pebbles at the base and plain potting mix for the seeds. It's all trial and error.
Noice.
You're right. It is the worst type of post because it turned into a circlejerk of sorts. It was initially in defense of AskMyFavouriteColor's comment. Walk down the street and ask the first ten strangers you meet what a Cerberus is and you'll get a blank stare from at least 9. I can guarantee that the majority of people on this thread that recognise a Cerberus, recognise it from Harry Potter - one of the most widely read pieces of fiction of the last two decades. A smaller percentage will have already of known it from ancient mythology.  So it shouldn't be accepted that everyone should know.  I started editing because of something I remember reading on Reddit recently. That was there are some things that you can't criticize on Reddit and Harry Potter is one of them. I was merely curious and wanted to put it to the test.
So. Good.
I can't believe I didn't see this in r/gifs already, otherwise I would have cross-posted it.
She hit the mat fairly square on, her subsequent injuries may have earned her the evil villain moniker of "One-Face".

I may as well be the one to point it out. *you're.
Thanks!
Are motherfuckers.
It's a fair comment. Personally, I would've preferred to post it in /r/YTF. If there was a r/YTF.
Firstly, [I think it was commissioned for the movie.](http://www.juxtapoz.com/Current/aaron-horkey-qthe-lord-of-the-rings-the-return-of-the-kingq-poster-for-mondo) Secondly, I don't subscribe to r/lotr, so I'm sorry that I didn't see if it was posted there already.
To an extent I agree, where it could've done without the words altogether.
Upvote for earballs. Though I thought I was the one who invented that word. Sooo bittersweet.
