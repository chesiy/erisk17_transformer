At first I took offense for your comment, but in reality I shouldn't. You are absolutely correct that it is my fault for not taking the time to learn to read a book right. Upon further research, it isn't just me. The screw tape letters is just a hard book to comprehend, and that is the case with a lot of college freshman (based on amazon book reviews). I'm not trying to stray off from the fact that you are correct about my laziness, but upon further inspection of your profile comments, you are just a redditor that takes satisfaction in humiliating others. Every other comment on your profile is mean and negative.    Edit: Also, I made it pretty clear that it was a bad decision of mine to do what I did. I didn't ask for you to reiterate it. I asked if there were discussion groups for particular books where people like me can ask questions.
Oh my god, that is amazing.

HERE IN MY GARAGE, MY NEW LAMBORGHINI. Damn, I'm tired of that advertisement.
post here if it gets sold, i am interested.
What the fuck, somebody got that for $110k? That is an amazing looking house for that price point.
My god
Reddit users jump all over things like this, but in actuality comcast has all the power to fine this person. He most likely moved while he was in contract for tv and internet and they served him the fee to finish out his contract.
There is on gas station that has it for $3.17 here in South Carolina. I live in North Carolina, but i am so close to the border (gastonia) that its cheaper to just drive to South Carolina to fill up.
Exactly, you hit the nail on the head. I have built "gaming" computers, but when I tried my first macbook pro with retina display, the OS just sold me. That influenced me to build my hackintosh, and it was the best decision i ever made.
Legion Commander! Nice loops, do you use cinema 4d to do this? Doesn't that require some pretty powerful hardware?
Am I the only one that thinks this looks like a cold/boring place to live? Love the car though.

Funny how this guy is trying to scam walmart. iPad mini ( non-retina edition) retails for 299.99. This guy has an iPad mini retina box, but iPad mini with the retina displays retail for 399.99. If you look at the front of the box, if the iPad mini has iOS 7 icons it is a retina version. If it has iOS 6 icons, it is the regular iPad mini. What a low down scum.

There is actually a way. It is very simple now because apple removed DRM from all of their songs about 2 years ago. All you have to do now is plug in your android to the computer, find where your itunes songs are stored on your computer (if they arent downloaded, download them first) and just click and drag to the music file of your android device. Album art and metadata comes with each file as well.

That FPS Master controller, it actually seems like it would help.

Mobile versions of any site are annoying. Use the full desktop version.
Pickles are cucumbers. I found this out 2 years ago.
What is your budget? The best value for a gpu right now is the gtx 760 for the 200-300 dollar price range(if you SLI 2 of them together, it is a great deal more powerful than the 780.). If you want something sub 100 dollar range, get the 7770 ghz edition. The ghz edition ironically goes for less most of the time than the regular 7770. If you aren't looking for cuda cores for programs that will utilize them (adobe after effects, photoshop, fireworks, etc.) or are wanting to sli 2 or more gpus together then go amd. The 7770ghz pulls about 60 fps on high on battlefield 3 with buffs like anti-aliasing turned down. Hope i helped you out.
As an AT T customer, i get a constant 20mbps down speed on my uverse line. Also with wireless, i enjoy having the ability to use data while talking on the phone simultaneously. Something other carriers can not provide. (try to call somebody and then go to google if you are on verizon and make sure your wifi is off).  I live almost right under an at t tower and get 35-40mbps lte data :).

Wait for the drop.
I hope I can one day play guitar with this god.
