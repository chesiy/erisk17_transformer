If you could wait a month in advance, then Synchron Extreme structure deck might gain some traction in the meta. We don't know the ban list either, so we don't know what archetypes will get hit or gain power.
Clinton only needs to worry about the moderates dividing up her primary votes. (Webb, Chafee, and maybe Biden). She also needs more progressives in the race to divide up the progressive vote from Sanders. The best outcome for Democrats is to find a candidate neither Clinton nor Sanders, so Republicans need to think of a new strategy in the general election, but not too leftwing for Republicans to play "moderate". Of course, Clinton is still a viable candidate. Don't get me wrong.
I am not sure, if you can tell, who actually needs it the most economically, since anybody can respond saying that they need it and write up life experiences. Either way, it is your call on the pick. haha  I could talk my about my interest for it and write an essay long reasons of why I would deserve it for reasons a,b,c,d, etc. But I want to say that I am a normal yugioh player. I do have cards, of course who wouldn't with all those commons/rares/and the occasional super from the packs. I have a roid deck from when I was younger, cyber, and batteryman deck, so it is not really "meta" per say nor beginner "starter" deck. This is my first 6 ish months of attending locals and I would say that it is a great way to meet new people, have a good time, trade with others, and duel others for enjoyment. It is a great experience, since I couldn't really play casually yugioh with old long time friends, who got away from yugioh with their own niche/interests, etc.  Anyways, you are a great person, who is willing to help other members of the yugioh community. Thanks for your support! (Flattering the person lol)

Free-Trade is always good for America says most intelligent economists. Even if 5 chapters is  about trade, Lower Prices for Consumer means that overall welfare has increased. Trade is done in a comparative advantage way, which will boost more GDP. Do people really want tariffs everywhere?  Outsourcing and Automation is good for society, so we can focus on other industries.
Nelson Rockefeller (the moderate Rockefeller Republicans were booed by the Goldwater Conservatives in the 1964 GOP National Convention), Dwight Eisenhower (desegregated the Southern Schools from Conservative Dixicrats + continued the New Deal + warned about the military industrial complex), Richard Nixon (who enacted the EPA and basically was Keynesian in economics), Teddy Roosevelt (one of the leaders of the progressive movement), and Abraham Lincoln (freed the slaves and opposed the States Rights Movement + Supported the idea of the federal government assistance in building railroads) would be shocked at how conservative and southern/rural the Republican Party currently is.   Also, Bob Dole stated, "I thought I was a conservative, but weve got some in Congress now who are so far right theyre about to fall out of the Capitol."  http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/04/23/bob-dole-says-the-republican-party-is-way-more-conservative-than-it-was-even-20-years-ago-hes-right/
Driving in the United States has a very inelastic demand, so when prices increase by a certain %, the reduction in demand % falls less relative to the price % increase because most Americans live in areas without good public transit nor have jobs within walking distance. Hence, why people are so concerned when prices increase because it affects them a lot and can't change it. Some might get discouraged to drive as result of the gas prices increase. Those people will take public transit, which in turn increases ridership revenues via fares. Fare Increases in the MBTA to pay for the system itself would discourage and reduce ridership because city people can take taxis, walk to their jobs, carpool, buy a care, take UBER, etc. Most economists agree that raising the gas tax can be a very efficient policy.    In Europe or other developed countries, Gas Prices are currently in many places 50% more or even double than our gas prices via very high gas taxes. Their roads and mass transit are better than ours.
omg... I go to Pandemonium was well. The one you are talking about is in Boston, right?
It isn't Post-Hoc Fallacy. This logic would also apply to debunk any Tax Cuts boosting jobs, Reagan's deflation/taxcuts boosting the economy, Republicans claiming Bush's economic growth is better than Clinton's because he got us out of the Tech-Bubble, Stimulus creating jobs, any government cuts/spending creating jobs, etc.  Anything in the Marco-Level economics can happen, so justifying Post-Hoc is really missing the whole point of economics. It is all about correlation and sometimes causation, but it also up for the intrepretation of stats.

A better solution is getting rid of the 2 party system, not proportional and sometimes anti-majority electoral college, gerrymandered house districts, and corrupt Senate. We need more parties and more proportion when we are voting. We are always one party away from a one party nation. In fact, many states are already almost one party controlled.
I just transfered one player because 1st days are always unexpected. Eric Hurtado for Jose Villareal with some spare millions.  I just hope the ones that I got before Week 1 actually perform in Week 2. Otherwise, I will have 3 transfers to build up.
roids!
I think that the people, who left Yugioh because of Pendulum Summoning, should just watch the anime. It is literally very dramatic and can easily top as one of the best Yugioh Series.   " I love the ever growing game bit many old players just dont want to accept it. " - People said this for Fusion Summoing, Synchro Summoning, and XYZ Summoning.
Get the Box early, if you know that you really want the cards for the archtype. Do note that after supply increases, the prices of single cards will drop until the demand, which is the metagame, favors Nekroz. Then, prices will start to increase faster than supply. If not, the prices will fall to its minimum.
Ya. Though, for American Football, you can place a stadium anywhere and people will still go because it is only a weekly event. Plus, it is very inelastic in demand and supply due to low amount of games for millions of fans with limited seats.
