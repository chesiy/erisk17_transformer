These were some high-end pork   venison sausage dogs that had jalapenos already in the dog.  Maybe some battered fried jalapeno slices for garnish?
You have to introduce some kind of moisture somewhere in the cooking process.  Straight grilling or baking in the oven won't achieve what you're trying for.  You can use water, juice, beer etc.  You really don't want to cook them until they fall off the bone.  Points are taken away in competition for that.  Try to find that sweet spot where they adhere to the bone but easily come off when eaten.  Most people use the 3-2-1 but it's not an exact science.  Happy Ribbin'

To be honest it was okay.  The chorizo Spam was a bit overwhelming.  I'd use it again but diced up and used more as a seasoning.  I think the original, hickory or bacon Spam would work better waffled.
Try this "home" solution:  1/4 cup white vinegar, 1-2 Tsp Dawn detergent, 1/4 cup Arm   Hammer "washing soda"  found in the cleaning isle.  Don't substitute baking soda, not the same thing!, 2 gal hot water.  Mix until bubbly.  A little goes a long way.  Don't use on waxed floors, JS.    Maybe invest in a good steam cleaner and use after mopping.  Steam works great to help to kill bacteria too!
Sidewalk fries?
Ya know!

My mother's divorce from her second husband.  All of a sudden it was Mom, myself and my little brother.  I was 12 and I became  responsible for my 9 year old brother after school.  I also had do start dinner and do the laundry and whatever cleaning needed to be done before my Mom came home or else we were berated or worse, simply ignored.
I was an Admiral's cook at a Flag Mess.  Worked many parties at his quarters.  When the parties started to wind down his wife, who herself held a high level civilian position in DC,  would come back into the kitchen, tell me to grab a "drink" and we would go out back to talk, smoke and commiserate.  She hated most of the O wives.  Most down to earth woman I've ever met.
It's no big secret how to make your own.  Take cubed steak and pound the shit out of it till it looks like it wrestled with a waffle iron and lost.    Season 2 cups of flour with the seasoning of your choice.  I like "Slap Yo Momma".  In a second container mix 1 1/2 cups buttermilk, 2 Tsp baking powder, 1 Tsp baking soda and 1 egg, garlic and hot sauce.  Coat in flour,  then dredge in the buttermilk mixture and place back into the flour.    Very Important...when you coat it the second time make sure you thoroughly pat the flour into the steak until it feels dry.  Place your steaks on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper and dusted with flour.  Refrigerate up to an hour until you're ready to fry em up.  This step is not necessary but I feel it makes a crispier crust and gives you time to clean.  Fry at 325F in 1/2 inch oil about for 6 to 8 minutes on each side.  Use 2 Tbsp of the leftover oil and pan drippings to make a cream gravy.    You've done it all right if you don't need a knife to cut it or teeth to chew it for that matter!
Actually it's being very honest.  If I described guacamole then I'd be dishonest.  Your feedback is nonetheless ignored as being irrelevant.
Love it!  I invented a new sandwich when I was 4.  Bread plus an half inch of butter then stuck mini marshmallows into the butter and top with more bread.  My mother was actually brave enough to take a bite!
This made me smile. Thanks OP!
Their in-house made pickles are also wonderful.  My favorite is the chorizo-infuzed  Caca Oaxaca burger.  Chef Grober really rose to the occasion when he took on the challenge of creating the best burger in Fort Worth 2013 within shouting distance of Fred's, a Fort Worth all-star whole-in-the-wall burger joint since 1978!  Good things to come!
I sent the before and after pictures to my son and even he approved and laughed.  He is a great guy and I am so proud of him.  When YOU survive bootcamp let me know and then I will give your opinion but until then STFU! because you have presented your self as ignorant and stupid.
I want to thank you for pointing out ways that I may have made it it seem that my son wasn't a neckbeard.  He had trouble even growing a mustache!  I'm not putting my son down and he would be the first to confirm that, however you seem to be putting yourself down and that is sad!
.... its gotta be Frito Pie!
Very nice!
We'd call this a Breakfast Chalupa were I'm from in Texas but close enough Amsterdam!  Looks even better than most served here!
Those are some sexy brussels sprouts!  The mound of arugula could use a touch of vinaigrette unless it just there to make you think you're eating somewhat healthy *chuckle*
Well if you consider Fort Worth close.  It's from Salsa Fuego.  Great burgers and Tex Mex that was rated #5 in the state by "Texas Monthly"
I am trying to imagine the Jesus of Nazareth telling a starving person that feeding them wouldn't help others in the long run.    Then again, according to Catholic doctrine, life on this earth is inconsequential and the only import is life after death(oxymoron) and the best way to get a good death/life is to suffer as Jesus did.   So the masses are told to suffer while the priests live this life high on the hog.  Explain again why we, the masses, are skeptical of the motivations of a religious organization that has its own bank, government and voice at the UN that no other religion has?
Glad to hear that he's your ex.  My question to you and one that you should consider very carefully is why you chose to ignore his rude remarks to you and women in general.  Why did you put up with his shit for a fraction of a second?    You stuck up for your friend but not yourself?  Why?  You obviously knew that he was a a misogynist before hand yet stayed with him.  Are the "positive attributes" that good that you would put up with his crap?  Listen, I had a boyfriend that stood to inherit a 20 million dollar fortune which I didn't find out for a long time.  He was a drunk and and even his mother wanted me to marry him but after he tried straggling me in a drunken rage I fought back the way my mother taught me to.  I put my hat on and left.  Nothing is worth losing your own dignity.  You're better off and I hope you find your self-worth!
Really?, I guess the morals of the whole Bible were cherry-picked to death by the founders of the US or at least the Republican party?   You make the declaration that your Christian god has given us absolute moral laws to abide by given your view. You say that this is a nation of freedom of religion as long as all other religions acknowledge that your religion is dominate and others must just suck it up.    As far as I can read, the bible and it's new and old parts are as immoral as any book comes.  If you want to ban an obscene book from the public or school libraries it would be this book although I would never do that because I don't believe in banning books.    I'd like to remind you that other religions say their morals are as right as yours.  You've decided to put your faith in a Christian god.  Good luck with that!
Indulge me to allow the rephrasing of your statement:   "The argument is that men and women differ and are not the same. You guys like to foment the idea that that is not true - that men and women are the same, have same capabilities, same responses, same reactions, and you are simply incorrect."  The argument is that blacks and whites differ and are not the same. You guys like to (sic)foment the idea that that is not true - that blacks and whites are the same, have same capabilities, same responses, same reactions, and you are simply incorrect.  Sounds a lot like an argument for the Jim Crow, separate but equal laws doesn't it?   Racism and sexism are both based on fear and the idea of superiority, dominance and submission.  The fact is the bible, from the beginning to the end, stresses the superiority of men over women. Whether one can prove Paul promoted this or not is irrelevant since the rest of the "good book" is quite clear.
Heh, my mom was talking about this and I can't help but chime in on the subject (I am her son).  Honestly, I really have no opinion on the subject, as I have never had a partner say "Eeew, I don't like you being cut, so we just aren't going to have sex." or vice versa.  I am not any happier or in any way saddened by being cut.  Hey, at the very bottom line, I'm a little grateful for being able to be lazy with hygiene (although I'm not) and get away with it.  Also: As I know no different, I can't say for sure that I'm as sexually "effective" as I would otherwise be, but I'm not impotent, and that's the (relatively, because I don't plan on having any kids any time soon) important part.  Oh, and I know a few people that are Jewish, and it's more about honoring Abraham than appeasing any kind of god.
Really dude, What kind of outward sign do you need to have your arbitrary pain taken seriously?   After being given Motrin and sent back to the field when I couldn't stand up-right I ended up at the local civilian hospital and after they took the time to look for a cause, found I was suffering from diverticulitis (not rare) and given morphine for pain.  I hope you're not anywhere in the medical field especially the military.
I'm guessing you affirmed and dropped the last part and only had to do this once. What kind of demerits did they give you if any?
I visited the Assembly of God, otherwise known as Holy-Rollers, when I was 12. I grew up Episcopalian so the speaking in tongues and flailing around on the floor was a shock to say the least.   To call a family out like that on Easter seems almost medieval if not mean spirited!
Is there no free will in heaven? Sorry, that's a question for another time. If I understand you correctly, evil is necessary for free will. Free will is necessary for salvation. So, it follows that salvation in this world is dependent upon the existence of good and evil as both are necessary for free will. "Ultimately good" was a poor choice of expression. I meant that both equally are required. Since God created both equally then does evil supply a purpose in this world?
