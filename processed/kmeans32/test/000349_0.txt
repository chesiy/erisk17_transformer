He loves you too, DrowningKittens.
Mush.
Hey, my friend wrote an article on this site.

Thanks man

Not at all. You're just buying product in bulk for personal use. You like to have variety.   "A new day, a new bong," as my Grandfather would say.
Damn man, that has to fucking suck. I'm sorry.
Who wasn't?
OP said Plato's Closet

Ah, a classic
This fit is the best one I've seen here. I think I'm a bit biased though because I'm into photography and this is also the best taken photo I've seen so far lol.  Good shit man
The language be that Chanish
Wear what you think looks good dude.  Something I suggest is to buy a shoe, and let it sit in the open. Look at it for a while. Try it on, walk around the house with it, etc.  If you start to like it, then keep 'em. Money well spent. If *not*, then return them. It's that simple.
I've been looking in to these recently. How do they fit?
What pairs do you have?
oooohhh, the way you worded it made it seem like "My Yeezys, or my Bred AF1s."  Like you were talking about Yeezys.
You could buy a Size 9 in the shoe and maybe add an insole or two in the left shoe to make it fit a bit smaller? Idk, might work, might not.
This should be a Cards Against Humanity card
*upvotes furiously*
Yeah I saw that too, interesting. I wonder if that's going on Chance's Solo project.
Thank you so much for having Greats on here! I feel as though that as a brand, they don't get enough recognition in the sneaker/streetwear world.
Dooope
It's *Donnie's* shit, btw.
I think Donnie said it in an [interview] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfNVDoX3e1g) on some radio show in LA with Chance  Edit: Power 106 is in New York, not LA. I apologize.
God, not dog.
Practice wife?
Can someone please explain this
Considering neither #10Day nor Acid Rap were on vinyl, I would assume that the answer is no (rather sadly, might I add). However, this *is technically* Donnie's project that Chance has a big part in. So, we won't know until it happens.
Justin Bieber NO MORE   I edited the song "Confident" and took out most of the Justin Bieber. Only the bridge + the hook is in there.  The link: http://youtu.be/ElIhcW-kkaY
You can't.
