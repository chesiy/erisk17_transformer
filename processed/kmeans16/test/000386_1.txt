Staaahp I'm blushing. The photographer is actually my friend named Daniel! Every photo I post is basically his! And hey man. We all started somewhere. I started with a beat up 1995 v6, and I loved it. It just takes a little time and you'll get the Mustang you want! I'm not even close to where I want to be, I'll probably slowly trade this up to Mach then a Terminator. And man, DSG, it really is one of the best New Edge colors, on any model! Again, thanks man. I means a lot!
[By all means, here are some pictures of my car](http://imgur.com/a/xBliL) I think finding a Saleen is gonna be hard. ;P, You should deff blend the NewEdge colors for the banner.
Believe me, I didn't either! I had to ask around on IG to see where people got them.
Thanks man! I do too. ;)
It's a 2004 DSG Mustang GT, 40th anniversary, Premium, has 24.5k miles, no real problems besides just some cosmetic things, like oxidation in the third brake light and on the driver side headlight, has a scratch behind the tire and a small dent, and has a scuff on the passenger side front bumper that I plan of buffing out this weekend.  Overall I'm in love with it, its my favorite body style, has all the little doodads I wanted, (keyless entry and power windows are a god send).  I can't wait to start making changes to it.

ouch!
I feel you, I don't love it, but it's sort of grown on me since after looking for a car, they're all I can find! I need to deoxy the headlights, touch up some paint, and she'll be a beaut! Thank you for the kind words.
Come on Heer_, you're making me a bit too jealous. :(  Gorgeous like always, but maybe a bath would be in need soon. ;P
C'mon pls.
Yeah, I had no idea it was a big deal until he said that I can't join and that no one will take me for a year. I had to go online and read about it today, which was a surprise. I feel like I can ween off my mood stabilizers/anti-depressants, and I'm scheduling an appointment to see if I can. I was getting ready to hit the gym to so I can pass the physical tests too. Well, Now I have a year to get in better shape (not saying I'm in bad shape, I just don't think I can pass the test) Its one year, school gets out in 6 months, summer is 2 months, so really all I'm missing out on is 4 months. Sure I won't get to go with my friends, but I'll get to go someday.
I'm smiling. Wow. Thats just the cutest thing. :D
Oh my god, if you're still up for it can you do me? If not, that's completely cool!   [This is me](https://scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/1375909_634419609936813_1235110306_n.jpg)
Dude.
Oh.
I feel like people don't understand it's an alpha. I understand that's no excuse, but come on. It's been out for maybe a week and you're all already bitching.
