ISIS Is Winning the Social Media War, U.S. Concludes: An internal State Department assessment paints a dismal picture of the efforts by the Obama administration and its foreign allies to combat the ISs message machine, portraying a fractured coalition that cannot get its own message straight.
New images of dwarf planet Ceres, taken by NASA's Dawn spacecraft, show the cratered surface of this mysterious world in sharper detail than ever before. These are among the first snapshots from Dawn's second mapping orbit, which is 2,700 miles (4,400 kilometers) above Ceres.
A study, published today in Nature, demonstrates that ocean circulation is the link between weather and decadal scale climatic change. These findings imply that the global climate is on the verge of a broad-scale change that could last for a number of decades.
