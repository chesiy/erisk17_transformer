This is a brilliant way of looking at it. Thank you.
I'd prefer to go for CBT, its what I told my GP but I'm having to wait for 5 weeks so I feel a little bit abandoned.... :(
I feel the same. I've got a decent life but I still don't like it, I find anything wrong with it and over think it until I can find a reason to not like it.
Just a bit more, her boyfriend was more interested than she was.
Thank you for your advise, you have no idea how much it helped.
I told my 'best friend' about my depression. All I got was 'Sorry to hear about that test_subject3879'  Yeh cheers! Really f**king helpful!
I'm a girl but thanks 3 :)
I'm really looking forward to starting treatment and I'm happy that I've taken that leap to get treatment, we will see how it goes. I haven't got an addictive personality I don't believe anyway. I don't smoke, I very rarely drink even since finding out I've got depression.  I should really try and go to the gym but its having to get that motivation and when you've got your head telling you 'whats the point?' its hard to ignore it.  I find it hard to make friends, I'm not the popular one. I'm the girl who sat inside gaming all evening while my friends were out because I didn't enjoy going out, since then all my friends have abandoned me since I broke up with my ex-bf. The one friend I have barely speaks to me. Any other friends I have rarely speak to me. It's a vicious cycle of... no friends and it kills me.
I'm glad I'm not the only one to be honest. No offense.
If there is nothing that they can do then I feel like I'm wasting their time but then I feel... 5 more weeks of feeling like crap. Argh.
I live in the UK. I'm in a good situation, got a good job, got an amazing SO... sometimes I look at my life and keep thinking.. how can I be depressed? But then I remember I have no friends which is my main issue.  Thanks for your advise.
