Well don't be a bitch about it. Man up and tell the fucker off.
This is what I remember. Way back in 2002, I was working in the Pet Department and my job was to catch fish out of the aquarium. The fair was in town and when the fair is in town, it is BATSHIT crazy. All these kids winning goldfish and their parents would go in Wal-Mart to get fish bowls,food,etc. Well, one day after I got off lunch (I was eating at McDonalds in my store because no car) and my stomach was..lets say not playing nice with me. A woman with her Grandson came in with a bag of goldfish and wanted someone to catch a specific one as a mate to the one he won at the fair. I'm off to the floor, they call my name, I go straight to the aquariums. The lady wanted a fish out of the goldfish tank that had a stripe over the eye. Now, mind that the tank had 1000 goldfish and that catching the specific one is time consuming. I'm over at the tanks FOR 4 GOD DAMN HOURS trying my balls off to catch this fucking fish. Her kid is at the tank ohh and ahhing. The Grandparent is over there placing her fingers on the glass THE WHOLE GOD DAMN TIME pointing out this bastard. Stomach made a noise, then I fuckin farted. Loud. I mean it echoed down the aisle. As this gas was rumbling in the bowels of my ass hell, I tried to fake a cough. I farted, fake cough was off by 2 seconds. I didnt do shit but ignore it. I farted, we glanced at each other and no big deal was made. It stunk, I mean worse than dead fish. So, the next day I come in, manager calls me up. I go in, he is asking me questions about me being rude. I'm like..what do you mean? He explained to me that I was being rude in front of a customer. "What?". "How?" No response. I got fired, next day I get a call from a guy I worked with that explained to me that because of my loud, smelly fart I got wrote up and fired. Escorted off the premesis and signed papers saying I will never work with them again.
wonder if people that find them will give them back to him.  The fedora is strong with you.
That's why you stuff her panties in her mouth during fuckhour.

Look at him, speedy, quickly, yeah? Just touch that, you can see how pink it is already. Fucking hell. I just want you to know what you're doing! None of you are communicating, no-one's going together, no-one's making eye contact, and no-one's reminding each other as a team!
Thanks for the reply.
I'm sick of all these reposts, every repost someone has to repost a repost about it being a repost.
Let's review this shit.  How does a city reuse a former basketball arena when the team moves to new digs across town?   It was a rough place - the seediest dive on the wharf. Populated with every reject and cutthroat from Bombay to Calcutta. It's worse than Detroit.  And what if, hypothetically, that arena is shaped like a pyramid? This? Why, I can make a hat or a brooch or a pterodactyl..   If youre Memphis, you fill it with a 535,000 square-foot Bass Pro Shop, then sit back and wait for the apocalypse to arrive. Bad news. The fog's getting thicker. Built in 1991, Memphiss Great American Pyramid has been empty for over a decade, looming on the skyline like a bad idea conceived after too much cocaine. Numerous proposals have tried to revive the 32-story pyramid but none had the $191 million backing of Americas most audacious retailer. And Leon is getting laaaaarrrrrger.  In addition to the sales floor, the store is like a Vegas-scale Bubba Gump outpost including a cypress swamp with live alligators, a bowling alley, a restaurant, an observation deck, taxidermy museum, and a hotel. If these photos arent enough to convince you of humanitys impending doom, there are more images over at Bloomberg Businessweek. The store opened today.  There's no reason to become alarmed, and we hope you'll enjoy the rest of your flight. By the way, is there anyone on board who knows how to fly a plane?
I grew up watching you on Remote Control and Who's The Man? You are a funny fella, anywho I got a few questions to ask.   1) Tough Crowd ever gonna be on Netflix or released on DVD? 2) You ever meet Bill Hicks? (I want to say that Patrice O'neal was the Black Man's answer to Bill Hicks) 3) You ever see a worse move that this? It's called Hawkeye and it is sad. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOMitpwKJh4
