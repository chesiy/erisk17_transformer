Thirteen days in and I had yet to *really* sleep. Dawn and dusk bled into each other, just beautiful backdrops for the next drive-thru menu. Between jobs, I ate in my car. I wanted to go inside, but I also didn't want anyone to see me. Without a shower or fresh clothes or even a razor, it was hard to stay on top of things. So I'd order through a speaker box, the nameless person would accept my payment and into the anonymity of the twilight I would disappear, soggy-soaked bag on top of the pile of other soggy-soaked corpses in my passenger seat.  The absence of face-to-face interaction was common to my new job as well. Private contractor. I rented a space in a call center and said whatever they told me to.   "Set your own hours" they said, but I don't think that they could have anticipated what that would mean when I lost my boyfriend and my apartment. With nothing to do and less than no money to get by on, I spent all day there. I averaged 21 hours a day the first week. I didn't bother counting after that.  I was good at it, I guess. During the day I'd field calls from lonely people considering suicide. At night they were lonely people too poor or scared to pay for a hooker. The formula was simple. The longer you have someone on the line, the more you make. Just keep them talking. If someone climaxed or flat-lined they'd end the conversation.  I comforted old women as they cried themselves to sleep and an old man who called me Betsy after his deceased wife. That one climaxed early. I tantalized middle aged fathers of four and curled the toes of a shy 18-year-old.   That's probably why I was so good at it. I wasn't afraid to play a part. Whatever they wanted, I became. Never mind what the judgmental blonde at Wendy's thought of me, as long as I was hidden behind miles of electrical wire, I was perfect.  And then day 13 came. I know that it was day 13 because I was supposed to get a paycheck after two weeks.  The call started out normal enough. I didn't have to try hard to get him to open up to me. He said he liked the way women smelled. I told him that I'd just gone for a jog. He said he'd like me to sit on his face. I told him I'd sit on his lap until I got to know him a little better.  I could hear him moving around. Squirming, breathing harder. Some more practiced conversation and he sounded like a pantingt wolf. He was an easy client - if I were trying to get off quick. I threw him a curve ball.  "What's your team?"  "My team?" he asked, confused.   "Yeah. Your team. I mean, I can't be *getting involved* with a Yankee's fan or something."  "Baseball? Oh, I'm a Pirates fan."  "Really? Me too!"  Now, it sounds clich: baseball to take his mind off of sex. But it's playful and it works. Yes, I would have said that any team was my favorite. It makes them feel more like they're talking to a "real" woman they know instead of just someone pretending. Having an opinion, even a small one, makes you easier to relate to. It's something I picked up from the suicide side of things.  But in this case, I hadn't even had to pretend. I'd lived outside of Pittsburgh until I was 9 with my dad. Some of my best early memories are of going to Pirates games with him. I even had their bumper sticker on my car.  We got back to business, me trailing him, giving him just enough to keep wanting more. Then he asked something unexpected.  "What kind of car do you drive?"  I didn't have a rehearsed answer to this, nor could I think of any benefit of lying, so I told him the truth.  "A Ford Focus."  He didn't say anything for a little while and I had to ask if he was still there.  "The girl I like drives a Focus."  "Oh really? Well maybe that's your type."  "She never looks at me. God, she doesn't even know I exist."  And just like that the mood had shifted from night to day. We'd been talking for almost an hour. With the mood gone, the conversation wound down. I'd lost it. Fuck it, I was tired.  "And I hate my bullshit job! Some days I think I'll just end it. I'll just walk out and finish everything."  "Now don't say that. We're still friends aren't we?"  "I wish I really knew you," he said sentimentally.  "Me too," I said eyeing the clock.  "Maybe you'll see me next time," he said and hung up.  I took few more calls, but my heart wasn't in it. I decided that I should go and take a break. I'd already be getting a nice paycheck the next day, maybe enough to get into a cheap room, and could probably do with a few hours of sleep. I'd just get some junk food first.  I didn't notice right away. I got all the way to Wendy's first. A police cruiser was in the parking lot with its lights on. I drove up to the ordering box and started feeling around for my wallet. My hand found something like a pillow wrapped in plastic.  When I looked down onto the floor of the back seat, I saw him staring back up at me. Blank, purposeless eyes looking through a plastic bag wet with condensation. His gray skin and blue lips limp and dumb-looking. Outside the car, I screamed and my stomach heaved. A police officer starting walking over toward me. I couldn't resist taking another look, and saw that the guy in my car wasn't wearing pants.  One officer starting ushering me inside as the other opened the rear door. I heard him say "We found him," before I blacked out.
Beyond scary. That's terrible terrible terrible.  That's like The Hook crossed with the story of that lady who lived in the guys cupboards in Japan. Ugh.  I bet he crept down the stairs every day and whispered Goldilocks to himself as he strolled through your house.  And how did the ending get *so much worse*?  "And he was never caught."  So how do you even know it was just a man?
"Heart rate normalizing."  *Damn, that's strong. Clear cut. It might even be beautiful if it weren't going to end up killing him.*  "Nurse, do those cameras work?"  "Yes, doctor."  "Could you have someone turn them on, please?"  "Yes, sir. But... why?"  "I'll explain as I go."  I looked over at the anesthesiologist. "We're okay for about ten more minutes, right?"  "We're doing good now. He didn't like whatever you just poked, though. Heart rate shot right up."  "Camera's are on, doctor."  "Thank you.  "This is Doctor Edward Harris. It's June 21st, 2015 at Maine Medical Center. Please, just read the first page of the chart for the cameras if you would, nurse."  "Patrick D'aury, 24 years old, male. Self-admitted with no other family or friends on June 21st complaining of pain in the left arm from a human bite. No apparent physical wounds were found despite large amounts of blood being present. Patient began to seize. PET/CT scan showed a mass in the lower brain - "  "Thank you. The patient experiences phantom pain and delusion while awake and under general anesthesia."  "Ahem. Delusion wouldn't exist under anesthesia."  "Patients don't dream when they're unconscious?"  "No."  "Are you completely sure?"  "Heart rate is rising."  "Brain is lighting up like a christmas tree."  "He's moving."  "Doctor, you're killing him!"  "Heart rate is stabilizing."  "What the fuck is this? Did you kink the tube or something?"  "He had a dream. A bad one, probably, or an exciting one. When mild electrical stimulus is applied directly to the tumor, the patient dreams."  "He *can't* dream. He's -- "  "I'll do it again. Nurse, please watch his eyes and make sure that it's recorded by the camera."  "They're not moving, they're just...  "Wait. That... That's REM."  "Thank you. It's inoperable to say the least. One of a few fast-growing cancerous masses that seeds deep into the brain stem. They're unique. One-in-a-billion, one-in-two-billion. And yet, one of *seven* found in the past two weeks."  "You're sure, doctor?"  "Take that tape, have it sent to the CDC."  "The CDC?"  "Cut the anesthesia."  "But we haven't closed up yet."  "Tie him down. Use the heaviest restrains that you've got."  "Tie him - what's going on here?"  "Leave the brain open. I need him awake. I have to be able to ask him questions. And I have to be able to stop him."  "Sir, this is unethical. It's wrong! He'll feel everything!"  "I hope to God that he does. If he's like the others, though, he's already lost that. First the senses, and then the memories. Once cognition goes, he *will* be dangerous."  "Restraints are in place."  "Everyone out."  "O-out?"  "This is on me. If he's progressing the same as the others, I can't allow him to live. I also will not allow any of you to accept the responsibility of taking a life with me."  I pulled the pistol out of my scrubs and pointed it at each of them as they left the room.  The patient was starting to move. Eyes flicking, mouth working.  "Patrick. Patrick, can you hear me?  "Patrick, do you know where you are?  "Tell me what day it is.  "Answer me, Patrick. Come on, ***are you alive in there?***"
Nice! Thanks for the help.
Welcome!  Did you want them wider? There might be a way...
Seriously, though. Yep.
He donned the fitted mask, suit and gloves, careful to inspect the seams for weak points where the noxious gases could enter. It was Spring now, with snow still gripping onto the planet's surface. He was reasonably worried about exposure, especially in the long term. The young scientist was feeling better about his decision already. He could picture them, homeless, huddled cold and starving under the overpass near the park. The two serums clinked as he put them into his Velcro pocket. Two subjects. If he was right, one of them wouldn't spend another day down on the planet's harsh surface. And the other... Well...
Definitely nuked. I've heard rumors that he's doing alright, just not redditing anymore. Miss the little bugger.
...shit.
364 Days.
That actually seems to fit better, though it's not what I was trying to write about. Happy coincidence.  Edit: The long way of saying my boss is fucking me and locking me away in his sex dungeon.
Walter Simon was a...   71-year-old Walter Simon was a...  Well, actually, there isn't anything interesting that's known about Walter. He just seems like a regular guy. The only thing that any of his neighbors knew about Walter was that he had a coconut tree growing in his front yard -- seemingly the only one in the state.  It's what is *un*known that's interesting.  Twice, Walter has seen a man walking swiftly through the woods behind his house, holding a very long, silver string. The first time was as a child. Young Walter pressed his nose against the glass and then peeked around the steam that his breath had left.  The second time, Walter was a young man in Vietnam. It was late, and he was the only person awake in the camp. When the man walked by carrying the string, Walter ran after him, trying to find out who he was.  This morning, as Walter went into his garage to put food out for his cats, Percival and Missy, he found a dead body. The blood had soaked into the oil stains in the center of the concrete floor.  Not being one to panic or despair, Walter continued to put food in his cats bowls, and decided to come back to the body later when he'd had his coffee.  It was fast approaching midnight, and Walter was sitting at his dining room table, staring over a pile of bills and out the rear window of his house. Staring, and thinking of what to do about the deceased gentleman in his garage.   Walter isn't one to dwell on the past, and so the question of "How did he get there?" is brushed aside in favor of the more practical "What can be done now?"  A tiny sliver of light waves and dances, dragging across the trees and brush in his back yard. The silver string gives off a faint light.  He must hurry.  Walter emptied his largest duffel bag of its contents. He laid it on the floor of the garage, and rolled the body into it. A bit heavy, but he managed to stand with it. Once up and with his balance intact, the dead weight draped over his shoulders, Walter carried the body out into his back yard.  He *must* hurry.  The branches slapped and scratched at his face, and the unlevel, wet ground nearly causes him to lose his footing, but then he spotted it, just ahead, snagged on a broken limb. The string.  Walter looped the bit of silver through the handles, then around the bag, then back through the handles. He remembered how to tie a good strong knot. When he's done, he wipes the silver residue from his hands and gets back to his feet.  The slack went out of the line. It tugged, then dragged its new burden slowly and steadily across the forest floor, and just before it went out of sight, Walter gave his very smartest salute to the moon.
All I can picture now is a parent being woken by the sounds of their two kids fighting. They walk into the other bedroom and shut the whole thing down.  "If you two can't share, then no one can have it!"
Reddit eats single carriage returns. Either put two spaces at the end of the line or do a double carriage return to get it to work.  From the sidebar: Tags are not allowed in titles except to indicate that the post is part of a series.  So don't try to put a [Dark Humor] tag in your title. Are you sure you're submitting to the right subreddit? /r/DarkTales seems like it might be more appropriate for a dark humor story.  I don't know why the post isn't working. Does reddit give you an error? Nosleep's moderation is done through users or bots so if you're getting a reddit error, it's bigger than this sub.

Here's the thing. /r/NoSleep is pretty restrictive in their rules. It's sometimes hard to write for, because most of the time it necessitates everything being in first person.  /r/ShortScaryStories can be about anything, but there's the length restriction. That's not good or bad, it just is, and I think it definitely has its place. The only problem with it is that people are editing their stories down to 274 words to fit them in here. That's not necessarily the best thing for the story.  /r/DarkTales is non-restrictive. It's not even just Horror, it's anything dark. Maybe some people have been turned off by the sidebar. Maybe people don't know what it is.  You have to mention /r/LetsNotMeet as well, since it's basically the way that /r/NoSleep was in the beginning, and it's got 95,500 subscribers - nearly twice the size of /r/shortscarystories.  The point is, I would assume that /r/DarkTales would have the most subscribers, /r/shortscarystories would have the second most and /r/NoSleep would have the least. Not even factoring in the default status of /r/NoSleep, it's exactly the opposite. Why? How did they form that way?  /r/LibraryofShadows is as abandoned as a real library. The librarian checks in once every few months to make sure it hasn't burned down or collect the insurance money. The users that do accidentally stumble in there don't seem to actually read anything judging by the votes.  EDIT: Oops, i meant /r/TheTruthIsHere (33,000), not /r/LetsNotMeet.
The poor, unsuspecting public!  Seriously though? Knowing that you wrote that a long time ago is really interesting. I think you're a phenomenal writer now. This may not have been the greatest thing, but shit, you did a lot right! You built characters and layered on a plot, which sounds basic, but those are things that a lot of people just *can't* do. So all flaws considered,  It's actually inspiring that you shared this.  Thanks.
It should have been obvious from the title, but I didn't see it coming. Get 'im, KMA!
Nicely done!
That's one way to look at it, thanks. Makes me feel a little bit better.
This made me cringe. It wasn't about the "twist" or "figuring it out." You know. You can see it from the beginning.  It's about watching OP who can't tell. It's about their willful ignorance of reality and the tension lies in how far they're going to take it - what are they going to do next?  Totally creepy. You're fucked up, OP. You need some help.
What? You're stopping there? You just got warmed up.  Also, you forgot to say "most violent scene **so far**."  Come on. What are you *really* going to do instead? Wouldn't it be better to get a little bit ahead for once?
Vote.

The Ghost Thief   From [this prompt](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/28lw8q/ip_the_ghost_thief/)  [The Ghost Thief](http://www.kimsokol.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/GhostThief.jpg) by [Kim Sokol](http://kimsokol.tumblr.com/)  ---  The girl opened her pack and extracted a fat green bottle wrapped in fur. It was one she'd used several times before for this exact dark purpose. The crumbling cork slid loosely out of the opening. She crouched next to the lifeless body at her feet, her tight leather armor creaking softly as she moved. With a muffled word and a mysterious swish of her hand, the air in front of her glowed softly, then faded.  With a frustrated swear, she repeated the charm. The light glowed a little brighter this time and Jarod, standing in the shadows, thought that he could just see the outline of a tortured face being framed in the glow. This spell faded as well, and the girl swore louder. Jarod couldn't see why the blonde thief would even bother. This area had hosted several wars throughout the years and remains were plentiful; one only needed to look around the cave that they were in to know that. Wasting an enchanted bottle to capture this spirit wouldn't bring her any fortune, especially from here. No, this was something else.  On the third try, the thief's spell illuminated a satisfied smile on her face and caused Jarod to slink behind a pile of bones. The face, glowing in the darkness, was stretched and almost as thin as the skulls lining the walls. She began to reel the spirit into the bottle with one waving hand. Obviously clumsy with magic, her brow pinched in concentration. Jarod thought how easy it would be to incapacitate the girl right now. He had cause; the body she knelt over had belonged to his mentor, a silver-robed mage that had earned some renown in a long-ago age. Therein lied the reason that Jarod stayed his attack. The apprentice felt that he had long ago gleaned all he could from the old man with his strict code and laws, and finding him dead at a cutpurse's hand lifted his spirits.  Her work was complete. She carefully wrapped the glowing bottle and set it into her bag with the rest of her collection, considered the cavern around her and set out, her new shadow creeping along the tunnels behind her.  The town of Zale, where Jarod and his master had come was due east. The girl struck a path to the south through the woods. He admired how at home she seemed to be, even as she avoided the main paths. Early on, he had summoned a sphere of silence around himself so that the girl wouldn't hear him breaking branches and twigs. Her own magic seemed to be grounded in her skill and dexterity; he hadn't heard her once. For reasons he couldn't fully explain, he was captivated by the girl; her beauty seemed to grow with each obstacle she overcame.  He began to feel the length of the trek taking its toll. Briars and branches had claimed the hem of his robe, and his cloth shoes, once cobalt blue were now brown and caked with mud. His mark emerged from the trees onto a wide dirt road. Her pace had never slowed in the brush, but now she clipped along even faster.  The road ended in a wide, flat valley that housed a community of small farms. In the center of the valley, a group of huddled buildings stood above than the rest. The sun was setting on the hills framing the village. Against its glow, the girl's silhouette disappeared into one of the buildings. That was fine by Jarod.  For twelve years the young mage had studied under his old master. Creatures, places, artifacts, scrolls, tomes... It had been an endless cycle, a tedious life. He intended to study the girl in her own environment, untainted by his observation, as he would have studied a Pixie or a Bogg Toad. He wasn't in search of companionship; he only wanted to know her, while enjoying the power that anonymity afforded him. That power swirled and mixed with the feeling of freedom inflating in his chest as he found his way to the cluster of buildings.  The only building with light and activity coming from within it was an inn that doubled as a tavern and a small trading post. A squat, mustached man frowned at Jarod's undeniably impractical and dirty clothes from behind a wooden counter. In the next room was a tavern where hardy farmers were gathered around handmade tables where they were loudly sharing cups and tales.  Jarod's hand made a subtle movement and the mustached man's frown became dulled and the light left his eyes. "I'll be needing a room and clothes. You don't need to know my name or my business, only that I wish to be left alone." He set a pile of coins on the wooden countertop. "I am quite sure that this will be sufficient to cover my stay. My key, please."  ---  A short time later, Jarod descended the stairs wearing black pants and boots with a forest green traveling cloak. The noise from the small pub rose up the steps to greet him. Ignoring the man at the counter, he grabbed the handle of the door to leave. Jarod released the handle and his hand slowly dropped to his side. He turned his focus back to the bar. Standing there, next to a group of men at the table, was the one he'd been following. He walked into the bar and pulled out an empty chair at one of the tables - the only empty chair in the room. The strangers stared at him for a moment, but Jarod's gaze was fixed on the girl as she went from table to table, laughing and joking with the men she obviously knew. Her dexterity and finesse were obvious here as well, and her beauty more so. Two of the others at Jarod's table went back to their stories. The third tapped him on the shoulder with enough force to .  In normal circumstances, the mage would have resented the uncalled for touch, but the discomfort of his clothes was a constant reminder that he was in disguise. He swallowed his discomfort and looked toward the man. A thick beard was soaked with mead, and he smelled like dirt and sweat. "She's somethin' huh?"  "Something... Yes. Do you know her?"  "Sure do. That's the girl I'm gonna marry."  "You are her betrothed?"  "Well... no. She doesn't actually know me jus' yet. Gotta work up a little courage is all."  "You've never actually met her, then?"  "Oh, I met 'er. She... might not 'a got my name right..."  "I see."  "She's such a cute li'l thing. Her family's got a farm back toward the red hill." The young man tried to focus through his inebriation in order to take in Jarod's appearance. Before he could finish, the girl had appeared beside the table.  "Hi, Bill. Mort." She nodded to the old men at the table. "Another drink for both of you?" Both nodded and went back to their conversation. "And you two... well, hello. I don't believe I've seen you here before" she said, looking at Jarod. "Brothers?" Jarod glanced at the other man ogling the girl. Thick arms and shoulders flanked a barrel-chest with a wild blond beard hanging over it. The two could not have been more dissimilar.  "Ah, no. Afraid not. I'd like to purchase a drink for my new friend..." Jarod dragged out the last line, hoping that the lovestruck man at his side would offer a name. It didn't come, but the object of his affection kindly ignored the awkward pause.   As she left, the the oldest man at the table leaned over toward Jarod. "Ye don' want to be gettin' yer hopes up with tha' one," he slurred. "Strange, she is."  "Hear tell she's a necker-mancer," the fourth man whispered loudly enough to hear over the din of the crowded room.  "She ain't no necromancer! She's a *collector*. She collects things 'n puts 'em up in her ol' man's barn.  "Well, her ma an' 'er ol' man are weird ones too. Whole family of 'em out by Red Hill."  "Point bein'... Ye're best to leave 'er alone." At this, the bearded man looked slightly crestfallen. The barmaid arrived with the drinks and smiled at everyone else at the table before locking her gaze onto Jarod. For several seconds, she just stared. Jarod shifted in his seat and felt himself start to sweat. The moment passed and her smile returned before leaving.  "She winked at me!" shouted the bearded man. She certainly hadn't, but no one was cold enough to correct him.  "You said that she's a 'collector,' what did you mean by that?"  "Naw, I said she a '*necker*-man-"  "Shut up, Mort! I already told ya, she's not a necromancer." The man turned back to Jarod. "Her an' her family aren't from here. They came from some place I never heard of. That was 'bout four, five years ago now. So they show up outta the blue, and they buy a farm and then stuff just start disappearing."  "Stuff?"  The blonde walked close by the group's table and the man telling the story lowered his voice, ominously. "Yeah, stuff. Had about five of us out in the woods picking this certain kind o' mushroom. We sit down for some lunch and when we get to movin' again, no' one of us can find our bags. A whole morning's work, gone."  "Oy, I 'ad somebody trod off with me flask once. D'ya think-"  "I r'member yer flask well enough, Mort. I r'member 'cause I saw it fall in the lake when we was out fishin'." Bill shot him a look to silence him, but the man was occupied trying to pull something out of his pockets. "As I was sayin'- er... what was I sayin'?"  "So you think they stole your mushrooms?"  "Not just the mushrooms. People started to notice they were losin' their stuff from all over town. Their old stuff. Like Grappler's gran gave 'im a locket from 'afore the war, Brawn had a set o' armor his pa gave 'im. I 'ad a nice knife from me ma... used it fer cuttin' carrots. Stuff that was right inside peoples' homes, an' it just went missin'."  "You think she's got somrthing to do with it?"  "Well I dunno if it's *her* exactly's doin' it, but she's got the stuff in her old man's barn, that's fer sure."  "Yeah 'n my flask! It were green 'n fat."  "Was it glass?" Jarod asked.  "Yeah! How'd you guess that?" the man asked in wonder.  Without pausing, he responded "If it had been metal, surely the two of you would have been able to recover it when it fell into the lake." Bill laughed loud and drunkenly. Jarod followed the girl with his eyes for a while. "So, Bill, if everything is there in the barn, why hasn't anyone gone in and taken it back?"  Bill looked around him, lowered his head so that the tip of his beard just dipped into his cup of ale, but didn't lower his voice whatsoever. "It's haunted."  Jarod perked up at this, pulling his gaze from the girl. Mort burst out, "See! That's what I' been tryin'a say. She's a necker-"  "She ain't!"  "Well then what's that I seen her doin'-"  "You ain't seen shit, Mort."  "Please," Jarod ventured softly. "I'd like to hear what Mort here has to say."  It was Mort's turn to scowl at Bill, and he relished in the moment for a long second. "As I say. I seen the girl ou' in the woods one night, 'n I think she might'a been hunting 'cause there were something dead by 'er. So's she stops 'n pulls out this little bottle - blue, like the sky - and starts wavin' her hands and sayin' some kind o' spell. Then outta nowheres, that dead thing's spirit starts floatin' up, glowin' real bright in the dark, and she stuffs the thing into her blue bottle. I think that dead thing was a man... but I never went close enough to see. Ye' ever hear anything like it?"  "Actually, I have."  "Told you!" shouted Mort.  "Now hold on! The mister din't say boo 'bout necromancers yet."  "Sorry, Mort. I don't think that she is a necromancer. I don't think that she's much of a magician at all, actually. There are simple charms that one can procure to give the power to capture a departed soul in an enchanted container. Now, do you know of why she might want to do such a thing?" Jarod allowed their silence to linger a moment before answering his own question.   "Because she's a collector."  A smile spread back into Bill's face. "Yeah!"  The souls that she had taken were nearly worthless, but they might have contained sentimental value. However, if he could get inside the barn where she kept it, he may yet find some artifacts of worth.  Oddly, not a single customer had left the tavern yet. The starstruck young man had fallen asleep, a line of drool was strung from his beard to the table, and nearly hung to the ground.  Jarod stood, his drink was only half-finished, but he felt his balance waver for a moment.  The cool air of night blew across his body. He supposed for a moment that he should have asked where exactly the barn was, however it wasn't necessary. The mage had other means. The soft orange lights of the tiny town shrank behind him. In the darkness, he thrust his hand high into the air, feeling for the pulse of magic. Puzzled, Jarod lowered his hand. He felt magic all around him.  In the field beside him he heard rustling. It was getting closer. The young mage raised his hands in front of him, ready to react with fire and wind to whatever may come from the tall plants.  The soul thief emerged. She was wearing her thieves' leather again. Seemingly oblivious to Jrod's presence, she plodded down the road in front of him.  Jarod tried to count the number of things that had made him feel uneasy today. He traced the girl's writhe silhouette in the light, and forgot to feel uneasy. He followed.  Though something was interfering with his senses, Jarod didn't require a spell to know that the barn that he was approaching was something special. It simply hummed with mystery. Looking directly at it, the structure appeared normal. If he looked through the corner of his eyes, it appeared to have a faint glow just at the edges, as though it was filled with light and the corners sprung a leak.
Who is she? - First story.   Based on [this image](http://i.imgur.com/RooQxpY.jpg) by [Aaron Needham](http://aaronneedham.tumblr.com/post/59853349209/aaron-needham) posted [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1lh9md/ip_who_is_she/)  This was the first story I ever posted to Reddit. September 1, 2013.  ---  Looking back, I wonder if I was crazy before I even left. That was four days ago, when I loaded into my Volkswagen Rabbit and headed into the New Mexico desert for the night. To think... At that point I would have done anything to just run away.  That car had never been a real winner. I bought it off a kid from my high school as he left for college. It was a washed out silver/blue piece of shit that he'd spray painted a skull and crossbones onto the front. And to top it off, I knew fuck all about cars.  So when it broke down about 4 hours from the last time I saw a paved road and started pissing oil and billowing steam from the engine, I was helpless. I checked my phone, standing on top of the car and just saw one middle finger of a signal bar pop up before the battery died and the screen went black.  I was silently furious. Furious with myself for pushing the limits of how far I could get out into the blank desert. Furious with my mom for getting arrested and making me have to move out here to New Mexico with my dad in the first place.  The sun started to go down, and I started walking. I couldn't follow the rabbit's tracks because I knew there was nothing at all back that way. So I picked a direction perpendicular to them, South I guess, and started walking.  I wasn't really sure how worried I should have been at that point. I just figured that I'd have to find something. I should have been a lot more concerned.  I walked as far as I could that first night. Without the sun it got cold and harder to maintain my direction. I walked for hours. Sometimes humming songs to myself, sometimes yelling for help, sometimes yelling curses at my parents. After a while though, I just walked.  I slept that morning until the heat and the light woke me up, then started walking again. All I remember is walking, walking on with my eyes closed against the harsh white brightness of the desert. When the darkness came again I sat and rested my legs. My mind was blank and numb from the day. Burned away from the sun. I remember crying a lot, but I don't remember feeling anything but tired.  In the middle of the night I started walking again. I had to get out. Another day like that could kill me. I started hearing things in the darkness. Scuffles of animals moving, following me. Waiting for me to drop dead.  It was only a few eternities into the next day when I saw a building in the shimmering distance. A cry of relief passed my cracked lips as it came into focus.  A barn.  I knocked until my knuckles stung, cracked and bled on that fucking shed. There was no one there. There was no evidence of anyone being there. Not even a dirt road or indentions of tires worn into the desert. It was just a corrugated metal shed that had sprung up out of the desert.  At noon, the sliver of shade on the side of the shed went away. I hung my head and started walking again.  More hours. More heat. More nothing. The sun was settling onto the horizon.  Suddenly, screams pierced the evening air - some kind of horrible monster in the distance.  My legs didn't respond when I commanded them to run. It was all I could do to turn and shuffle away from the screams. The sound was loud and inhuman. I looked back and saw dust being kicked up in a cloud headed straight for me. A growling, snarling noise joined the ear-splitting screams.  Then, nothing. I looked back to see a great white beast crouched and ready to pounce, the dust settling around it. I stumbled and fell onto my back. And for a moment I admired the reds and oranges of the sunset. A Tequila Sunrise spilt over the vast open canvas of the sky.  Onto that canvas, a woman's head and shoulders appeared. In the low light, her skin appeared blue. Her face held a look of blank, serious determination. The same look that had been melted onto my face.  A fellow wanderer.  I felt calm.   Then after a small movement, she held a knife, and all calm that I had felt was replaced with animal fear. The realization that the beast was still there, a few yards behind her, and that she was somehow a part of that beast. A monster to be feared. There to end my long march at last.  She didn't end me there in the desert under that fiery sunset. Instead, she brought me back into the world that I sought to escape; brought me here to the hospital in the belly of what a fevered mind saw as a great white beast.  Who is she?   She is the one who saved me.
Run.

The Old Hospital [Part 1]   EDIT: For you visual people, I drew up a [model](http://imgur.com/a/FDpQE) of the first floor.  The hospital grounds sat in the middle of the town like a bullseye. This was most likely a coincidence; the oldest parts of the town were closest to the river that formed the southern boundary and over time, the town had expanded North and East. The newest building, and the furthest North, was a medium-sized retail store that the town had fought to boycott. Towns that grow over a long period of time are devoid of any master plan, since people just add what they need when they need it. In this case, the evidence all over town could be found in the large expanses of forest and sand dunes that were left between one developed area of town and the next. If a place had been too costly to build on, it was skipped over.  After the "old" hospital, which it was still referred to, was closed in 1990, the small patches of forest around it took back the grounds in only a matter of months. The building itself fell to a different sort of wilderness. Being out of view from the street below, daring high-schoolers and vagrant meth addicts moved in. in only a few days, every one of the windows had been broken out. In a couple weeks, some had tried to burn it down. After more than 20 years, it looked like the place was about to fall down.  "The police don't really come up here any more," explained Ryan. "They just kind of drive through the parking lot and check to see if the place is still standing. If it isn't on fire or there isn't a car parked in the lot, they don't even check inside." From the passenger seat in Ryan's car, it was easy enough to see why it didn't require security to keep people out. Yellow caution tape was off-putting. The collapsed ceiling and dark, metal-screened windows were threatening. The place looked downright dangerous.  "Why doesn't someone just tear it down?" I wondered aloud.  "Well, are we going to do this?" Ryan killed the headlights, casting the building in blue light from the one streetlamp over the gravel parking area. I took a sledge from the trunk I'd borrowed from Nicole's house. Ryan had brought a crowbar as well, but just in case we found anything serious in there, Ryan had brought his pistol. Guns usually make me nervous, but I counted having an armed, off-duty cop with me as a good thing.  "Now, that - " Ryan said, pointing to the chained set of double doors just to the right of a sign saying [Town] Medical Clinic, "- is the main entrance. There's no key anymore, but people have found other ways to get in." He took us around the left side of the building where we found a door propped crookedly in its frame. The nails of its hinges had pulled out of the soft, moldy wood. Once we were inside, we turned our our flashlights on and got our first look at the inside. Something about being in that place was really unsettling. Thick patches of green moss had grown over the floor and walls near the windows and  doors. Beneath the holes in the ceiling, huge ferns grew out of the dark, wet carpet. Under everything was a slimy layer of green mold. It smelled like a forest. A large beam had fallen from the ceiling across the room like a downed tree trunk, adding to the clutter and claustrophobia of the small room.  Have you ever seen the footage of scuba divers or those robotic submarines who sift through old shipwrecks and underwater buildings? That's what it reminded me of. Everything had something growing on it, and there was dust hanging in the air, unmoving. It was the silence that really drew the similarity; it was thick and oppressive, as if there were a thick, weighted blanket over everything.  That first room looked like a break room, or staff area. Against the left wall was a small kitchenette area, with cabinets along the floor and ceiling and a sink set into the counter top. Across from the door we'd just come through was a gaping black hole that had once been a doorway. Some long-ago fire had rounded its edges, leaving an oblong black portal. To the right, was a staff bathroom area, which had a couple of lockers, a shower and a toilet. We had to be careful walking across the floor. Shards of glass from the broken window and mirror in the bathroom were scattered across the carpet. Near the doorway, the fire had eaten through the floor, exposing the supports.  The next room was bigger, looking like it might have been a place to gather everyone at the hospital together at once. It had the most evidence that people had been living in it. Bottles, beer cans and black trash bags were in every corner and across the floor. A sleeping bag lay crumpled under the black, grated window against the far wall. Metal folding chairs were scattered about, casting long black shadows along the ground as Ryan and I shined our lights.  Through a larger door on the right-hand side of that room was a long hallway. This was the main leg of the hospital which consisted of five separate rooms with tattered, white curtains hanging in the doorways. I couldn't see all the way to the end of the hall. It looked like it just kept going and going. The wall on our left, opposite of the rooms, was made almost entirely out of metal-caged windows that looked out onto a small porch. During the daytime, you could have seen the trees and bushes beyond.  It was here that I began to have the feeling of being watched. The metal crosshatch pattern over the windows and abysmal blackness beyond made it impossible to see out. I imagined it was something like a one-way mirror. If someone had been standing outside, they could have been watching us like gerbils in a cage.  Ryan and I checked the first hospital room on our right. Everything had been stripped and removed, even the cupboard doors and drawers. A tiny slit of a window on the back wall of each room let in light from the one bluish streetlamp that illuminated the parking area outside.  Ryan went inside, and I stayed watch. Watching for what, I don't know, but I ended up staring into the blackness at the far end of the hall. Maybe it was my imagination or my anxiety, but I thought I heard something down there, a soft shuffle in the dark. There was no echo; being inside that place was like being in a vacuum. I turned off my light, and just looked and listened. My fear grew, as I focused on anything at the end of the hall. It was so dark, I could see the phosphene swirls I normally only see when I close my eyes. It was silent, but I was sure that there was someone there, at the end of the hall. My heart rate rose, I could feel it in my tense shoulders. Was that a sound? A whisper?  I was shaken out of my concentration by Ryan's hand grabbing my arm. "You okay?" I hadn't seen his flashlight illuminate the hall way around me.  "Yeah..." I didn't know whether to tell him that I'd heard something or whether I'd been just been daydreaming. "Let's split up, I'll check the front door and see what's at the end of the hallway."  "Sure," Ryan said, going into the second room. As quietly as I could, listening as I went, I went to the far end of the hall. The reason we hadn't been able to see anything at the end was that there was a wall made of strips of flat black rubber hanging from the ceiling. I parted them and shined my light through. The smell of mold invaded my sinuses. Past the curtain, the linoleum floor turned into finished, smooth cement. The hallway dropped off in a downward slope, ending in a pool of standing water.  Before the curtain, alongside the patients rooms, was a moderately-sized reception area. Light streamed in from the parking lot through the locked front doors. On the left was a tall reception desk built into the floor and wall. Behind that was a computer desk and some rusted-out file cabinets. The metal cabinets had signs of being pried open long ago. As was to be expected, nothing interesting was left. Whatever papers had been left behind had probably been burned, leaving more charred areas on the floor.  I turned to leave, but something behind the computer desk flashed, catching my eye. Fallen in the area between the desk and the wall was a glass frame of some sort. Mold had grown inside the glass, and water had damaged the printer paper inside, but you could still make out the words "visiting" near the top, and "unwanted" near the bottom right corner. Nothing with a doctor's name on it.  I left the reception area, expecting Ryan to be nearly done checking the patient rooms. I didn't see any light.  "Ryan?" I called weakly, moving back down the hall. The feeling of being watched was overwhelming and the hairs on my neck stood straight up. Ryan didn't answer. In the second room I found him standing stock-still, facing the wall, his dark flashlight in his right hand. He was staring at a broken mirror above a tiny porcelain sink. "Hey. Find something?" I asked cautiously, staying outside the doorway.  He turned his whole head ninety degrees to look at me, taking a full second to respond He shook his head like he was shaking off a dream, "No." He seemed to have snapped out of whatever trance he'd been in. "Fuck this place, man." At that moment, I was so glad to have Ryan with me. Who knows how long he or I would have sat there, staring off into space without the other there to pull them back to reality.  "Yeah. You get the feeling like we're being watched from out there?" I asked, gesturing outside the large, glassless windows.  "Now that you mention it, yeah. Thanks for that." He said with a sly smile, joining me in the hallway. "Only one place left to go." He pointed his light at the rubber curtain.  It occurs to me now that there was one more room we didn't check. The fifth patients room. We hadn't found anything in the other four, and it seemed like there was a slim chance we'd have better luck with the fifth. At least, that's what we thought at the time. Maybe that was where we went wrong.  ---  EDIT:   [Part 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/21zwx7/the_old_hospital_part_2/)   [Part 3](http://goo.gl/xgTQni)   [Home](http://goo.gl/u84b4A)
I Came Back Home and They Tried to Kill Me.   I don't know where to start. If you haven't read the rest of this series, you may want to do that now, in order for this to make sense. If this even can make sense.  [1](http://goo.gl/mUbcoc) [2](http://goo.gl/3jXhS8) [3](http://goo.gl/Omv2sC)  Last week my uncle, the last living relative I had in my hometown, died. With him gone, the police and other prominent members of the town had me followed away from town. They also took some pictures which had revealed after my mother's death that I had had a sister who died before I was born.  The police warned me not to get involved. They said it would be better if I got away while I still could. They said that the people who were at my uncle's house after his "suicide" were dangerous people. People capable of making someone, a child, disappear.   In spite of that, I had to know. If I'm being really honest, what I wanted more than anything else was to finally put my past to rest. That's the real reason I came back to Oregon after my mother died. The feeling throughout my whole life that the town I'd grown up in was rotten, backwards and wrong.  After I was sure the police had stopped following me, I turned around and came back to my mother's house. I'd been staying there and doing research on the town. I'd started with some of the prominent members of the town and their families.  What I learned is that many of the older adults who "run" the town, from the fire and ambulance services, to the schools, construction, police, commerce, and even the mayor have something in common. They all have past records of being homeless. Almost every well-known person in town that I could think of had something like this. Suspiciously missing from this list was Pastor Charles, the massive man who operated the local church. This wouldn't necessarily mean anything, of course. However, it did seem strange that all these prominent people had come from around the country, and in fact the world, to this one small town and had all done extremely well here.  I began to shift my search to what might have drawn them here. In the 1960's through the 1980's, jobs had been as plentiful as the trees here. Then in the 1990's, those jobs had dried up.  I found a few old scans of newspaper articles from the 1990's (since none of the people who were still here were involved in the fishing or timber industries), but none of them showed any kind of attraction to this town in particular. Good schools, fast growth, but little else. So I went to the library, where they kept a near-complete collection of local newspapers and found a front-page article from 1985, which included a black-and-white picture of a ribbon-cutting ceremony in front of a huge pharmaceutical plant. A man in a black suit who I didn't recognize was holding the scissors in the age-old pose, but it was the people behind him that shocked me. There they stood, half of the people I felt were responsible for whatever was wrong with this town. And my father in a white lab coat.  I went to print the page article and got an error message about paying a fee to the librarian. Stupidly, I went to the front desk. As I approached, the girl working there did a double take, and then slowly got up and walked to the back room.  It was time to leave.  I got in my car and scribbled down what I could remember from the article. "Newport Pharmaceuticals Plant Opens Doors." "55 new jobs." "November 13, 1985."  I'd never heard of any kind of plant near here or "Newport Pharmaceuticals." As far as I'd known, my father had moved here shortly after he was born, and the whole time I'd been growing up, he'd never had a job for longer than a year.  I headed back to my mother's house to see what I could find on the internet. I hid the car as before and walked up to the front. I was walking up the driveway when I saw the neighbor sitting on the front porch. She'd seen me, so I couldn't get away, though she was smiling as if she was happy to see me.  She said she was locked out of her house, and came to see if my mother had a spare key. She must have been going absolutely senile, because she didn't even seem to realize that she hadn't seen me since I was 18. In fact, the last time I'd seen her was after one of my mother's fits when she'd kicked me out of the house. I'd ended up going next door and having dinner. Even though I'd had to sit through an hour of her and her husband tell me about how it wasn't that bad and that I should forgive my mother, the food had at least been good.  I told her that my mother was dead, and she looked so sad. "Oh no. Oh, you poor thing," she said, coming closer with her arms outstretched. I half-heartedly returned the tiny woman's hug, eager to get inside where I wouldn't be seen, when I thought I felt an insect sting me on my ribs.  I went to brush it away, but didn't feel anything remaining on the spot where I'd felt the bite. Then I realized that the old woman was smiling widely again. I started to feel dizzy, and tried to escape back to my car, but before I could even make it off the porch, I was unable to walk. Suddenly, several people came from inside the house and carried me into a car.  They drove me to the lake, and loaded me into a small boat. Two older men, one who owned a furniture store in town, and the other who I'd seen before, but didn't know his name, took me in the boat to the deep center of the lake.  [I don't swim.](http://goo.gl/Rk6nmc) I haven't been able to get over my fear of open water since I was 12 years old, when I saw something terrible lurking deep under this same lake. It was dark now, the only lights were the colored running lights. I fought to move, to fight, to get away, to scream. Anything. I couldn't move. I could barely breathe, my chest felt like it was being crushed. The two men were waiting for something that I couldn't see, and after what felt like an hour, I finally gave up. I felt cold, and tears streamed down my face as I lay in the bottom of the fishing boat.  One of the men broke the silence, "There. Let's do it."  One grabbed my arms as the other grabbed my ankles, and with a grunt, they heaved my body like a bag of cement over the side of the boat.  I know that I drowned. I felt every second of it, clearly as I am sitting here typing this out. The fear forced the precious air out of my lungs and I sank, serene and peaceful, down into the black.  Inside my mind, a primal panic broke loose again, creating chaos but my body remained motionless. The last thing I remember was the intense pressure, and the sensation of losing consciousness.  Then, impossibly, I woke up. It was almost like going through a door, on the one side was one world, the world you feel when you're awake, the "real world." And then on the other side, I woke up into a completely different world, in a different place. I wasn't in the lake any more. I stood up in the middle of an empty house I'd never seen before. There was enough light to see around myself, but it didn't seem to be coming from anywhere, like maybe I was glowing.  I walked from the living room into the dining area, which had a large table and was set for seven. I heard a sound, like a child giggling and small footfalls coming from the doorway on the other side of the room.  "Hello?" I tried to shout loudly, but no sound came out. I ran through the doorway into the kitchen, and heard more footsteps sounding like they were going upstairs. I ran after the sound and came to the top of the steps. The door on my right was open slightly, and I could hear a child laughing and talking on the other side. I pushed it open slowly, and there sat my sister who I'd never known, playing with a pair of knitted dolls. She like she was about four years old, just like she'd looked in the pictures I'd seen of her.  She looked up at me as I walked in with a big, sweet smile and then held out one of the dolls for me to take. Jesus Christ, I got down on the floor in that dark, otherworldly house and played dolls with my dead sister.  Then the sound of a door opening and closing came from the bottom of the stairs. My sister looked sad. "You have to go," she said. "I hope you come back. I don't like it here. He's not nice."  I tried to ask her *who?* but still no sound came out. Heavy steps were coming steadily but slowly up the stairs.  The bedroom door opened, but all I could see on the other side was blackness, then a huge, bone-white hand shot out of the darkness, grabbed my whole head and pulled me through the door. I woke up in the lake again, able to hear something crashing through the brush on the banks. I dragged myself onto the shore, and heard a woman's shrill voice yelling "Oh thank God, you're alive. Are you okay?"  The woman's name is Nicole. She took me out of the lake and to her small house in the woods near the lake. I'm alive, and feeling better now, thanks to her. I don't know what to think anymore. Tomorrow, I'm leaving the state and going back to my old life. I think it's clear that what's going on here is beyond me. If any of you have any idea of what's going on here... please, help me.  I should never have come back home.  EDIT: Linked the story of why I don't swim in that paragraph.
