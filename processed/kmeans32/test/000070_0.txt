In case there is a pay wall,  The Senate joined the House by approving a session-ending bill Friday making adjustments to legislation imposing a state tax increase of $432 million next year that constitutes the largest in Kansas history.  Public begging and private bullying that defined the session's votes on tax policy prompted adoption by the bare minimum -- 21 votes in the Senate, 63 in the House -- of legislation  endorsed by Gov. Sam Brownback and designed to respond to a projected $400 million deficit in the fiscal year starting July 1.  The House came up with a slightly different mix of tax additions than was passed Sunday by the Senate, which required the upper chamber to vote on a bill matching the House action. That bill was in peril on Friday afternoon until Sen. Rob Olson, R-Olathe, changed his vote to "yes" and provided the ending margin.  In recent days, heavy political muscle was applied to GOP lawmakers to vote for a tax increase or face a primary election opponent in August 2016.  The Brownback administration also triggered a public backlash by declaring failure to raise taxes could result in sweeping budget reductions in Kansas higher education.  The battle to frame the tax increase in a politically palatable way erupted on the Senate and House floors.  "I view this as tax reform, not a tax hike," said Sen. Julia Lynn, an Olathe Republican who voted for the measure.  Sen. Jeff Longbine, R-Emporia, said the tax package was deficient in many ways but voted for the legislation because it might not improve if the session was prolonged. He denounced tactics used to persuade legislators to vote for revenue enhancements.  "We've had blackmail from the executive branch to the legislative branch," he said. "We've had blackmail within this body."  Brownback, in a meeting Thursday with Republicans in the House and Senate, said he was desperate to make a deal.  "I'm pleading with you, really," he said.  That GOP gathering helped inspire passage by the House of a two bills revising tax law, but likely requiring Brownback to take a knife to state spending in the next fiscal year. The chamber slipped over the hurdle around 4 a.m. Friday after hard-core conservatives who had stiff-armed leadership and the governor for weeks folded.  "Colleagues, weve had a long session, but our diligence has paid off and were making an additional $50 million in cuts to the budget," said Rep. Steve Brunk, R-Wichita. "Our goal is to enact a long-term stable and predictable revenue source to provide necessary services while protecting taxpayers pocketbooks. This bill accomplishes that.  Though dozens of Republicans ended up voting to raises taxes -- some in violation of anti-tax pledges -- some couldn't hide their displeasure.  Rep. John Whitmer, a Wichita Republican, spoke through tears as he explained his "yes" vote.  "I voted for something I am not proud of," Whitmer said, "but I feel it's what the folks need."  The legislation retained a business tax exemption Brownback delivered to 330,000 businesses in 2012, but raised the statewide sales tax to 6.5 percent from 6.15 percent on all purchases. A provision dropping the sales tax on food to 5.95  percent was withdrawn by Republicans who want to consider that adjustment in advance of the 2016 elections for House and Senate.  "It gives us the highest sales tax rate on food in the nation. Low-income people will be paying the highest rate in the nation," said Senate Minority Leader Anthony Hensley, D-Topeka. "Brownback's tax policy is Robin Hood in reverse. He steals from the poor to benefit the rich."  House Minority Leader Tom Burroughs, D-Kansas City, said Republicans were dedicated to adding $164 million to the sales tax, wiping out $97 million in itemized deductions and boosting the cigarette tax by $40 million.  "We are literally increasing the cost of living in Kansas on those who can afford it least," Burroughs said.  The plan would freeze state income tax rates at 2.7 percent and 4.6 percent through 2017, which saves the state $26  million. The deal also dropped language requiring all Kansas sales tax exemptions to expire in four years.  The session has consumed 113 days -- longest in state history and well beyond the standard 90-day session.  The break in House gridlock followed warnings by the Brownback administration that savage cuts would be made in the state university system and the state's bond ratings would collapse absent a compromise about Republicans.  Brownback and the GOP-controlled House and Senate struggled to respond to a budget deficit that trailed approval of the elimination of state income tax on limited liability companies and other businesses as well as the reduction of individual income tax rates. The bill contains a $24 million hit on these business entities, but the presumption is savvy accountants could help most owners avoid the hit.  The higher sales tax would be implemented July 1, but businesses wouldn't be obligated to assess that rate for 30 days. That could clip the state for one month of the projected revenue increase from the sales tax by $13 million.  The legislation also depends on the Kansas Department of Revenue pulling in $30 million this fall with a tax amnesty program for people who have dodge taxes.  The two bills now in play with the House and Senate would raise $384.6 million annually for the state, but a separate piece of legislation sent to Brownback would deliver $47.8 million from a new tax on managed care organizations in Kansas.

My English teacher during my senior year of high school was one of the coolest people I've known. He was open to ideas and encouraged creativity, no matter how crazy it might have seemed.   He only had one flaw, he would return papers weeks, if not even months, after they had been turned in. We wrote a long paper at the beginning of the second semester (January/February) and did not get them back until the night of graduation.  Ran in to him at a party a few years back. He had moved to the same college town to get his Masters. Found out that the reason it took him so long to return papers and have everything graded was due to the fact he had severe depression and teaching was the only thing that kept him going.  He's now married and has a wonderful life doing what he loves.

My health went to shit back in 2008 and I have had inner-ear problems since then. Over the course of several years I lost hope of ever feeling better and stopped doing most things I enjoyed. Now I'm substantially better because I know how to control the problem (took all but 5 years), but I'm afraid to return to what I once loved. I do not want to have to relearn something that once came to me naturally. I also can't run without feeling sick. Running always helped me relieve stress. It hasn't been an option for several years now.

Thank you! :-)

Unfortunately that wouldn't work. The container isn't the type where you can do that. For now, it's stored in a zip loc bag and should last me close to a month.
Forgot to include this part of the recipe:  http://i.imgur.com/uOnlkvw.jpg?1  Chose to make the Enchiladas Suizas over the regular recipes - - more cheese! :-)
Works when I click on it.   I know, but it's still ridiculous. Especially when they do this every term. This time they actually have a reasonable excuse.   Edit: more words
If you happen to have another cat, this breed tends to be territorial. Found this out after watching a few episodes of 'My Cat from Hell', and my mom just assumed it couldn't be fixed. Unforunately, it would have been an easy thing to do- had I only known at the time. She made me get rid of Bella after having her for only 2 years.  But..on to the good stuff:  Such a great breed, especially if you're in the mood for a playful, energetic and lovable kitty! Congrats!! :-D
Recipe calls for the use of a food processor or blender, for pureeing the mixture. After making this last night, changing to a blender cut down on prep time - thanks to the puree setting!
When dealing with blush, I either can't see it or it's too overpowering. Can't seem to find a brand that compliments my skin tone.   Eyeshadow is quite a bit different. As you can see, I have scaring above my left eye. More so, my entire eyelid consists of a skin graft. This makes applying eye makeup to be quite a challenge. Especially when I want to do something colorful and creative. Sorry, I should have made that problem more clear from the start.
Thank you so much for sharing! I will definitely try it sometime soon! Do you happen to know of a good recipe? If not, that's fine. Just thought I'd ask before searching! :-)
Tip:  Oh and only make what you plan to eat. Not as great when reheated.   Also, if you are wondering about the taste. I'm horrible at describing these things, but the main flavors are curry and garlic. If you're familiar with Middle Eastern food, you'll have a clearer idea of this. I had someone ask and figured other people might wonder the same.
I know it crossed my mind a time or two, but I rarely took it in to consideration. After meeting Dan Barker a few years back, I began to realize just how much of a problem this was. First off, we (the US) are not solely a 'Christian Nation' and symbolizing such a thing on US Currency only provides more problems. I'm not sure where to go from there because that should make it rather clear, but I would like to point out the fact that (former motto) 'E pluribus unum': One out of many - seemed just fine.
EXACTLY! Thanks for the reply! ^  Most (if not all) grocery stores (unless privately owned Co-Ops) receive all their produce from the same location. Hints why the UPC codes for produce do not change upon location! This makes express checkouts (self-checkouts) a great thing to use! (Also worked at Dillons in high school so I recall most of the codes....)  Meat providers possibly stay the same, that I do not know. In regards to dairy, well clearly Dillons/Kroger has a different private provider than WalMart - aside from the name-brands that appear in every store: i.e. Silk, Roberts, etc.
I just fail to understand the fuss about it, as long as you're in the comforts of your own home. Since it asked about 'married couples', I wanted to point out the fact you don't have to be married to feel comfortable around each other. I do my best not to 'toot' around him, but it's a natural process the body experiences. And hey, we've grown to laugh at the cost of what others would find grotesque and unappealing - in order to not take everything so seriously and to just relax and understand it's a part of life.   Taking a shit on your from lawn isn't the same. That clearly includes the public and violation of law.
people have got to work this out for themselves  They live a way of life where incidents like this are 'culturally acceptable'. By knowing that, there's little we can do and if people within the area try to speak up - we know very well what would happen to them. We've seen it on the news recently.   Citizens are denied to right to speak up against such things and sadly, we can only wish for it to stop.
I reformatted the post to make it easier to read and to highlight key points. If anyone has a question/comment, please do not hesitate to post. It would provide insight as to whether 1) people noticed this too, 2) if the reddit community finds this interesting, and 3) if it is even relevant.
I appreciate your posting of this, but the 2nd to last paragraph clearly makes the article pointless to read. It states:  Despite the efforts of the humble earthworm, the vast majority of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere - which is responsible for 60% of the total warming from greenhouse gases - is caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. ---------------- But earthworms only account for about 16% of greenhouse gases. How's that a concern? Worms have existed for millennia, but we (humans) haven't.  I understand their intention, but it doesn't seem to account for much. Especially when compared to human interventions.
