You just need to update your post to say that you are a parent   that was teeth gritting. like i said, "i don't want the average redditor to know the personal details of my life". i don't think i'll choose to participate. "we" as moderators sometimes are caught in between a hard place and a rock when upholding the rules of the subs we govern and i understand this and this is just one of those very rare times. thank you for your time and have a good weekend.

/r/ImaginaryMindscapes - The Art of Imagination.   source: http://www.artstation.com/artist/sarmati   Some words from the artist regarding this piece:  Rusaka is a slavic female demon usually appearing around lakes, ponds or rivers. She deceives men and drowns them. I wanted to show her as a dead corpse that uses a charm, so that she looks like a pretty woman when out of the water.  I've had some voices wondering about the swastikas on the rims of the guys shirt. So to make it clear. I have no connotations with any extreme right wing parties nor do I keep any nazi or racist oriented beliefs. Swastika has been used for hundreds of years in Poland, before Hitler stole it and spoilt it for everyone. The action of the image takes place in 9th or 10th century. If you want to know more about swastikas just wiki it. There is a really broad and interesting article written about it.

A heavy machine gun, possibly a Japanese Type 92 Heavy Machine Gun, lies abandoned in a bunker overlooking the landing beaches. There are still dozens of these bunkers all over the island. Most of them were destroyed during the battle. This pillbox still bore the scars of the fighting. It was pockmarked with bullet holes and the inside was blackened. I imagine a flame thrower was used to clear that pillbox.  source: http://www.panoramio.com/photo/2539738
