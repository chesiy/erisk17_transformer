Elizabeth Warren Nails GOP Financial Executive
this is a little excessive, but I think the point that u/MrFactualReality is trying to make is that Bernie has stood by his policies for his entire career. He marched on Washington with MLK, he has fought for LGBT rights since the seventies, he was/is against the Iraq War, he is against TPP. Sanders stands by his views and does not flip-flop. I think Hillary with TPP is what definitely sold me on Bernie, she took awhile to respond to it (and still has not?), while Bernie came out against it since the whole debate started. I also see her more as a moderate than Bernie, which is why Bernie appeals to me more, as I am more of a progressive. One last point, the whole 2 billion dollar fundraising goal by Hillary is not something I am a fan of. I think these are the points that u/MrFactualReality was trying to make, but was taking a much more rash stance against her.
black glove Ray is the best.
I agree with this claim, from personal experience. I could not go to my top school I wanted to due to cost. The school I wanted to go to was higher ranked and had tougher admission standards than the school I am attending now. Yes I was still able to go a university, but the cost was why I chose a university with lower admission standards and a lower academic rating.

I was thinking the same thing, that the blood looked like it was kind of fresh. If you watch on the second time he is shot you can see the blood and it doesn't look like the blood had been soaked into the floor yet.
