Oh I couldn't care less that he did it. Just takes away from him being the most ND player possible.
And even, for example, The Other Guys was a pretty smart movie. I mean, yes, it was a comedy, but it was also a pretty well done take on Madoff and other Ponzis.
You also have to take into account costs. 10% is going to your agent. 50% is going to taxes. You also have extra medical and nutritional costs the average person won't. And those medical costs especially are probably going to continue for the rest of your life.
I've never seen as many dirty blocks by one team as I have by the Niumatalolo led Navy teams. And I understand how the academies have to play, I don't have anything against that. It makes me prefer we didn't play them, but I don't hold it against them. My issue is that it seems like every year there's at least 1-2 plays like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcTaRThg2mQ).
They also need to stop asking questions like "Did you resolve to catch 'em all?" when clearly everyone will respond with "I can't, put out bank"
No one in the media should be calling out college kids. Just not classy. Professional athletes are paid and it comes with the gig, college athletes aren't. And if anyone shouldn't, it's Doug Gottlieb about anyone at Notre Dame.
One of the things KLM said that I feel needs to be clarified is that Tommy wasn't getting booed last year when he came into games. There were boos, yes, but those were at Kelly, for what was perceived as giving up on Golson. We'd just seen Dayne Crist removed after a half the year before, we wanted Kelly to give someone else a shot. Tommy Rees for the last 2 years felt like a crutch for Kelly. A nice safe QB that can get 7-9 wins on a decent team. Those aren't the seasons we play for though. As a student body, at least, there's been nothing but respect for Tommy Rees. Do people wish we had a better QB, absolutely, but that doesn't take away anything that he accomplishes. He's part of the ND family, and nothing's going to change that.
Just don't forget about it.
Tie between two people. One would be Chris Stevens. Grew up in foster homes. Ends up being good enough at basketball to get a scholarship to Notre Dame. Plays on the team that stops UCLA's 88 game win streak. After school goes to play in Europe for a year before working for Proctor and Gamble and then running a Budweiser distributor. Finally gets tired of that and helps to found Keurig. After having done that for a while he's retired now and just funds interesting projects and is now teaching at Notre Dame.  The other would be Alasdair MacIntyre.  He's one of the most highly regarded philosophers in the world and incredibly interesting to listen to.
Yeah I understood the point which was they did better in low scoring games, but it came across that way.
About 8 years ago we used to have a commercial for a car place whose tag line was "If the tranny is dead, just call Fred." I always used to think it sounded like it should be a slogan for a really shady law firm, a la Saul Goodman.
So then who's the Tecmo Super Bo?
And of course the flattery of calling her a 7.
I think it's hilarious. I've been waiting for something to come out because I knew he wasn't actually dating her. He was dating someone else at the time. He even just called her a friend early on I believe. This probably led to less shock when it all came out. Though I'd never have guessed she didn't exist. I'm pretty sure he was in on it to some degree due to rumblings I've heard, but to what I'm not sure.  As for ND fans in general, the student body seems to be pretty skeptical of him, the rest of the fan base who doesn't know him as well is pretty much buying his story entirely.
Hell I think it's hilarious. I've been waiting for something to come out about this whole thing for months. I knew he wasn't actually dating her, never would have guessed she wasn't a person.
Token ND student here. That never was a question because he was hitting on girls. He was dating someone when the story came out from everything I've heard. We all thought the original story was weird.
