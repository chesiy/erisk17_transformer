Stephan Dedalus from A portrait Of The Artist. May seem a masturbatory answer (oddly fitting due to the nature of the book). Just because I grew up very religious and very conflicted about my thoughts, feelings and desires. Not understanding the world. The joy and terror of being a bad person in your own eyes. Rejecting your previous beliefs once you become an adult. Deciding to pursue writing.
I like the concept and it's quite well written. I really enjoy the final line. I think it might be more effective if you placed the platitudes in bold. Or I guess you could just preface the preface the piece with an explanation. I think the piece could be more humorous and effective in other, less form heavy writing styles. Overall I think you did well!

I think 14 is a good age to read that book. Its around those years which you begin to consider the depths of morality. I found the book enthralling and I still enjoy it. Though I read The Great Gatsby  at 18, and all though I found it to be well written, the themes and messages were things I had already considered through other media. Of course this shows the impact of the novel on society, I'm just saying that some of those novels written in a different time or place are more significant at younger ages.
