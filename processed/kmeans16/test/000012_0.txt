"is your refrigerator running?"  "As you can clearly see, I don't have a cartoon fridge so it would not be, SHUT UP LISA I'M ON THE PHONE. JUST CHANGE INTO YOUR SEXY CLOTHES AND I'LL BE THERE... Sorry about that. You know how daughters are."
Is good to see another fan of skyward sword. It was my favorite Zelda game before Majora's Mask 3D came out. I'm very sad that I do not play it more often. I have to share a screen with a family, so my  3DS has been filing the roll of main Console.  Feel free to hit me up if you'd ever like to discuss the game. And, I think there is a position to increase your overall stamina. There are a few ocarina cheat codes that I deal make the game more enjoyable with actually cheating at anything.
I have a good bulk of what you're looking to buy. I had a Cyber Dragon deck I used to play. I took out some of the more common cards to use in another deck, so I can sell you what I have at a price that's more than reasonable. Finances are forcing me to take a hiatus, so let's make a deal. PM me if you're interested and I'll get you a list and pics of what I have.
"Hi, my name is Colin Mochrie, and I'm making this online profile to meet girls."
"Introducing Tyler Perry's..." *rips up paper* "Let's be honest. It doesn't matter what we put here. It's gonna suck."
"And if you look past *It's a Mauled World*, you'll find the *bladderhorn*."
"I'm a let y'all finish, but Beyonc is one of the best peeps of all time."  "GET OFF THE STATE KENYE"
There is one more unforgivable curse. Some girls here may remember their daddy using it on them when they were young. There's no way to undo it. There's no such thing as being a virgin again.
I got my girlfriend a preorder of that the year it was announced. I guess I'm better! Lol. That's great for you. It's a good read. Hope you enjoy.
It's hard to feel like we can help you. When you're in danger, you may want to leave out extraneous details. Like "It had rotted *from being in the heat from a metal box*". It had rotted would have sufficed. Also, Nan's personal information was a bit much. It's like you're writing down everything that happens to you because you want us to feel it as vividly as you did.  I feel like this update and the read in general could have been a lot shorter and clearer. With so many details, it's hard to think of any helpful advice.
I think we should all stop being skeptical. One of the fun parts of Skyward Sword was that environment was turned into a puzzle. This looks like it can bring similar yet more subtle experience. It's taking a part of Metroid's formula of turning the simplicity of point A to Point B into something that you need to figure out. Plus, a world this eerily detailed has the potential to hide the most subtle secrets for small but rewarding returns (unlike Skyrim where you might do a whole dungeon for a small amount of gold and a dirt cheap potion).  Plus, I bet, that this world to turn out just as beautiful if not more beautiful as anything Bethesda has tried to do. And they likely didn't put nearly as much effort into just making sure every object's every last wrinkle can be seen.
"I can get it for five dollars at Franks".   -ultra rare breakthrough skill.  "sorry, it's getting hit for sure,".   -Evils warm Option  "that's not for trade ".   -a card they really should not put in their binder if they are not trading it  "you have any (insert card I have)".   -"oh, I'm sorry, I'm only looking for the ultimate rare"  "yugioh prices is always wrong".   -their other site's prove ends up benefiting me instead of him, so I just let it go.  Just to elaborate, I was willing to value my exciting at 20. Based on yugioh prices. He saw 30 dollars for the same exciton and offered me 25 for it. I took his offer.  Also, please fucking learn how to use Yugioh Prices. It checks everything at once for you. If a value seems unusual, click on the fucking listing and verify it.
Yes it is. It was pretty much doomed to be that way. This is the first mobile OS apple made that allowed apps to talk to each other and use each other. Not to mention, they just added so darn much to the inner workings of this thing. And it pretty much supported more devices than any iOS before it. Especially all of the features that are dependent on communication with other apps and/or devices.  Yeah, I'm a little down that safari crashes more often that it used to (not like I should be browsing that much on my phone anyway). I'm also a little bummed that airplay or airdrop simply don't see other devices with these enabled sometimes. Such a shame. I'm also disappointed that the wifi simply cuts out sometimes in places where it didn't before iOS 8.  Nevertheless, the least we can do to help is go to Apple's feedback page and leave feeedback. Don't sit here complaining fruitlessly if you have an issue. Report everything to Apple. They need to hear the same complaints over and over from different users so they know that each issue IS an actual issue.

Looking for a post that appears to be taken off   It was recent. It was called "Why it is important that the winner is who it is".  I wanted to read it but wanted to see the matches first and now it looks like I am too late. Anybody know what it said?
