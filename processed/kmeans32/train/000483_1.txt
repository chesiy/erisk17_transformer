I'm currently still working on the first chapter, but I am posting it on fanfiction.net, which I think is the most populated fanfiction site, so it should get a lot of reviews and whatnot.   andnbsp;  My mom wants to get me into a writers workshop or something, I'm not to thrilled about it because I have poor social skills but I think I might just do it because I've never really pursued anything I've loved to a full extent before.
Damn, and I just posted something that mentions that I've lost interest in my religion. Hopefully I don't get flooded with PM's cuz in my current state of emotion... i guess you could call it, I don't really need that in my life.
It's a shame they wasted huge villains like Komodo and Count Vertigo in a matter of one episode.  EDIT: and Brick.
Clearly it's the dude says these beautiful quotes (DIGGLE!!!!):   * "Damnit Oliver, you would've been dead ten times over if it wasn't for me" * "I guess from now on, I'll be watching you pee" * "My secret identity is his black driver" * "You know, Oliver, somebody once told me that secrets have weight. The more you keep, the harder it is to keep moving." * "Felicity, I don't think there's a force on earth that can make you a bad person." * "Things are as good now as ever will be Oliver. And you love her. You even told her so." ... (Oliver: "I was trying to fool Slade.") ... "Yes, except now the only person you're fooling is yourself."  **Currently my favourite Diggle Quote**:  * " I don't know. For the first time since I met Oliver Queen I don't know what happens next. I know it's silly, but I still like to think of myself as Oliver's bodyguard. I just couldn't protect him. It's funny. He was worried something would happen to me."  ___  andnbsp;  There are many more, but I'll leave it at that.
Who is the guy on the right? Looks like a mix of Pied Piper or Cpt. Cold or something, but I know it's not them.
Because he's joking about how similar Green Arrow is to Batman.  andnbsp;  Unfortunately, he doesn't know that they share villains.  * Merlyn (Green Arrow villain) * Deathstroke (Green Arrow/Batman/Teen Titans villain * The Huntress (Anti-hero, not a villain really of Green Arrow, but brought into the story because.... Black Canary, Birds of Prey, etc. * Brother Blood (Not even a Batman villain, Teen Titans villain.) * Brick (Green Arrow Villain) * Cyrus Gold (Solomon Grundy pre-zombie, is a Green Arrow villain post-crisis) * Deadshot (Not specifically a Green Arrow villain, but has faced him in Animated TV Shows, and his daughter lives in Star City) * Ra's Al Ghul (Not specifically a Green Arrow villain, but Merlyn is affiliated with the League of Assassins, so it was fine to introduce him into Arrow... in fact if it wasn't for Merlyn, the League would probably never have been involved with the story, except some snippets of Sara Lance here and there.) * The Clock King (Green Arrow villain.) * Cupid (Green Arrow Villain.) * Brother Eye (More of a JLA villain... which Green Arrow is a part of.) * Count Vertigo (Green Arrow and Batman shared villain.) * Firefly (Batman villain.) * KGBeast (Not a villain.... yet. But a Batman villain.) * Dollmaker (Batman Villain.)  ___  andnbsp;  Consensus: The only true Batman-exclusive villains on Arrow are Firefly, Dollmaker, and Deadshot, we have yet to see Anatoli Knyazev's story, assuming they'll cover the whole Russian Bratva thing in the flashbacks.
Don't forget the motto.  andnbsp;  Not God...Grodd.
Correction:   andnbsp;  *Lifts Vibrating Hand*   Do you know how hard it has been to keep all of this from you, especially from you? Because the truth is, I've grown quite fond of you. And in many ways, you have shown me what it's like to have a son.   andnbsp;  *"it" happens*  andnbsp;  Forgive me, but to me, you've been dead for centuries.
me too haha.
[Full Series Spoilers] I find it hard to imagine Arrow only running for 5 seasons.   First off, we know that H.I.V.E., Damien Darhk, and some more Diggle stuff will be covered in Season 4. But lets look at all of the things they haven't covered.    (Feel free to give me more things to add to this list in the comments below.)  andnbsp;  * There's no way the China White (Chien Na Wei) story is over * We've barely seen Komodo * We haven't seen Onomatopoeia * Slade Wilson and Digger Harkness were former ASIS members and are both imprisoned on Lian Yu... coincidence? * More Katana? * If Oliver meets Hal Jordan or anyone else in Coast City in Season 4, I don't think their relationship will only last 1 season * Oliver's child * Merlyn Al Ghul :o * Though I doubt they'll show this, Lyla Michaels has powers in the comics. * What if they finally get Blue Beetle on here * More Diggle/Felicity villains * I hope to see more Brick * I can't believe they kinda threw this character away but hopefully there's some way to bring him back, Constantine Drakon * Jake Simmons/Deathbolt was in Opal City when the particle accelerator went off (Probably will be covered in The Flash though) * Roy Harper, what's gonna happen with him, will he ever be able to come back to Starling City * Starling City officially becoming Star City? * Sara is back, Quentin Lance reaction to that? * Cyrus Gold.... Solomon Grundy? o_o * The Huntress ?  ___  Okay, that's all I've got for now  ___  **EDIT:** More uncovered things:  * Russian mafia flashbacks * Raisa, the maid from Season 1. * Thea meeting Barry.
Writing an Arrow/Flash fanfiction on Wattpad that probably won't get any recognition due to the millions of stories about One Direction by 14 year old girls. I just got ganked by the whole team in top lane of League of Legends, I was playing Shen, then my team forfeited.  andnbsp;  I might also watch Constantine, sad it got cancelled, I'll see how good it was.
I didn't like the special effects until the ending fight scene with the heat vision... that was nice.
Ted Grant is still alive.
[Small Arrow S1EP4 Spoiler] Could The Arrow Prove Henry Allen is innocent?   He did it in Season 1 Episode 4 with Peter Declan, he's already fought against Mirakuru on the island, and God knows what in the 2 last years of his time away from Starling City, could he, prove Harrison Wells as the killer? Or even find out Harrison Wells' true identity?
DIGGLE!!!!
I'm hoping that maybe Roy Harper is pulling a Malcolm Merlyn. Maybe sometime in Season 5, the police agree with The Green Arrow and they get the news that Roy Harper faked his death and he's welcomed back to the probably renamed 'Star City' by Ray Palmer.   Also, my thoughts for main villains to prolong the series.  Season 4 - Damien Darhk  Season 5 - More H.I.V.E. stuff/Return of Deadshot  Season 6 - Deathstroke back(will appear in both previous seasons in smaller roles)  Season 7 - Merlyn  Season 8 - Chien Na Wei   andnbsp;  idk just a dream :3
UPVOTE PARTY -- LIL B HIT 1MILLION TWITTER FOLLOWERS!!!!!
Prove to me that karma isn't a b***h (UPVOTE!!)
Rules...or whatever.   Post things that are just downright sad, that make you "cri evrytiem".   Examples of "cri evrytiem" moments are:    * Studying all night for a test, only to fail * Dying on your last life in a video game  You get the point.   The Term "cri evrytiem" is commonly used in YouTube video when   someone dies or fails. YouTubers usually will add a caption stating   "Liek dis if u cri evrytiem".   Rules are as follows:   * Any off topic posts will be deleted Yea....that's pretty much it.

Lance was amazing, i do miss him, atleast he's the same old Lance we all love :D http://i.imgur.com/rQgd6wg.gif
When more celebrity nudes leak...
I remember commented on a Lakers post about Julius Randle. As a Pacers fan, I understand what it feels to have multiple players injured (george, west, hill, watson).  But if you saw how Roy Hibbert played (22pts 8reb 7blk), i can guarantee you, someone will step up, whether it be Ibaka, or like you said Perry Jones, someone will. I'm sorry for your lost, and  I don't really understand how bad it might feel, playing in a strong West Conf. But nevertheless, I wish you guys the best on your season.
Kobe Bryant - The Final Chapter Starts Here...
Paul George can now put weight on leg, back to doing upper body work in gym
U got Kik?
Unfortunately, The Knicks and Kings have a much better chance of getting Rondo, if we trade anyone, we're done. Let's see how Hibbert and West lead the team this year. Maybe Stuckey can put up big numbers, his stats when he got starter minutes were just slightly worse than D-Wade this season. Let's hope Solomon Hill is a decent player. Lastly, let's hope Solomon Hill doesn't become the most improved player and Larry Bird does something stupid like trade PG, like they did with Granger, and let's hope they don't trade Hibbert for Monroe, cuz Monroe is only gonna demand a huge contract or leave in free agency.
idk if firstrowsports.eu has fiba, but u can try
:) i made it, glad u enjoyed it, im a pacers fan, but i cant wait to see what he can do.

Hi, I don't know if people are still looking at this. But....without further ado..  My name is Tim, I posted gaming videos, sometimes Chatroulette trolling, and occasionally a tutorial.   I do have a capture card for PS3 gaming, but I need to buy HDMI Cables and PS3 HD/AV Component cables  I'm only 15, and I've had a YouTube account since I was 9 lol, but this channel isn't the one from 2007, I made this to start a new chapter in life.  I struggle with depression and anxiety like many teens but I'm also very socially awkward so YouTube is my way to escape from reality, somewhat.  I don't really like posting just gameplay, I like to discuss thing, I'm just not a vLog person so, I commentate over gameplay.  I hope you enjoy my content and subscribe. Remember it's not an obligation, only subscribe if you like it.  www.youtube.com/user/MrEXGamingTV
