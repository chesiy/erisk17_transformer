Lots of people are missing the point. Yes Sainz is more consistent and quicker in qualifying, but he hasn't raised my heartbeat once so far this season. Max just is an exciting driver to watch. That's what this article is about.  The No.1 complaint is that f1 is getting boring, more exciting drivers means less boring races.
It's just a joke, calm down mate.
Hey im running the 1/2 marathon too this year, first ever race. What is your target time?
Relax, wash, sit.

Aaand save
I normally get 4 in early-midgame PvT, cutting that bio in half on ramps an chokepoints in awesome, later often only 2 because i wont use them anyway. (only pop GS before storming and so on) in PvP most of the time 2, mostly for GS as well in every fight. In PvZ i get about 4-8, dependig on my own and mostly the strat of my opponent. But the best thing about sentries is: scout every 1.5 - 2 mins for bases, tech changes, army comp and so on with hallu phoenix, in every matchup!
Really loving all the subtle things in this season so far, the zealot in the dish, the cheese throwing, the balance joking (reaper changes, super long range on nexus cannon) Just gives it that little extra!
I think Huk and Ret aren't talking about the same thing, huk complains about him getting denied to compete in both code A and WCS NA/EU while players in code S are allowed to do this, Ret is giving his opinion about koreans playing in WCS NA/EU in the first place. 2 very different things
you a pretty dirty window.
Ja hoor jongens, weer iets om trots op te zijn!
AHWWWW man, I LOVE SC2!!!
This is from quite a while ago, and it is embarrasing to watch for me now, but i think this was the closest game in my still short SC2 career, hope you like it (:
