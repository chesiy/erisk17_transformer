Oh no
Don't fuck it UP, CHUCK!
It is nice to be able to message on my keyboard vs. typing on my phone.    In case the developer is lurking, there are a few enhancements that would make this extension even better:  * When a message is received, have the Tab head flash * The ability to sort your matches by current distance  * The ability to sort your matches by last active * The ability to see how many of your moments a person has liked.

Thats pretty awesome!  It would be cool if there was a site that had all the FBS stadiums broken down like that (when possible).  But that would be A LOT of work, for such little payoff.

Because its been going on for over 20 years. That means there have been....  * Five chancellors (The top person) * Two Athletic Directors (Includes John Swofford, the current ACC Commissioner)  * Four Head Men's Basketball coaches (Includes Dean Smith) * Five Head Football coaches (Includes Mack Brown)  That doesn't include all the other minions needed for something this large.  This wasn't isolated.  But it would be difficult to get a cancer this large in any other school.
Scroll down to **PANTHERS=NEWTON, NEWTON=PANTHERS**.  He had those remarks before the Packers game.  How big of an effect did the OT tie have on not doing well this week?   Cinci was SHUTOUT vs. the Colts.  After avg. 26.8pt a game.
Here is the (SUPER SHORT) AP article: http://bigstory.ap.org/article/52b272b6c402432885d29c9411c0a49f/un-health-agency-officially-declares-end-ebola-outbreak  But I assume it will be updated when more info is known.
I won't read it again.  Luckily, no one else will either.  But congrats!
you guys still gave up 41 points  Might wanna look at the play-by-play, before making a general statement like that.    Their first TD came from a trick play. They did a Wide receiver pass to get the points. That occurred with 9:51 left in the FIRST  http://www.tarheeltimes.com/article59839.aspx  Second TD came on a 4th down   5 trick play.  Their punter threw a pass for a TD.  That was 14:47 in the Second.   They got two more TDs in the 4th quarter.  But it was already 56-27 at the start.  So they got 14pts off of trick plays and 14pts in garbage 4Q time.  Yes they count as much as legit TDs, but the defense only gave up 13 other points.

**RMS Lusitania** was a British ocean liner, that left New York for Liverpool on what would be her final voyage on 1 May 1915 (the day of this article).   The sinking and deaths of 1,198 passengers and crew help bring the United States into World War I, which officially started today (July 28, 1914).  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Lusitania
I almost had this happen to me.  I had some random very specific question about Word, and couldn't find anything online.  So I called my university's IT support and asked them.  They had no idea, but gave me a number to Microsoft Office tech.  Called that number, everything seemed fine at first.  He remotely logged into my computer via Logmein. But "bells" started going off and he said I had a virus on my computer etc etc, but he could fix it.  At that point, I realized it wasn't Microsoft and I let some random person into my computer.  I shut down that conversation and ran a bunch of scans. I also spoke to the "higher level" IT people at my university and they ran stuff as well.  It sounded like a Scare scam to them.  They seemed to have gotten an old Microsoft phone number, but websites still has MS as the listed business.  Learned me a big lesson.
Oh I get it.....it is cause he is fat.  It would be clever to come up with a non-fat punchline.

Parachuting into Denver Bronco's Stadium for the AFC Championship Game - UNEDITED
Does anyone else see this new conference the beginning of another schism in the Division 1 world?   The NCAA first had a University Division and College Division. The University Division became Division I and the College Division became Division II and III, in 1973.  In 1978 Division 1 divided into Division 1A (Football Bowl Subdivision) and IAA (Football Championship Subdivision).    So each break made the club more exclusive.  Now we have the AQ conferences that at one time was 66 of the 120 schools in FBS (I haven't counted all of the new schools).  So are we going to a point where we will have an NCAA FBS "AQ" National Champ and NCAA FBS "non-AQ" National Champ, along with the FCS champs?  Let's face it, no team outside of the current AQs or the merged conference are ever going to win consistently.    Or am I just talking out of my ass?
Is there any "damage" as a result from a 1yr use of Melatonin?
So I am a mid-20 year old male who was recently diagnosed with ADHD-NOS   And today was the first day I took my prescription of Adderall (10mg).  What are some things I should look for or know etc?  The only thing I felt today was a warm feeling for a little while.  I read about the abuse (they have to give a pamphlet on it).  I am not worried about that.    So any hints, tricks, or whatever I should know or look out for?
