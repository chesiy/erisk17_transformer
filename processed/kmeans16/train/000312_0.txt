I know, unfortunately the GOP has run a successful union busting ring here for the past 50 years. The regional airlines here are separate companies that use non union pilots and are contracted out by the big 3 airlines (Delta, United, and American) to fly smaller planes ([40 to 80 seat planes like this](http://www.flugzeuginfo.net/acimages/crj700er_kp.jpg)) from their hubs to small cities, think Chicago to Green Bay. They are staffed by pilots just out of flight school so they are desperate to get their "dream job" and go to work for regional airlines because the larger ones won't hire you out of flight school. The regional airlines know that they don't have to pay a high salary because there are plenty of eager pilots in line to get a job. In a perfect world you spend a few years flying for a regional airline then get hired by the Delta's, United's, Southwest's and JetBlue's of the world. But that doesn't always happen.
The christian right has lost: Same-Sex Marriage Legal Nationwide, Supreme Court Rules
It doesn't need to be banned. It just shouldn't be flown on the lawn of the South Carolina legislature. There is too much baggage associated with the flag. If you think it's "southern pride" then fly it on your own property. That flag was flown by traitors who rebelled against the US government. No state should embrace that flag   [(this applies to Mississippi as well)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Mississippi)  Note: Born and raised in Georgia and always associated that flag with racism.   edit: spelling and grammar.
Exactly, I'm the one that posted the original source http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/36xa1f/legislators_and_corporate_lobbyists_sponsored_by/   It made me mad that it didn't get more recognition. I don't give a damn about the karma, I just wanted the story (the original story is much better IMO) out there.
Also the charges against the person he beat up have been dropped. [The officer was accused of planting cocaine in the mans car](http://www.clickondetroit.com/news/violent-inkster-arrest-did-officer-plant-evidence/32014270)
You say in /r/logcabinrepublicans that you were an active part in /r/conservative. That right there made me lose any respect that I had for you. You can certainly have views about fiscal policy and what not but that place is a hell hole of racist homophobic conspiratory right wing fundamentalist shit. The fact of the matter is that the republican party HATES us and our existence. Look at their presidential candidates. Everyone of them is against LGBT rights and supported the Indiana law
If I can't find the damn thing how can I make my point. Also I guarantee you haven't read the thing either since the thing is impossible to find online. It's almost like the state of Indiana doesn't want the public to see it. If they didn't want discrimination all Indiana had to do was be like other states and add a provision into the law saying that no one could use this law to discriminate against other people. That fact tell me right there that your politicians don't care about "religious liberty" but are instead a bunch of homophobic bigots. Also the fact that they made this law now after gay marriage became legal says a lot, if this was so important they could have done this 10 years ago when being a bigot was in-vogue. And no one who didn't support this bill would be defending it as hard as you have been on this thread.
Russia is a generally irrelevant country, so they are posturing to make themselves relevant, like Middle Eastern terrorists.  I'd say they are acting more like North Korea.
I have a few of the season on DVD and while Seinfeld is a hilarious show I don't think if lends itself to binge watching. When you watch the episodes back to back you realize just how ludicrous the show is and how unlikeable/ridiculous the characters are. Many would say "that's the brilliance/joke/point of the show". While this is true I honestly believe that it's best in small doses, otherwise it gets tiring.
why its bad   It allows people to use their religion to challenge or opt out of various laws - including local laws in Atlanta and other cities - that protect LGBT people and other minorities from discrimination in employment, housing, and public accommodations. In practical terms, S.B. 129 could allow businesses to refuse service to same-sex couples, a paramedic to refuse to provide life-saving services to an LGBT person, or a school counselor to refuse services to an LGBT teenager. The bill puts minority groups at risk of being denied service everywhere from the convenience store to the doctors office.

Best quote from the article: Asked if he believes a transgender woman is a woman, Artiles said, I am not going to get into that. I have not spent much time thinking about that.  So clearly, he is the foremost authority to author a bill specifically about that subject
I'll wear the hate with honor, I can be /u/EmperorofOrange and you can be /u/wake_is_great. I'll poke you when ever I'm bored
I honestly think that at this point he is secretly gay, how else do you explain a man so hell bent on stopping gay marriage?
Maybe so but at least Always did it of their own accord and aren't doing it because of a PR disaster ^cough NFL NOmore.org ^cough and the Always also came across more natural and sincere than the NOmore ads which again are nothing but PR. But people see things differently so I can see where you are coming from

We may be amongst the last now, but when the supreme court rules we hopefully won't have a gay marriage ban. Think of it like the sodomy laws. Georgia's was overturned by the state supreme court about 6 years before the supreme court overturned it nationally (though the Georgia case didn't involve a gay couple). Even though we were amongst the last we weren't THE last.
