NYC Legal Stabilized rent when hidden from landlord   Hi All, looking for some advice on the following situation:  Landlord never informed me that my building is rent stabilized. No preferential or legal rent was mentioned on the lease. No rider was attached.  I've been paying 1450 for just under the last 2 years. After a year the lease expired and went month-to-month. It was never renewed as is legally required.   Landlord now wants to raise rent $50. If this is still preferential obviously I don't want to cause trouble. If it isn't it could be too much of an increase, but I don't know the legal rent. I told him I need a new lease, but at the moment he still doesn't know that I know that the apt is rent stabilized.   What's the best course of action for me? Should I sign a lease for the additional $50 and then once I get the rent history from the state confront him if it is too much. Or should I wait until I get the history and then have him rewrite the lease if the increase is illegal?
you should know Turkish! Seriously... Way too many expats leading isolated lives in Turkey. You can't "learn how to bargain" unless you speak Turkish. If you start in English you've lost the game already.

haha I literally just did a film with the exact same perspective shift. Design aside, build the effects chain for your "deaf effect" and put it on an aux channel that returns to your main output. Then insert a send on any of your tracks that you want to morph into deafness, bussed to your new aux channel. Set it to "prefade" then you can fade down the main volume of the track, but fade up the aux send to reroute it through your effect.
Sure why not you just need an amp. All that said, these speakers aren't really going to give you a clear mix if you're doing serious audio work up close. They're more geared towards loud playback in a large entertainment venue, not precision.   Your signal chain would be:  Computer--firewire/usb--interface--very small mixing board*--2 channel amplifier--speakers  *like a Mackie 402VLZ4. Technically your interface could function also as your mixer but it's probably safer to have a mixer in there to gain stage everything correctly
Fish sauce and shallots.

Two ways I like:  * Cut in half, where the pit was drizzle some nice olive oil and handsomely season with S\P.  * When I have a little more time, I love to caramelize some shallots with cumin, paprika, lime juice. Throw in some almonds at the end. Put it in a bowl, and make some toast in the same pan. Then I take an avocado, mush it up, add salt, pepper, olive oil and a little bit of balsamic or rice-wine vinegar. Spread that on the toast, and add the shallot\almond on top.
How to *really* end a concert...
Native Brooklynite here. Use [HopStop](http://www.hopstop.com) to figure out trains once you know your destination.   I would suggest either walking across the Brooklyn bridge to DUMBO or you could take the F to York or the A\C to High St. Walk around [Dumbo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DUMBO) and then go up the hill (or squibb bridge) to [Brooklyn Heights](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Heights) to see some really nice tree lined brownstoney streets and the [Promenade](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Heights_Promenade).   Some alternatives: Walk the length of **5th Ave in Park Slope.** You could either take any train to Barclay's Center or 2/3 to Bergen.  Cool things to check out there:  * [BierKraft](http://www.bierkraft.com/)  * [Skyice](http://www.yelp.com/biz/skyice-sweet-and-savory-brooklyn) good Thai food that's a bit better than standard fare. Casual. Really interesting icecream flavors  * [Gorilla Coffee](http://gorillacoffee.com/) Strong Stuff!  * [Barbs](http://www.barbesbrooklyn.com) Amazing music every night of the year.   * etc...    Or take the B\Q all the way out to **Brighton Beach.** Get lunch at [Cafe Kashkar](http://kashkarcafe.com/) or one of the [Russian places](http://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Brighton+Beach+Russian+Restaurants find_loc=Brooklyn%2C+NY)  and then walk down the boardwalk to Coney Island which is erie but kinda cool in the winter. Good if you're adventurous and like Russian stuff.   Don't goto Williamsburg. It's just an extension of Manhattan and full of people trying too hard to act like what they think of as "real New Yorkers"
* **The Staten Island Ferry** You don't need tickets, don't worry about it.   * **Ground Zero** No idea, but I'm sure you can just show up.   * **City pass....** I'm a native New Yorker and never heard of this. The MET is free and you can give them whatever you want at entry so a "discount" seems silly.    * **Subway** Get a weekly pass. That makes sense since you'll be jetting around all week. Every station has a machine where you can get one.   * **Tickets** Goto TKTS. Like u/SilverMarch said the one in Downtown Brooklyn is the easiest. From there you can easily walk and see the Brooklyn Heights promenade\DUMBO\Brooklyn Bridge   * **Central Park** Like anywhere in New York, **the best thing you can do is just walk around, get lost and find your own little surprises**. The horses are pricy but easy to find.   * **Bus Tour** No clue. Be a real New Yorker and walk!   * **The Projects** Don't be an idiot.
Also check the places across the street from Sahadi's or Damascus next door for middle eastern goods.

agree that it's mastic. Try [making a pudding](http://ozlemsturkishtable.com/2012/09/milk-pudding-with-mastic-gum-and-rhubarb-compote/ ) from it instead of making Turkish Karanmaras dodurmasi as others have suggested which, at least when I've tried it in Turkey, doesn't really have much mastic flavor. oh and also Sahadi's is the best!
ramen?
Sorry I misspoke, I was referring to a putty knife not an offset spatula. Great for omelets, anything on a skillet, cleaning your cutting  board. I'm not professional but recently I've noticed one in every single professional kitchen I've peeked in. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Putty_knife

I've travelled to the furthest reaches of [Svaneti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svaneti) and yet the biggest culture shock I've ever faced is in LAS VEGAS. It's like Mars. Last time I was there, I witnessed an interaction between a young girl who had just gotten back from a rave at around 9:30 am and and older gentleman in the elevator of the Luxor. The girl said "I too so much E and now I can't remember my room number." Then she asked the older man "are you rolling?!" and he said "Have you every heard of Jesus Christ?"
Alice Ct maybe ?
The best I've ever gotten was when I was stuck in traffic on the Bklyn bridge. The cabby looked into the mirror towards me and squinted. He said "You are Jewish... yes?" Trapped in the moment, I wasn't sure how to proceed but I decided it was best to be truthful and after a moment I replied, "Yes..." There was a long pause.  Finally, he looks back into the mirror and simply declares. "At home we fight, but here we are friends. We have the same food."
