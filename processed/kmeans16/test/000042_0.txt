Just finished The Stand. DISCUSSION SPOILERS   Oh boy was that a good book. Laws yes. A few points I'd like to make:  1. Character development was absolutely phenomenal. I read the uncut edition so I don't actually know how much was added in but I felt the character development, especially in characters like Stu and Larry was fantastic.   2. The bits towards the end with Tom and Stu literally had me tearing up. The Christmas day singing :'(. By that point I realised my heart was just invested in these characters.   3. Once the mystery of the dark man was lost I felt like the story kinda lost something. It's like in Lost, once the mystery of the Island gets figured out, it's no longer that spooky which is why I'd say season 1 is the best. In The Stand, Randall Flagg only really stays spooky until he becomes an actual antagonist. When King starts writing in his perspective, although it does give us a lot more insight and story in the west, I feel like it detracted from the kinda mystery elements of the dark man.   4. Ending was kinda predictable but thats not necessarily a bad thing. However I didn't like how the nuke exploded.   Overall though I loved this book for character development alone. It's so bloody long that when characters die it literally is like "holy shit". That was the first King book I read, where do I go from here? :)
You gotta start practicing again. Do small things but most importantly just stop giving a shit what people think of you or whether they will think of you negatively. Say what you want. Be who you wanna be and if thats someone who is brave then do it.
They wanted a futuristic robot in a film so they...literally built a futuristic robot...
Yay! Good job! :)
If you've posted about your anxiety. Well done.   I just want to say that a lot of people on this subreddit make a post stating how awful they are feeling and how they feel like they are never going to get better. I'd just like to point out that you deserve a congratulations for even posting about your current problems! Discussing something that a lot of people really don't want to talk about because you want to get it fixed is a first step in itself and something to be proud of! You aren't just lying idly and not attempting to get it solved. You are actually reaching out and putting in work despite feeling so awful. That is honestly one of the most motivating, beautiful things. Literally just saying "fuck you" to anxiety and speaking about it, talking about it, getting help.  So to all those who post asking what they can do to get happy or un-anxious again I just wanted to say that you already started doing it :) Love you all
That was quite beautiful.
As a 19 year old guy who is a HUGE game of thrones fan. I can 100% tell you that your boyfriend does not watch it for the boobs. Also the first few episodes may make you feel like there is always nudity but it really gets less and less frequent as the show goes on and got more popular. The show is amazing and you should absolutely watch it if you are interested.  I think the real issue here that you need to address is the  fact that you get jealous at the thought of him looking at boobs. There was a really good video posted a while back where the guy explains scientifically why a guy might look at another girls breasts as its biologically programmed in men but also that literally 95% of the time if you were to ask them about that girl later on in the day they wouldn't even remember them. A guy is biologically programmed to look at breasts. Yes he might have a "hah boobs!" moment for about 5 seconds but after that he will forget about them and in no way should you feel jealous because he wants to be with you!  I'll actually try and find the video because it was really interesting.
Once you're out you'll feel better! The sun is amazing for making you feel good but you have to actually leave the house for it to have an affect on you. Within 10 minutes you'll feel great. Go ride! :)
And tell me how it goes.
Do you have any friends or family you could call right now to talk to and tell them how you feel? If you keep stuff like this bottled up to yourself it can literally drive you insane and it doesn't need to be that difficult. It feels so good to talk about it. Literally call someone who you know will listen, and just let it out. Cry if you need to. Get someone to come round and just open up. If you feel comfortable, talk to your fiance but if not thats fine. If you have no one to talk to, I'm not going anywhere.
Yeah, I agree.
Just read that you passed! Congratulations! :) Knew you could do it!
Although he was under for long we usually say around 15 minutes is the limit in an avalanche. This person was rescued relatively quickly.
Whats the song? Is it from halo?
Fuck the king!
bro! I have the exact same thing. After watching that video with the new picture of amdromeda where it slowly zooms in i felt like i was gonna have a panic attack. It seriously puts everything into perspective making u feel extremely insignificant yet at the same time significant by your mere existence. I also find it funny because most people on this subreddit have things like social anxiety or health anxiety yet I also have this like existential anxiety, its usually worse at night when you're lying in bed just questioning everything. It is literally the most terrifying thing when you truly sit down and try and comprehend your own existence and existence of anything in general. Even typing this now I'm beginning to feel a bit weird.  HOWEVER. At the same time its fucking awesome that we are all in this crazy boat together. I mean in the complete and utterly incomprehensible face of it all, we still get up every day and go about our business and try and lead meaningful lives.   The way I look at it is that you are not an insignificant thing INSIDE the universe but you literally ARE the universe contemplating itself. You are this big badass scary thing, that is you!    I'm literally going on a tangent here just getting excited about all this crazy stuff :) One last thing though, I seriously recommend you listen/watch some Alan Watts videos. He is like a psychiatrist for all existential induced anxiety. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMRrCYPxD0I -Thats a good one.   :) hope u feel better
