My penis is fully erect from this coversation, I'm caressing it just like I would to what would be left of your penis if you were here with me. I can just imagine it, blowing my load on your face. Your stubs (I'd make you an amputee and tun the hole in the stubs into mini anuses, like any good owner would) clawing at my crotch begging for more of my hot mayo. You're searching for something aren't you anon? The reason you're so angry and have one night stands with the wrong people. Once you come with me you'll become a part of me, no wait, an extension of me. I'd do whatever I want and you'd just roll your eyes back into your skull, arch your back and beg for more. Trust me anon you'll love it, they all do.
Why not? If someone is willing to buy it, you could polish a turd. The commenters are the ones that are buying this polished turd. You are right that it was forced and the analogy to a polished turd is excellent, but just like gold, a worthless rock, it has value because people give it value.   Once the button runs out, I dont think they would put it in the code for, say, "innitiate the launch sequence" or "send this command to that specific server." That would give it away. There is probably something monitoring it or one of the mods will do something once it runs out. To say that "because the code doesnt give it away, then nothing will happen," is a little bit jumpy.   And how is the button not emotional? The factions wouldnt have formed if someone didnt feel anything about it. Yea we cant vent the same amount of steam as running 4 miles during a soccer game would allow us to, but we still get to vent some. The small victory we get from watching the button survive another day is something. The arguments like this are small football games we play with each other.   You keep saying that the button is not as great as life or sports, and I already said the analogies are stretching on my side, sure. Yea the button is not the next great sport we will watch on payperview, but that doesnt mean that the elements are not there. That doesnt mean that the small victory of a small three pointer is meaningless. You called it meaningless and im saying it isnt. Yea there are way better things we could use as stimuli, but there are also worse.   The button isnt the "next best thing," but it is still "a thing."
