Not really, if "nothing happens" and accused terrorists are tried and found guilty before "anything happens", these organizations would look just fine.  Problem is - the only organization with a meaningful record of "thwarted attacks" (the FBI) has constantly been exposed as deliberately entrapping people, re-contextualizing, relying on unreliable sources for false convictions, etc. Meanwhile, what we get from the NSA is massive domestic spying, international spying on allies, while the CIA is busy running black ops toppling democratically elected governments.  Calling for reform isn't an imposition of a catch-22.
They used to post stuff like this - and worse, regularly on the Golden Brigades division facebook page (Iraqi army) - including videos of torture. Not just of Sunnis - they took a video after burning alive a Sarkhist Shi'ite (during their short lived rebellion) and drug the corpse around the street chained to a motorcycle.  There are *tons* of videos like this, they don't have the same production value as ISIS videos and don't get mass media attention like ISIS. Something seemingly hard to comprehend for a lot of people is that almost every major group plays dirty.
Can someone give me, like a proper example to help me understand the term?  Orthodox Muslims get a rap among ignorant bigots in the West because of this concept which has nothing to do w/ 90% of most people claiming to be Muslim. The issue is that Twelver Shi'ites are in modern times a very substantial subset of the overall population and happen to be vocal in media and politics, and this concept is the bedrock of Twelver Shi'ism. [An example of taqiyyah in action:](http://arabic.al-khoei.org/falea.htm)  :                        :       .   That's from the website of al-Kho'i, a venerable mujtahid in modern Twelver religious tradition. He's being asked if it's permissible to lie in debates against "innovators" (non-12ers - i.e. one of the types of taqiyyah) and al-Khoi is clarifying that it is as long as it is useful in winning the debate.  Here's some narrations on the concept from Twelver Shi'ite religious tradition:  http://twelvershia.net/2014/05/29/1184/
Last I checked Allah has no Air Force and an army of peasants with 30yr old ak47s so desperate to escape a life of poverty and boredom they blow themselves up.  Isn't that what the Soviets said in Afghanistan? And what the US said in Iraq 2.0, Afghanistan...  If those were military victories in your mind, you really need to re-assess what winning is.
That's not really true though. Content surrounding conspiracy theories that were massively upvoted have often been proven correct (Israeli military training of US police forces, widespread domestic spying, use of tools by police to intercept cell-phone data, police provocation at protests,...and this current thread). There's bound to be plenty of non-sensical threads with 10-20 upvotes or what-not, but if you go through the wayback machine and simply compare the most upvoted content against later determined facts, it doesn't seem to be a sea of crazy.
As somebody else clarified - I should've said twice in a row.  I got caned two strokes at school for splitting someones lip and the bloody housemaster managed to cross the strikes being the sadistic fuck he was.  your experience was probably a bit different from this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4r_izRZYLw
I'm going to take a swing and guess "proletariat" is not Reddit's core user base. Apparently your average city cop isn't "working class" according to these clowns.   You can be working class and still be aligned against your own interests, the same way you can be black and vote against your own social interests, or be a poor Christian and vote against your own economic interests. There were Jews in the gestapo...your criticism of their use of the term isn't very well-reasoned.
I wouldn't be surprised if you got shot.  Except that this is the version of events according to the cop - while several witnesses saw a man with his hands ultimately in the air being executed. Regardless of whether the cops version of the beginning of the events is accurate. And if you've dealt with cops anywhere in this country - especially in law, you'll notice that it isn't as a big deal to fudge reports, or even commit outright purgery. Examples abide in r/bad_cop_no_donut and r/law.
As far as I know, we know that this is not the case at all. So basically I'm asking, why would he say that when it's not true?   As far as you know? Let's start there - can you link to academia and what modern consensus is on this issue - if there is any consensus on it?  I believe there's a paper written on this topic in particular. Don't remember what journal. The tradition you're referring to says              .            It isn't necessarily saying 'whoever ejaculates first determines it' - it can be read as saying that it depends on the dominance material from one gender had over ( ) material from the other gender leading to a closer similarity to the paternal uncle (in the male scenario).  We can nit-pick wording, but at that point, we'd be criticizing people for saying the sun rises. I think the meaning and motivation behind such sayings is more important.
Because at the time of his death, all we had to go on was the police fabrication that he was threatening the cops with his fake sword. You can't raise fuck-all with a story like that. As for Mike, outside of the Fox News watching half of the country, the fact that somebody stole some cigars and was than gunned down cold in an unrelated shooting certainly isn't controversial - let alone that being a crook isn't a good reason to get gunned down.
Thought about it for 2 min, and I was just being preposterous and regurgitating somebody else's stupid conspiratorial claim.  The reason that post is at the top and this one is at the bottom is that the members of the sub are collectively pandering imbeciles.
There would be a lot less conflict between us if the Muslim world in general would just accept the existence of Israel and stop inciting against Israel and Jews.  I don't know about this incitement against Jews in the Muslim world. I've been fortunate enough to meet, or know of through others, Jewish communities that thrive in Morroco, Syria and Iran. An incitement against Israel? Sure. But against Jews that have been living in Muslim countries for generations and aren't (at least not overtly) gung-ho on the Israel issue, doesn't seem to generally be an issue.  There would be a lot less conflict between us if the Muslim world in general would just accept the existence of Israel and stop inciting against Israel and Jews.  Nobody in the Muslims world doesn't accept the existence of Israel. It's hard not to accept that there isn't a place called 'Israel' on the map nowadays. If you're saying that you hope Muslims would just cow-tow to this recent geo-political change though and accept the new state of affairs into perpetuity, then you've misunderstood your neighbors. The Crusaders lived in Palestine for generations. They had children, and their children had children and their children's children had children -all before those who refused to live as subjects of Salah al-Din were sent packing. As much as you want to maintain the status quo, and many Muslims want to revert it, only time will tell how the Middle East will look in 50 years.
but I just can't take actually watching these videos anymore.  Really? I've said it once and I'll say it again - the production value these guys are putting out is amazing. I've watched a lot of videos over the years put out by different governments to propogandize their military achievements. What's being produced by these non-state actors is some of the best by far.  This one is just a long propaganda clip with a bunch of action (executions, drive-bys, battles, explosions) with a bunch of Arabic anasheed in the background. It starts by encouraging people to oppose 'oppression' and then breaks into the various clips of their activities in the region as well as some posing (going into sujood near large explosions). Very well-edited, practically professionally. They have explosions for instance which if you got a keen eye, you'll know they threw into the video even though they didn't connect. They also use great effects. Around the middle of the film they begin their standard preaching and what-not (the boring stuff) but get right back into the combat footage after a few min.  Edit: Also noticed that whereas with ISIS videos and the like, a lot of the fighters are obviously older men. This video - they're all kids. Almost everyone in the video is under 25. The video is very tailored to the kids without jobs who likely lost family members or friends during the Sisi coup.
