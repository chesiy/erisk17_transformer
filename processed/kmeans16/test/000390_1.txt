I need concentration not energy. But I'll look into it.
So it doesn't matter how the word was intended to be used, but only how it was perceived?
5 hours now. Absolutely no effects were felt.
Fake adrafinil questions.   What are site confirmed to have fake adrafinil? And what exactly does adrafinil really look like? I bought 5 grams from powdercity and it's a very pale pink color. The reason I ask is because I didn't feel anything after 600mg dosage.   Any help is appreciated.
Concentration and being more alert
How is it mysogonistic though?
I gotta find something. I really don't want to turn to amphetamines.
No law is truly "unenforced."  Good evidence, glad you commented.
Happy?
It does for sure. But I took 600mg of adrafinil and 18mg of caffeine 3 hours ago, still absolutely no affect. Should I try modafinil once I'm out of adrafinil? And should I continue to take my adrafinil even with no effects?
I know right? I'm not Communist and I understand that it's a "oath" but really? A felony, with a minimum of 1 year! That is straight up bullshit.
What do you mean what about them?
Hallucinogen questions.
i'm saying in a suitcase that you dont carry on should be pretty safe.
Armodafinil/Mofainil/Adrafinil as an alternative?   I have an incredibly bad work ethic and focus on work, I've taken all sorts of CNS (Central nervous system) stimulants. even Amphetamines, and recently I've came around to Afinil's. do you guys think these are viable option for it, if so which ones would be the best. All advice is welcome!
I did a 50mg test dose. No adverse effects. I went with the 300mg advice. I felt absolutely nothing, except a little floaty feeling in my hands and legs.
