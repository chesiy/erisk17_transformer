You can't argue with this logic from a coffeshop in Krakow.
Completely agreed although i think that the feedback of the driver i a massive factor in the development. He can feel hoe the car reacts to updates/ changes. Telemetry doesnt always show that.
mostly to the inconsistent calls on the RAI/RIC and HUL/ALO incidents this sunday. but as the consensus on this subreddit is that they made some questionable calls i thought it would be some fun fluff.
but this "speeding under the safety car" rule is measured by lap/sector time right? so he could go fast for 200m and back off again after that i think.. Anyway, it looked pretty quick right at turn 1.
and still finishing 10th, awesome!
One of the rookies maybe?
Totally spies ringtone.
this is very unnerving
off to a good start...
Ha! i recognize the piece you did @roest in Amsterdam, been there once or twice for a festival and it caught my eye. What a coincidence to see it again here on reddit. Great work by the way, love your style.
From the Awolnation song Kill your heroes: "never let your fear decide your faith"  New stuff can be pretty scary but take the jump. Look at the positive side of things and don't get scared of by the negative/unknown.
Prince at Sziget 2011 (or 2012 im not sure). Im not a prince fan, but that show was so amazingly thight, professionally played. But the best point was it didn't feel like that because of the really fun, natural interaction he had with the crowd. Allround amazing performance.  Second best was The Naked And Famous this year. Sounds even better live than their records.
Meedoen is belangrijker dan winnen!

Ha, i live at about a 5 minute bikeride from the ziggo dome!   Sadly that is the bad part of the city :(
Met bier en Starcraft ben ik al een heel gelukkig man.
Aaand save
Even curses follow the law nowadays.
Rain had that, totally screwed it up. He played so well for the first half.. but oh man what a game, nerdchills!
Really loving all the subtle things in this season so far, the zealot in the dish, the cheese throwing, the balance joking (reaper changes, super long range on nexus cannon) Just gives it that little extra!
Unranked queue matches vs ranked queue?   So I (diamond Protoss) just started playing around a bit on the unranked ladder as Zerg (my zerg skills are bronze/silver i think).  I got matched vs a platinum protoss player and lost quite badly. after the match i noticed that his league symbol changed to diamond. So after a quick chat i found out he queued for the ranked ladder, and got promoted to diamond after the match. I think this is a bit unfair. **What do you guys think?**  TL;DR: Opponent gets promoted on the back of my diamond protoss MMR, while I played offrace on the unranked ladder. Fair/unfair?
I dont know if this was already posted on here, but Totalbiscuit made quite an interesting [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uwAo8lcAC4) about this topic.
you a pretty dirty window.
Ja hoor jongens, weer iets om trots op te zijn!
Well, that is the least touched game on my desktop i think, and i have only played a few PvP's. So i can't really tell if it's pay to win.   It's pretty fun though, but i prefer the old aoe (:
AHWWWW man, I LOVE SC2!!!
Darn, missed it, can i watch a vod somewhere? (: EDIT: already found it, thank you for casting that! hope you liked it (: oh and you pronounced my name really funny but no worries, the 'oe' sounds doesn't exist in English(:
Submitted mine!
