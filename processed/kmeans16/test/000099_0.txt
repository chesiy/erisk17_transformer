The district  as well as the Johnson City Press  received an anonymous email Tuesday morning claiming that a group of players held the younger boys to the ground and rubbed their bare penises on their faces at a Fellowship of Christian Athletes football camp this month at Tennessee Technological University.
Franklin?
I love Jimmy Fallon.
I hope his name is Yoda.
You know, the first thing I thought when I saw this picture was, "this has to be in Tennessee." It was confirmed when I saw your user name.
This happened to me earlier today actually. My brain went into overdrive and I wasn't able to answer either question I was asked for several seconds.
From East Tennessee after a snowy night!
I was just about to ask if you broke even with the record company or if they had to recoup their advances? Or if it happened some other way?
Reese Cup?
All hail the Pig!
I love it. I've lived in several parts of the country as my dad was in the military and when he retired we moved here.  None of the places weve lived in can compare to East Tennessee.  Depending on where you live you have the best of both city life and country life. Southern hospitality isn't a myth, everyone treats you better here. It's a great place to live. And actually I just transferred to Middle Tennessee State University last year so I'm right here outside of Nashville when school is in session. I think choosing to live between the two places would definitely depend on several factors but if you want the option to have a quiet secluded life (with a view) East Tennessee is the place. Also,  not that I'm saying your life has to be secluded in a place like East Tennessee, because it doesn't. You just have that option if you want it. Hope that helps!
Oh Em Gee.
This is what I see.   http://imgur.com/r9UEzHs  Near Jonesborough, TN.  Edit: Much like, so wow.
I imagine you live in a normal house, but when you go to work, or duty calls, you walk out to your back yard where there is a hatch that says "quarantine" on the back of it. You slowly make your way down the ladder where your co-worker, who we'll just call Desmond for the sake of the story, meets you and gives you the low down on the night before. You guys go into a dome shaped room where a computer sits in the middle of the room and you enter 6 numbers in a specific sequence. If you fail to enter the sequence in an alloted amount of time and hit return all of reddit will cease to exist. True or False?
First thing that came to mind.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-Esh4W3dfI feature=youtube_gdata_player  "Who's in charge here?" "The Clawww"
