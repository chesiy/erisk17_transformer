You're welcome! :)
Dammit Dynamite, this is totally me...How do you know this, are you the one watching me?
This poor fucker, what did they eat... the table? I can't imagine dealing with that many food allergies daily.
Thank you so much for replying, I will definitely treat myself beforehand...Tuesday is coming so fast I can't believe it.  I've arranged for my boyfriend to look after me afterwards so I'm pretty fortunate to know I won't have to do too much with a week off...But, it was still a worry for sure...  Its good to hear the drugging happens quickly, I'm going to be a ball of nerves at the hospital. But, I definitely realize that you're right...My pain is too bad to prolong this and getting a diagnosis is worth it.  I'm so glad to have gotten supportive and encouraging feedback, it means so much to me.
I use a shampoo bar from knotty boy "for dreads" even though my hair isn't dreaded, its natural and amazing. And it makes my hair and scalp feel amazing...As well as soft for my hair...Its completely free of sulfates and silicones as well as any other nasties...  I ordered it off their site and it was around $8 plus shipping which was around $9 to Canada...Its lasted me over 3 months though and I've barely made a dent in it.

Aw, thank you! :) My budget isn't great I'm kind of limited to drug store and discount stuff at the moment...I'd really like to keep my everyday look more of a natural kind of thing but I'd really appreciate any other look suggestions you think would like good! I think I just prefer natural where I'm new to make up. I like highlighting my eyes, maybe my cheek bones but I have no idea where to even start on that one.   I really appreciate that suggestion I'm definitely going to give it a try! I'm picturing it and I think you're right about the definition without harshness...I do find the black liner a little harsh around my eyes.
That sounds very very doable, and hmmm...I will have to look into something a bit cheaper for sure, I'm a student on a budget but I appreciate the suggestion.  And thank you! :) I find its a bit red without foundation but overall I can't complain. haha.
Thank you! :)
Hmmm, that is odd. And thank you! :) I definitely will, I've gotten so many compliments since then that I honestly can't even believe it...People I don't even know have stopped me in person just to tell me they look good. I really appreciate your comment, its really nice to receive more positivity than negativity. :)
Yeah, you're definitely right...I didn't wait long enough for it to dry...I thought I did but I didn't. And I didn't have any clear coat besides glitter. I know for next time though! In hindsight I should've left them white with the purple and pink middle piece. It looked tidy.
No, I'm located in Halifax, NS, Canada!! I definitely can't afford to travel that far!
Thanks! I'm drawing every spare moment I have!! haha.(Although that isn't much as I have had a summer job and I'm in an intensive IT program) I'm focusing on dot work designs lately. I find they turn out the best. I've been trying to focus on tattoo-able designs.  I actually did have an artist in mind and got a side tattoo from him but he's never taken on an apprentice...I'm thinking once I'm back to the city I'll go in and talk to someone from the same shop.  Thanks again for the advice!
Recent Post after taking advice from fellow ArtistLounge users. I'm happy with the improvement. Thank you!
It's just a quick pen sketch with a little bit of color...I thought it would still be worth posting. Hope you like it! http://imgur.com/Bgob3O9
