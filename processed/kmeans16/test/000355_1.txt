Same boat! I'm just going to stick it out until February! I'm trying to do things on the side though, like working concessions at a concert or something, joining clubs in the area via meetup. Idk, its going okay... Or just quit now and start traveling!
They have a product, I think it's called monkey butt or something similar. Made for your ass swear but works the same
Witness protection?
WTF are we going to do? Ugh
Any antidepressant will have people that say good or bad things about it. It depends on the person and what they respond to, and other factors in their life. I'm on it now and gets me out of bed, no anxiety, but makes me feel nothing. But, in a way I'm back to my old self, as far as personality. It's the best out of the 3 I have tried, but do not feel happy at all. I was prescribed welbutrin in addition for energy and getting my emotions back but I feel it makes things worse and stopped.
I'm writing this from my new phone that seems to be malfunctioning so forgive me if it's hard to read.  He said I would move to somewhere with palm trees soon. (I was moving to Florida the following week). Said I would get into trouble with someone named ****. And that this guy was talking to other people and that would get me in trouble. (Not sure on this one. I had met a drug dealer with the same name, a month later I was supposed to pick up and the day of our plans he got arrested, lost big money. Then later found another guy with same name --all within the same week-- as soon as he told me his name I called it quits because of what the psychic said. Could have put me in jail for a felony). Hmm what else, he said I'd have to make a big move in march and id be deciding between 3 places. It'd be a big decision but the decision I would make would be the best one (I did end up moving mid march because something bad happened. Was deciding between living in Florida, home, or with a relative.) Also, said I'm one to "cover my mouth" and not speak up. But I will and it will get me to a better place. Well, what happened during those rough months was due to me speaking up to my boss, which may have been bad to say but it turned out for the best.  Basically said I'd be okay and that I was kinda fucked up be okay.
I have the same degree, graduated in May. I've gotten offered sales and marketing jobs but fuck the man. I have business and refuse to contribute to the overwhelming consumerism. I don't care at this point. I'm secure at home for now and will wait until I find a good job. I don't overly care/worry about work, I care about life.  Oh, and I remember reading an article that was on the top 10 companies that hire new college grads. Google that! You're going to have to pay your dues if you want to work in HR, I think.
Good for you, not just for realizing you have a problem, but for getting your wife involved and putting things on the table.
Honestly, if you like her is suggest waiting until dating. Things might get funny with sex, it happened to me.  Trim up decently. Make sure you're clean. Then start kissing her. Eventually feel and caress her then fuck her. Also, if you get off quick and then button up, you will be a dick if she got no enjoyment out of it. If you care about her, you'd get her off too.  I despise guys that leave after they cum after 2 minutes. Nothing more disrespectful.

Just like every day- wake up and say "today im going to be great!" Take a hot shower and grab a coffee and remain optimistic. Find something to look forward to! Like next weekend of an amazing dinner you're going to cook when you get out of work. It may sound cliche but you if you tell yourself you're going to have a good day, you'll start believing it.

So much always happens in an episode, I feel I have to comment while watching the episode to actually convey everything I want to say... But that's not going to happen.  Love Lip's stuff still, I really don't think they're going to get him caught in some way like the others... Unless this is the last season - interesting way to end the show for good is if they put everyone in jail or suicide. I think it's becoming more clear that his storyline will be to enter the professional world and succeed, even if his luck pisses viewers off  Definitely want to kill Sammi. At the same time, I thought she was going to kill herself after she told Ian he was great and going to be okay. Her, Ian, and Charlie could all be in the running for a suicide ending, hopefully not. I think there's going to be a crazy season finale of a very smart death brought upon by Mickey and Fiona, maybe the rest of the Gallagher squad as well.... BUT at the same time, like Lip said last episode, Carl going to jail was inevitable at some point, and Ian getting caught is as well. It was something they were responsible for, Sammi just bridged the gaps I guess.  Don't get Debbie pregnant. Don't. Urghh. Still, I do like the relationship and don't think having sex was wrong for her. Yes, she'd still young, but at least it's in a caring, healthy relationship, plus they seem to be best friends which is most important (i think) during teen sex.  Fucking Fiona, okay, the kiss was in a specific context but just... be a prude for an episode or something.  Hate commenting on Frank but he's so in love, even if it's a friend kinda love. This makes me upset, but happy at the same time. I think the doctor dies at the end of the season, showing that Frank can experience heartbreak and sadness -- I don't think she'll be cured or they'll call her with a fake positive or anything like that.
Well that's no good.
Really interesting thread, the comments completely show the opinions of the males and the feelings of the females. Emotionally, as a girl that's been through this, i would be upset too because I tend to have the "I need it all" mentality with guys and friends, and I can't always get over a hook up if it's not someone I met that night, and have to face as a friend/acquaintance. I know it's bad and not right to do it to him, but it's just my emotions.  Now on the practical side, I would love to say I can move forward and he should not feel bad about my interpretation and doesn't need to apologize.   I think it's best to both remain practical and show hints of remorse for not being on the same page, as well as learning that girls are weird and emotional.
Grab generic food from aldis or save a lot of something like that. Maybe a bag of chips for every 2 people. Cook something, like a homemade dip or brownies. Invite people to bring something if they'd like or plan on making smores in the microwave or something silly... like a taco party, or a nacho party.  games like cards against humanity, charades, apples to apples are cool. and of course drinking games like have you ever, truth or dare, etc. are fun (even if you're not drinking).
