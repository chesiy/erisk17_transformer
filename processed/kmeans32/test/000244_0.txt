1.Don't ever use alcohol on it, invest in a good saline solution...(h20 or wound spray) 2. Don't touch or play with it 3.Don't put creams on it 4. Sleep on the other side of your body, back, or face. 5. Keep it really clean! Don't submerge it in pools etc.
Make it into a fine powder, and force them to snort it? Then hay maker them into oblivion...
You're welcome! :)
Now...If he had both that would be even more terrifying.
From box dye to barbie. Nice! :)
The quality of line in this isn't on par as far as crisp and clean goes...did you want it in that 2D hand drawn style? If not I would consider going else where.    Not trying to sound snarky at all by the way, I apologize in advance.

Thank you! I'll likely update this post once its done
As someone who recently discovered their own bisexuality I'd say its most likely him learning about himself...Its more about discovery and exploring himself and his sexuality...I wouldn't worry that he isn't watching straight porn...  In fact I've found porn to cause trouble in relationships no matter what kind it is...  I'd definitely say that him being bi isn't going to make him cheat on you, it just means that he is attracted to people regardless of gender. He's still the exact same man you've always been with...  May I recommend you head over to r/bisexual for more advice if you  want more opinions of people who have good perspective on this.   Also, its rather intrusive to go through his history...That's private and I'm sure you wouldn't appreciate it either...Being bisexual isn't a reason to distrust someone
Thanks! I'm definitely going to look into this!
The lather from shampoo actually isn't a good measure of anything as its all chemically created...I use dread shampoo and the lather is very very minimal and consistent because it doesn't contain these chemicals...Even Sulfate free shampoos typically have other chemicals in them...  My hair acts much better and the natural oils in my hair are not stripped from washing daily. Because I use natural oil based dread shampoo, which comes in a bar like soap..It doesn't strip any oil. Its all about what you're using.
Thank you for the advice and well wishes, I'll look into heating pads for sure!   I know what you mean about exercise, I lose my energy very quickly. And its super frustrating because I used to be an athlete and now yoga is hard. But, I'm going to keep at it.    I'll try to keep physio in mind if/when I get a diagnosis.
I've been taking fish oil as part of my supplement routine as well as vitamin D.   I'm actually as it happens lactose intolerant, I do try to have milk alternatives for ice cream and milk but mostly just veer away from it all because I find soy bothers me as well.   I can see how exercise can help, I'll have to start trying some yoga..  Thanks for the advice and the well wishes, I have an appointment to see a surgeon/gyno on May 29th. Hoping she schedules me for a lap.

I'm looking for advice on how to improve my current make up or what to buy and how to use it based on my features and skill level which is very beginner...The first two pictures are me with make-up the last is without...I currently use:   foundation: rimmel London stay matte primer, Maybelline dream fresh bb, and an organic brand loose powder.  eye: bonne bell eyeliner in black, cover girl eyeenhancers shadow in sombre relzadora which is white with sparkle, covergirl lashblast fusion.  brows: flamingo brow pencil in light brown...its an off brand Asian company I believe.
Thank you! :)
First synthetic dread install:
Yeah, I'm learning its better just to do it myself! haha, mine don't turn out every time but atleast I'm only paying out for polish and remover! I totally agree with you, I'd feel soo bad if I couldn't give someone exactly what they wanted for their mani. I'm sure your nails always look beautiful, they definitely do in the now picture! :)
Is this acceptable conduct for a professional artist?
ohhhhh awesome!
No, I'm located in Halifax, NS, Canada!! I definitely can't afford to travel that far!
Best recipes for Baking soda and ACV solutions:   I'm looking at starting to use baking soda and ACV instead of shampoo and conditioner...Any really good recipes out there? That are more than the basic mix? Like something with tea tree oil etc. I'd really appreciate any advice I can get on this.
Where to Start?   I love the look of dreadlocks, I've been trying to grow my hair out to get them forever now. I haven't managed to do it but I'm thinking synthetic dreads would be a good alternative for me because I'm a Caucasian girl with thin/straight hair too. I'm wondering a few things about getting them...Such as how long should my existing hair be in order to put them in? And where should I typically go to get them put in? I've called a few places that offer extensions but no one there knows anything about putting in synthetic dreads...I know a few people that can dread actual hair would they have an easy time putting in syn ones?
TIFU by trying to shave.   My shower was going normally...and then I had the bright idea to try and shave in a stand up shower. This may sound risky in itself but I've done it before so I thought I was a certified pro at it. So, the arm pits happen without a hitch but then I start on more risky territory. As I'm finishing up  I'm realizing the quality of my razor isn't totally on the up and up. I only paid $6 for 3 so I should've known. But, here we are. I have a partially shaved butt and a bleeding finger. And to top it all off band-aids don't stick to anything wet, so I ended up getting blood all over my towel trying to get out of the shower. The worst part is it all happened at my boyfriend's house.   *As a side note, my finger took the brunt of the damage from the razor because the damn thing was so flimsy and cheaply put together the replaceable head comes off without any warning.
It's just a quick pen sketch with a little bit of color...I thought it would still be worth posting. Hope you like it! http://imgur.com/Bgob3O9
