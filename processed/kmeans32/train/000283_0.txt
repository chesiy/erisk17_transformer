Bat Cave
This is consistent with laws that enable one to be prosecuted for double homicide when a pregnant woman is killed.   I believe this is backwards. Most feticide laws in America were enacted relatively recently and have been accused as a way to grant personhood to the fetus.

The LP may not be from the 80s, but that mother fucker stepped straight out of a time vortex.  It explains why he's naked.   Looks like James Cameron got it wrong, you can transport live tissue AND phat kicks.

As usual, the media is just showing you what will get you riled up and not the whole story. Bastards!

Clouded? Is that what the kids are calling it now-a-days?
Since this was Reddit I was totally expecting the last one to be a huge spliff or maybe a dovetail.
Based on my Hollywood education that dog is a shape-shifting alien, a synthetic life-form, or has been possessed.
I know this is art, but it really should be tagged NSFW because of the breast.

That is just **WAY** too much energy in one area. I'm tired just watching it.

Sorry, don't have the source. I came across it when I was looking up ideas for a water feature in my front yard and mistakenly googled 'squirting fountain'.
It's the third nipple that does it
At first I thought why didn't Vivid make a movie with him. But then it hit me, who'd dare take a load from him, let alone a facial.
The cats reaction to the squirrel makes me think the squirrel is a pet or at least somewhat trained.
There are no negative effects to raising the minimum wage unless the wage is already at the maximum the market can support.  Given the lack of power those making minimum wage have there is little to no fear of that happening.
It's quite alright. I'm kind of thrilled it made it to Tumblr and back.
The original post was actually to /r/aww.  I am the [one](http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/25zlz6/stumbled_upon_this_little_guy_this_afternoon) who came across the little guy one afternoon this spring while its mother was off looking for food.
*Oh my!*
I don't know, just seemed like the thing to do.
Second Guessing Leyland   Here is my 2 cents about last nights disappointment.    End of the 7th, Scherzer's pitch count was at 108 and he was looking mortal.      Start the 8th with Veras, the unofficial set-up man. Get one out, give up hit bringing up Ellsbury.   Ellsbury has a marked L/R split, so pull Veras for Smyly whom doesn't deliver.      Since Victorino is only batting righty and Smyly's L/R OPSa is .446/.648 pull him for AlAl.    With Alburquerque's tendencies I don't like bringing him in with runners on but he K's Victorino.   Now AlAl gives up a single to Pedroia loading the bases for Big Papi.   Leyland decides to go with his main reliever Benoit.  This is a bad situational match-up, while Benoit had not allowed Ortiz a xBH in 26 PA (.273 SLG), with the bases loaded you don't go with a guy allowing a .385 OBA to the hitter.   Especially when you have an Ortiz killer in the bullpen.       Phil Coke has faced Ortiz 20 times with a triple slash of .150/.167/.317        Why would you activate Coke and not use him in the very situation he was made for?    Edit: Thank you to /u/wjg10 for the link the breakdown over at [Fangraphs](http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/assigning-responsibility-for-david-ortiz/)      TL;DR It wasn't a fastball down the middle. They call it a splitter (I've seen slider elsewhere) on the outside edge just above the knees. If Benoit missed with the pitch it was not by much.
