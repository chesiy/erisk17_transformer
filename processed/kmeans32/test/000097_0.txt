I do have the phone, but the screen is broken so no luck there. Would any other Blackberry do?
Well today's our anniversary so we're re-creating our first date and having a picnic in the big park in our city. After we eat, we're reading love letters that we wrote each other for the occasion (her idea, but it works nicely). I'll make sure she reads hers first and the I'll read mine. I've got a nice cheesy line at the end of it that makes a nice transition to me getting down on one knee. I know she's going to say yes, but I can't shake these nerves.

NFLPA to charge Cowboys, Broncos with collusion if Dez Bryant, Demaryius Thomas don't sign long-term deals.
I'm [outside](http://imgur.com/zxiZOh3) the statehouse right now and there have to be at least a couple thousand people here around the roped off area. I've never been more proud to be a South Carolinian.
Obama Plans to Expand Overtime Eligibility for Millions
The flag that was first put on top of the State House in 1962 was the Tennessee Confederate flag, which is the traditional, rectangular version we think of usually. It's well-accepted that that flag was used in defiance of the civil rights movement at the time. That flag was taken down from the State House in 2000 and the Battle Flag took it's place in front of the State House. It's only been on the grounds for about 50 years, so anyone arguing that it is a part of our state's heritage, is in denial.
Forget satisfying, this is downright fascinating. The planes all look like individual games of Snake swerving around the storms.
Bernie Sanders Rips The Hearts Out Of Republicans By Debuting A Real Family Values Agenda
Sanders: "This is not a protest campaign."
Oh yes, that was a very well conducted interview. I've always been a fan of her.
If you look on the Donors Choose website, the site buys the supplies that the teachers request and ship them directly to the teachers to maintain the integrity of the process. The state government isn't involved at all.

I've never heard that combination before, but wow, that just made my day.
Ring shopping is already underway. Hopefully we fulfill your prophecy.
My girlfriend and I dressed up as Cinderella and Prince Charming for a kids event back on Valentine's Day. It was definitely the most unique and fun Valentine's Day I've ever had!
It's actually in Spotsylvania, Virginia but otherwise spot on :)
Yea the Pittsburgh interview was when Frank planned the implosion. In Chapter 10 @8:40 Peter and Frank have a heated discussion where Peter tells Frank he isn't afraid of him anymore. The Watershed Bill failed and his people need the jobs he promised them and Frank had better fix it.  The next scene is Doug and Frank discussing accelerating their unspecified plan. Peter's confidence has been built up and they're losing control of him. It's time to put him away. This is the plan to have Rachel seduce Doug the night before a radio interview and get him drunk after being sober for so long. So Frank schedules the interview and tells Peter to be ready and to go to this gala the night before. There, Rachel works her magic at the hotel, and boom goes the dynamite.   Killing Peter was really just a spur of the moment decision by Frank. When they're in the garage, Peter is drunkenly babbling on about needing to come clean about everything that's happened. Well Frank can't have that. Peter wasn't supposed to be a liability after he withdrew from the Governor's race, but clearly he'll always be a thorn in his side. So how do we deal with a perpetual Peter problem? You put him down. Politics.
4th Circuit Court of Appeals finds Virginia's ban on gay marriage unconstitutional
Well.. at least she's a safe driver
As a young boy, I thought it meant I was on the cusp of manhood...
Some app developers just want to watch the world burn...
But why do specific nations have to play against each other in order for it to be a "world" championship? If the best players in the world are playing in this league, why should it matter if it's Denver vs. Seattle or USA vs. South Africa for example?
What do people think of "Recorded on: _____ " time stamps for future Let's Plays? Personally I think it would make tracking the near-countless inside jokes we hear easier among other things.  In the beginning of the Cannon Ball Run GTA IV Let's Play, for example, Gavin says, "What if this video comes out before the other one?" To which Michael responds, "Well then people will be confused." I think time stamps like that might be a bit more helpful to us, the viewers. Just spitballin' here.
In case anyone is wondering, this is The Lawn at the University of Virginia.
Does this mean the fire is "white hot"?
