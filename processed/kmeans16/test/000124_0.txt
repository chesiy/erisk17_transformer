Well it's obviously not your hardware, You're actually on better specs than I am for the most part. What I found was cranking it all down and making it the only program I was running. The slowly turning it up.

Help With VB6 Word-Swapper Project   My directions:  Write a program that asks the user to input:  	A sentence  	A word found in the sentence   	Another word to replace the first word that was selected  When the New Message button is clicked, the original sentence will be displayed with the users first word replaced by the second word.  For example, if the user types Learning to write computer programs is easy. into the first textbox, then easy and challenging into the second and third textboxes, the following message will be displayed, as shown in the interface below  http://imgur.com/IBmgqIc    I'm really struggling with this one and I am constantly having errors. How should I approach this?
Usually it has to be clever. Cutting and pasting to random images isn't the brightest thing.  Just a tip for next time. I'm really not trying to be an asshole.

I once had an appendicitis and my appendix was is a abnormal place. So when it rupture it completely popped and filled my insides with a purple goo. Plus with the fact that it was in the wrong place the doctors didn't find it for almost a month, resulting in an infection and a month in the hospital where I had 8 IV's hooked up to me and was constantly in pain  TL;DR - don't underestimate any medical condition  edit: I'm also a type 1 diabetic which further complicated things
No problem!
I had tons of fun beating the campaign solo, it can be done it's a little bit harder than co-op and after you beat everything you can do what im doing now and collect all of the special guns. Plus with sub-reddits like [r/coopplay ](http://www.reddit.com/r/coopplay) and [r/borderlands](http://www.reddit.com/r/borderlands) you can get co-op players easy! I completely recommend this game, it's my favorite.
PS3 [w] to complete my collection (I need lvl 50s) [h] everything that's not on the list inside    PSN: test_subject3919   want: transformer, bouncing Bonnie, nasty surprise, and I would like legendary heads if you could give them to me preferably zer0 or axton heads!  I don't have the badaboom, but I DON'T want it because I would like to get the last legendary for myself.  Almost all of my guns are lvl 50 except striker is 48 and neogenator and blackhole are 49s I also have sandhawks, evil smasher and fibber
