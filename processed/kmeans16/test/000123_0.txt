Directions unclear. Both pinkies now broken.
"Wlady, I'm hooooome."   "Give me a second. These old legs don't move as fast as they used to."   *German canned laughter*   "Oh Wlady, what am I going to do with you?"   "You can start with a warm embrace."   "Oh Wlady. Did I ever tell you you give the best hugs?"   "Yah. And so did 67 other guys."   *German canned laughter*
Holy crap.
Ali is quickly becoming one of my favorite fighters. His fight against Abregu showed his power, and his last fight against Santana showed his durability. His face looked like he was hit with a few hammers over the course of the night after that one.   Bradley is elite, as many of you have mentioned, but I really think we'll one day look back and talk about how he just wasn't the same fighter after Provodnikov. Sure, he got his win over Marquez after that, but that BS draw against Chaves started to really show that scar tissue building up on his face. We saw it again just recently in his fight against Vargas. Combine that with the series of concussions he's accrued (I think he closed out the fight against Vargas with one), and you have to wonder how much more his body can take.   I've heard him speak a few times about it, but that Provodnikov fight had him talking with a slur for nearly SIX MONTHS after it was over. No doubt he gained the appreciation of fans and showed he can bang, but definitely a cause for concern.  I like Tim, but if Ali gets the edge in this one then Bradley should really start to weigh his options.
Interesting. That first kid looks like he's not even 18.
Guess that's SI for ya...
Today's library book sale grabs   I extended my vacation past July 4 for the sheer fact that every Tuesday my library has a book sale (in the fall they do one every other Saturday). This is the first time I've gone on a weekday.   Here's my haul from earlier today, all for a whopping total of $5.   Shogun - Volumes 1   2 (Really stoked about this find. All I've ever seen in the past was the tattered paperback version with size 1 font).    A Conspiracy of Paper - David Liss   Read the first chapter, seemed interesting enough to give it a go.  The City of Falling Angels - John Berendt   I've heard things, so worth a shot.  The Alienist - Caleb Carr I've seen this book at previous sales and always passed it over. Decided to drop my hard-earned 50 cents on it this time around.   The Bonfire of the Vanities - Tom Wolfe   I've never read anything by him, so I'm not sure what to think. Definitely purchased this one on name alone.  And of course photos, since books are pretty:  http://i.imgur.com/GM48zgW.jpg  Thoughts on any of these titles?
I'm at 13.5 right now. Set the goal of 50 back in January. Not entirely sure i'll hit it, but I just closed out a nice run of three in two weeks.   Pirate Latitudes   The Great Train Robbery   Sarah's Key   The Killer Angels   Diary   The Devil in the White City   The Spy Who Came In From the Cold   Wampeters, Foma and Granfalloons   The Giver   The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time   Hyperion   Tales of Ordinary Madness   Breakfast of Champions (re-read for the third time)
And Twilight.
Hah that's pretty funny and from what I gather, very typical of him to do. I loved Mother Night, so I'm glad he gave himself an A for that one. Slaughterhouse Five is a classic, but I don't know if I'd rank it higher. In fact, here's my go (based on what I've read of his)  Mother Night - A   Cats Cradle - A   Slaughterhouse Five - B   God Bless You Mr Rosewater - B+   Welcome to the Monkey House - A-   Breakfast of Champions - C   Deadeye Dick - F   Wampeters, Foma and Granfaloons - C   Jailbird - C   Galapagos - B   Hocus Pocus - C+   Armageddon in Retrospect - B+   Bagombo Snuff Box - B+   God Bless You Dr. Kevorkian - C-
Truth be told, by bookshelf is kind of a timeline of my life. While I've already stowed away the children's books for the day when I have kids of my own, the collection more or less begins with my early interest in sports and fantasy. From there, a number on non-fic books start to pop up along the lines of "Alive" and "Devil in the White City," but there's also a good mix of humor with David Sedaris and Augusten Burroughs as well.   Yes, I have my one shelf devoted to Stephen King and Tom Clancy, another devoted to Kurt Vonnegut and Hunter Thompson, but for the most part I have a pretty solid, well-rounded library that I'm really happy to show off whenever someone says they enjoy reading.
I was just talking to a buddy of mine about this the other day. He's one month away from having his first kid and we were just shooting the ish, talking about growing up, playing video games (Goldeneye tourneys all dayyyy son), Magic the Gathering, D D, Warhammer, LAN parties for Diablo, Starcraft, Warcraft II, etc. Time goes by so fast. Hang onto these ones. They'll last a lifetime.
I kind of wonder a lot of the things you ask as well whenever I think of Bukowski. Was he someone that generation could relate to better than ours? What exactly about his style has cemented it in the legacy of writing? And to that point, what style does he even fall under?  I never really found him to be funny. If anything, he portrayed himself as the heroic anti-hero. And by that I mean, he knew he was a horrible person but by virtue of embracing it and pretending to not care what people thing, he believed it ultimately made him cool in the eyes of the reader.  I've never read Ham on Rye, but I've read his Tales of Ordinary Madness and Women. Both were awful. To be honest, I feel one picked up where the other left off. And it doesn't even matter which order you read them in. They're all basically about the same thing: Misogyny, alcohol, drugs, sex, horse racing, fighting, more drugs, more women, more sex, a crappy car, cigarettes, bowel movements, more alcohol, sex again, the occasional note about writing something, alcohol, sleep, a hot bath, and the list goes on.   I don't know why, but I keep trying to find something of his worth my time. I just can't seem to find THAT story yet. At this point, if the works I've read are any indication, I doubt I will.
Funny to see the main image being Stephen King. The first book that came to mind before I even clicked the link was "Thinner," but I GUESS he gets a pass since he wrote that under his pen name.  Also, the "cameo" was just his characters suggesting a scenario was like "something out of a Stephen King novel."
As a Penguins fan it was actually my first impression as well. It can go either way I guess. As a teammate of Letang's, you have to see it as dirty though, hence the scuffle.
"...through the gate!"   That's about all I remember hearing at first, as I shook off the cobwebs and gathered enough strength to bring myself to my feet. Last I remember enemy forces were lining up outside the fortress walls as I took guard in the camouflaged bunker just outside the draw bridge. Had I had it my way, I wouldn't have been there at all. At the least maybe they could've paired me off with one of the other guards. Instead, they sent me, a narcoleptic armed guard, to stand watch for any impending attacks. Not the brightest of ideas, but then again, a lack of intelligence was the reason for my kingdom finding itself in this position in the first place.   Fully aware once again, I heard the guard bellow from the tower for a second time.   "All is lost!" he screamed. "The enemy is through the gate!"   Perhaps the enemy forces marched right past me, assuming I was dead. After all, not many people possess the ability to sleep through an attack. But they're not me, Sir Serons of the Kingdom of Peels.    All around me enemy forces were charging forth to the soundtrack of clanking armors, barreling hooves and cheers of valor. I prayed they didn't see me peeping through the smallest of gaps in the bunker, had they even noticed it in the first place.    What was I to do? Fighting was futile. Running just the same. Even the choice to rejoin my comrades would require a  sprint to and through the gate, which at this point was entirely populated by the enemy.    Still hazy from my unprovoked nap, I rested my back against the bunker wall. There wasn't much I could do. As one of the guards had confirmed already, all was lost. Nothing more to do but wait until the cover of darkness in an effort to make my mistake.    Until then I'll just sit here, rest my head against the bunker and sl...
