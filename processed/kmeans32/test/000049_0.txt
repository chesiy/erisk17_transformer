It has been an eternity and i long for the feeling of affection, to care about my meaningless things, be loved or touched by someone but i can't get out. I really start to freak out wondering if i have broken my brain, gone too far. Would my sober life now consist of me being stuck in an asylum. I am now a nutcase and this weird feeling of everything is driving me crazy but there is no escape. I soon come to grips that i am powerless to change these facts, so i might as well make the best of it. Fuck it, this feeling is good and i am good. It is what it is, everything that was and everything that ever will be. I started to feel a nice sense of comfort with this realisation, all my trip buddies are feeling the goodness and are good. I think to myself this is why i like them so much, slowly everything starts to calm down as i begin to pick the pieces up of my sober life. I realise that i am going out later, that it is a saturday; tomorrow will be sunday and so on. time finally exists and I am free to do whatever i want.  I can relate to this so much
You da real MVP
10mg n,n-DMT vs 40mg   Im 120lbs and I heard that low doses of DMT seem to almost always induce a bad experience and that trippers should go for a breakthrough dose such as 30mg-40mg and that it isn't scary once you are in the experience. I am aware that it is one of the most potent substances and my only experience is with acid and shrooms. I want to test the waters since I don't know what my reaction to DMT will be like.  What is your suggested dosage? to those who are experienced with dmt

Strange heroic acid trip report,   So I took about 5 Tabs last week apparently it was very pure stuff. During the peak of the trip I saw a vision of dancing elves with hats around a glowing box. They were dancing around in a circle. I felt as if my whole life and the whole existence of the universe was a movie and inside the box was the ending, the plot twist of the movie. The box suddenly opened and everything suddenly changed and felt different. All the pieces to the puzzle fit in and my heart started racing as if the whole universe existed just so that it could build up and produce this one glorious moment. Like an explosion all this information came out of the box in a state of euphoria for about 5 minutes everything became black this is when the trip went bad and I felt like I was losing my mind. Like I had a taste of the fruit of eden and am now being punished. Like curiousity killed the cat. After the trip it was hard to remember it in detail and only now am I piecing it together. Im fine now and im over the bad part of the trip.   The room with the dancing elves was a bit like glowball which is a game on android.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBvaDtshLY8

URGENT help complex situation, alexander if possible   At the start of this 53 day streak I covered my glans with saran wrap.   This was done because it's a method of restoring sensitivity and dekeratinization in circumcised guys. I have a small slit to urinate and I take it all off at night.   This 53 day streak is my first streak over 7 days and I have a feeling that the saran wrap may be a contributing factor. I fear that the saran wrap could be a negative contributing factor to me getting such a high streak because I don't feel "super powers". I've been flat lining the whole time as well, no urges at all. In my previous streaks that were around 5 days each I felt a lot of superpowers, exactly the same as the ones others would write testimonies about.  What are your thoughts and what do you guys think of the science behind my predicament?
yeah
i wear it while asleep, what is the solution? my goal is to keritanize the glans and restore sensitivity to the frenulum, i'll PM you links to my situation since it was a dorsal slit and those are slightly different

How to improve your brain   My attempt is to try low stimulation activities, these include staring at a wall and doing nothing, walking while doing nothing or reading a book like nietzsche, our lives are full of overly stimulating activities like music, movies, games, porn the idea is to challenge the brain to live with normal to low stimulation, the brain should get "hungry" for stimulation and also your creative side will wake up even more. The mechanics for one activity goes:  Walk   thought enters head  time is precious, is this thought even worth thinking about, this thought is probably a rationalization or weakness is it?   next thought comes in "an urge to play a game", is there a good reason to play that game? no   another thought "is this worth precious human seconds?" probably not  eventually the boredom will fuel the brain for neuroplasticity and creativity for self improvement  thoughts guys?

Thoughts on self improvement and nietzsche?   After fully understanding nietzsche i have discovered just how flawed the society around me and myself are. I found all my delusions, rationalisations, false interests, escapism all of it and it does feel terrible but I am willing to improve myself bit by bit. When exposing the overwhelming amount of flaws my mind kept on switching between giving up with a sense of nihilism (it's all going to end anyway so just live life and let it go) to the will to life and the will to power (Life happens once, be completely honest in every moment) the eternal recurrence started spawning ideas in my head, If I were to repeat this life with the lack of meaning and delusions for eternity how unfulfilling would it be? Though if there were times when I stood up and acted against delusions and become brave and powerful, then a repeating life may be worth it just for the moments of greatness. Where to begin though? When my mind is solving a problem I just ask myself, is this the most important thing I could be thinking about right now? am I spending my days truly improving my life or am I just wasting it because of escapism and more delusions? Is the question "Am i doing/thinking the most important thing in my life?" a question worth asking, is it an important question? what if it is a result of a delusion? There are so many variables that my whole life is making me feel lost and powerless but the will to life still remains
