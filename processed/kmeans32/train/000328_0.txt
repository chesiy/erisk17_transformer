Refueling Friday! Birdseye view of F-35 gassing up.
I can't see her face, how do you know she was a beauty?

Heh!
Oh boy. You might catch some shit for this one...
Yup, you're right, those were still around when I was 10, but on their way out. Thanks for the description of how they worked!  *In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida* will always remind me of the original version of Red Dragon called Manhunter.
Nice. Good choice.
Well, sounds like the glass is half empty for you!
Ah yes! Ty for the clarification.
The female kangaroo has three vaginas.
Nice! I knew about Aces High but didn't that artwork was actually on a record - looks like the single, right?  Also, good find on Mike Oldfield. I have his album "Tubular Bells," but never heard of this one.  Thanks!

In the pacific northwest, there's a small, harmless snake (the garter snake) with a wide ranging diet. One particular population preys mostly upon newts, the catch being that these newts contain tetrodotoxin (apparently aquired from bacteria; the same chemical is the toxin in pufferfish). As a result of their prey's super-potent nerve toxin, the snakes have evolutionarily modified the sodium channels in their nerves to be less responsive to that toxin (which has had secondary effects of decreasing nerve performance). Of course, this set up an evolutionary arms race, with more toxic newts evolving, which lead to more resistant snakes, which lead to more toxic newts, etc.   However, tetrodoxin takes a while to break down. It disappears fairly fast from most of the snake's tissues, except for their livers, which it accumulates in large quantities for long periods of time. This has the potential effect of making these snakes toxic to many of their native predators, especially birds. Other species do this too (dart frogs actually get their poison from ants and beetles), so it's technically truly a poisonous snake.

Heh, excellent answer, thanks!
Now that's my kind of fruit.
Sounds like Judo.

Never give up! [X-post /r/wtf]
My brother just sent me this picture. For the first time this winter, I wish I was on the East Coast!
Who can tell me what airport this 727 is landing at?
Redditors on death row, what do you plan on ordering for your last meal?   Even if you aren't currently on death row, you can still answer. I would have fried clams, flank steak, garlic mashed potatoes and a double IPA to wash it down
Sent Mom a link for a gift idea for my 3 year old. She gets this on click. (NSFW)[X-Post from r/funny]
Looking mean in matte blue.
I don't know about the rest of you, but I get lost on this site for hours sometimes.
