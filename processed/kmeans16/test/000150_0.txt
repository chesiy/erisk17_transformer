I was working for a small bus company in NYC, tours, airport transfers things like that. My boss was a good guy and a lot of his contacts were through friends of his so we were always getting really nice clients and jobs. I was waiting for a group to come out of the Natural History Museum when I spot Jerry Seinfeld cooling down after a run in Central Park right next to my bus. I told him I was a big fan and asked for an autograph and he just gave me the haughtiest look I have ever been given in my life, he snorts and just walks away rolling his eyes. Seinfeld hadn't been on for long and I remember him begging to get on Stern when he was working the tri state area, that's when I found out his distaste for giving autographs to the point he even included it in his American Express commercials years later. Whatever, right? Fast forward a few years and Seinfeld is bigger than ever and I'm driving around the UWS giving a night tour to this group really nice group from Alabama, they could not have been more friendlier if they tried. Well I pull up to a light and I spot Seinfeld talking with a friend at his corner, he's looking for a cab and I remember the snub from before so I get on the speaker, point him out and then opened the door right in front of him and in about a minute he was surrounded. The look on his face, PRICELESS!

I think the important thing id that everyone has a different vision with how they want their home to be. This is a very nice shell where people can add or subtract as they want. I like the size but I envision the plumbing all on one end and most important a bed on the floor, not a loft. Either a murphy or a roll out.

I checked http://karmadecay.com/results/u5022919 and had no luck with Google image search, anybody know where this is?
Thanks, it's not my description it's theirs. I didn't want to change it if for some reason the link didn't work and somebody wanted to search for it on their own. I got the wife an ice cream maker as a bday present and I'm looking for idea's gearing up for the summer. :)

OK No problem but as you can see I did karmadecay it before I posted. It's not worth arguing about. It's gone and have a good day.
Yea, that's along the lines that I was thinking. I've seen them with goose neck in the bed. I've seen school buses going for $3 grand with a ton of miles on the engines and I'm worried just how reliable they are. I drove for a private bus company years ago and we were using brand new Ford Cabs with extended bodies like this http://imgur.com/0gh6xLd and it was a bitch to get certain parts sometimes and we had our own mechanic and we were based in Brooklyn New York. Something like this http://imgur.com/qWldpwL
While it's kinda cool it really doesn't have a lot of room for books so I think this belongs here.

Trust me, the first thing to go in a place like this is the quality of the food and the ingredients to make it. They buy cheap and hold for as long as they can which is why I can't stand having a big menu in a small place because once people think the food is sub par while they might buy a coffee or tea they will get anything else somewhere else.
