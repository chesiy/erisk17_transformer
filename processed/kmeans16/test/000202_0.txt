Thank you so much for your tip!  I hope our sales trend will be like yours.  I can't even imagine what the Fall is going to be like... I'm excited!
I'm really such a noob and I'm not sure which resources it is lol.  My hosting company pointed me to the "resources" icon on my cpanel and it shows that I've maxed out the usage.  You were absolutely right on the backup plugin being the problem.  I've since installed p3 profiler and apparently the Ready! Backup was taking up the most juice. Since I've disabled it, the blog is much better.  Thank you so much for dropping in and helping me out :)
I'm only on season 3 and so far it's been great.  I'm a little worried for he up coming seasons now... Ehhhh
So pretty! I love the color combination and your cut.  Your whole look is beautiful!
:(
Oh dear...
I have a pot of aloe that I can give you if you'd like to pick it up :D  Message me!
Thank you guys so much for replying.  I really wasn't sure about it but after everything I've read, and all of your posts.. I think that I'll pass on the offer.
I think it's cause he is so confident around women that it takes them by surprise.  He also does have a nice voice and I bet he knows how to sweet talk.  I don't think he's ugly, but he definitely gets hotter women than you'd expect.
I make soap and sell soap, but I still love trying out other people's products :).  I love looking at the ingredients label so anything with fun or exotic butters always catches my eye.  I love an all olive oil soap but I know that it's going to be a little slimy in the shower and have little lather.  I don't personally care if it's colored, but I do LOVE a good exfoliation soap for my body.  For my face I like an unscented or very lightly scented with essential oils, uncolored, bar of soap made with lots of olive oil.
Ms. Betsy looks like she could be our boy Neo's sister!! http://instagram.com/ohhallo  *edited cause of missing words lol
My whippet never does this!  I always see photos of whippets on their backs but mine seems to prefer the " nose to the butthole " position. ... Hahahaha
I'm not really sure.. maybe a total of 20-30 minutes?  As soon as we got off the Bart, walked up the stairs, and we saw a line that was already formed outside on the corner.  Someone was there at a table selling round trip tickets.  The shuttle arrived after 10 minutes of waiting and the ride was 15-20 minutes.  Make sure you only use clear bags or gallon ziplocks.  We totally forgot about it, but good thing my purse was pretty small :D  Have a great time if you decide to go!
Hm.. hard to pick just 1... I think that trader joes' dark chocolate peanut butter cups are darn delicious.  Their cookie butter dark chocolate bars are addicting too.  Then there's chocomize where you can add whatever.  I like their premade salty bar.  Kit kats are bomb, and so are almond snickers.  I'm hungry... can you tell? Hahahahah
Henry Cavill.  We were at the Immortals premiere and I saw him take photos with female fans in the theater.  So I gathered up my courage, walked over, and asked if he would take a photo with me... Well he turned around, took a look at me, and said " oh they are going to start  the movie" then went back to chatting with the hot girls.  I guess my t-shirt, jeans, and glasses wasn't very cute :( *edited to remove typo
I posted it as soon as he left... so at the time it did just happen lol.
