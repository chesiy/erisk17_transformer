You must check out Prahran Convenience or IGA and grab Gardein products.  At woolies grab the fry's products in the dairy part the snags and hotdogs are the bomb! I'm vegan and thats what I eat....a lot :) Also for organic stuff the Fruit Peddlers in Northcote have everything you need as well. http://thefiveminuteguide.com.au/2013/11/14/the-fruit-peddler/ - https://www.facebook.com/pages/Prahran-Convenience/327183647396414 - http://www.frysvegetarian.com.au/ - https://www.facebook.com/gardeinaustralia
