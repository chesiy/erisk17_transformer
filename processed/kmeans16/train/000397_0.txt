The only reason some people think there are so many different types of Satanism is because we live in a time where anyone can create an online persona and spew garbage without any substantial basis. Press them for details, sources, or consistency and you'll be met with something along the lines of "dude, stop being such an asshole. Do what thou wilt*, bro."     *Protip: Do what thou wilt does not mean "do what you want" and it's actually an anti-Satanic statement. It means find your "True Will", so that you achieve spiritual enlightenment. No thanks.
My comment was not aimed at anyone who is content with their life, regardless of their monetary success. If that struck a nerve with you, that was not my intent. What I was aiming at are those who keep harping that our membership fee is some kind of greedy con (any MBA can tell you we do not have a profitable model) and that their public forum with thousands of free members somehow makes them relevant in some way. Which leads to OP's issue. And what LaVey was talking about was in regards to people trying to impress him with all their occult mumbo jumbo and how they were some great Anti-Cosmic grand wizards but couldn't pay the rent, so brother spare a dime?  I know this makes some people uncomfortable, but money is a useful metric for success. It is perfect? No. But it works well enough to filter out the flood of garbage our kind of aesthetic attracts.    Your life story is not unusual for a Satanist, shit happens, you suck it up and handle your business. I'd be more proud of myself if I were you. Hell, if I'm ever in DC I wouldn't mind getting a drink and talking video games.

Thank you for the conversation, had a great time!
Handle that however you want, just don't try to lean on some crutch that your approach is supported by LaVey's teachings, it isn't. He had a lot less tolerance than anyone here towards "theists" or people claiming some other brand or origin of Satanism, especially in his later years. He even spelled it out in Satan Speaks: "The only person in recorded history to codify Satanism into an applicable religion is Anton Szandor LaVey."  He chose his words carefully (codify, applicable, religion, recorded).
Recently listened to: Chelsea Wolfe,  King Dude, Sleep Research Facility, Sol Invictus, Waldteufel, Cult of Youth, Sutekh Hexen, First Aid Kit, Phantogram, Grimes, Purity Ring, Martin Denny, WIFE, Altar of Plagues, Burial, Cold Cave, oOoOO, Tokimonsta, Ulver.   Yes.
I have a couple of Therion albums somewhere, I liked them and will give it another shot. I'll definitely check out that podcast.     Oh yeah, and check out Dave Ingram's latest band, Down Among The Dead Men.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7G6j3FcWN8
I have no idea what the membership count is, and the Church of Satan does not disclose it. What I do know is that the Central Office is constantly processing memberships, responding to media contacts, and following up with active members.    There is only one High Priest at any given moment, currently it is Peter Gilmore. Where are you getting these ideas from? LaVey stopped doing public performances in the 70's. He never meant for Satanists to do anything "in the name of the Church" other than apply Satanism in their everyday productive lives. The idea that this somehow "changed" when he died is inaccurate.  Here's a video of the 6/6/6 Satanic Mass.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1zsIk6WcNM  Here's a video of a lecture at the Maryland Institute College of Art https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpI_TvJXc84    Here's the successful kickstarter campaign for a Spanish translation of the Satanic Scriptures    https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kevinislaughter/las-escrituras-satanicas-the-satanic-scriptures-in    Listen to Magister Coop talk Satanism, art, and rock and roll on WTFPod   http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_318_-_coop    The Church of Satan does not see a penny from sales of the Satanic Bible. Royalties of the book go to LaVey's children and his former partner, none of whom are involved with the Church of Satan.   What's a good pair of shoes run you these days? If $200 is going to break your bank then don't join. The Church of Satan actually rejects applications and refunds money very regularly. http://imgur.com/E1BPd
I believe in the power of symbols and archetypes. I believe in living your life without guilt but also acknowledging my own limitations and flaws. I believe that man's most natural, instinctual state is best represented in the symbol of Satan. I believe there is no afterlife, there is no heaven or hell, and that this is the only life we have. This is the opposite of spiritual religions, who believe this life is in preparation for an afterlife, and thus take the name of the accuser, the opposer.
There certainly is a satirical nature to it, sure. I don't believe I'm better than everyone else, there are plenty of people I respect and go to for advice or assistance if needed. I strive to be the best ME I can be, and at times that means working with others who share my goals.
Sure thing!

*Into everyones life appear individuals who just dont seem to want to go away. They surface in many forms, but have certain common denominators. They are epitomized by the guy who is 86ed from the local bar for stirring up shit, falling through the plate glass door and suing, welching on bar tabs, and carelessly almost setting the place on fire. A week after he is told his business is no longer welcome, he pops in and tries to cadge a drink from his old buddy, the bartender. Just like nothing had happened.*
As far as I know, no.
