You are factually incorrect. To quote the text of the 10th Amendment: "The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."  It says nothing about the powers not EXPLICITLY granted to the federal govt being reserved for the states. Therefore, any implied powers are also reserved for the federal govt. Since the power to regulate marriage on the basis of sex has been implied by the majority opinion today, it is therefore deemed to have been one of the powers of the federal govt since the 14th Amendment passed, on which the decision is based.
Wait how? Just because the electoral numbers don't add up? It doesn't work like that.  Perot was much closer to Bush than he was Clinton. So if we say for example that, of those who voted for Perot, 60% would vote for Bush and 40% for Clinton, Bush would have a clear majority of votes. Then you'd have to distribute that on a state by state basis, but the consensus is that Bush would have won.
RED ALERT ON PRO #2!!!  Even if the seller is an attorney, you pay your own attorney to look over the contract and advise you. He could easily write a contract with a term you don't understand and screw you over with, **especially because he's an attorney.** It will not be a big expense compared to all the other closing costs. You'll still want title insurance, a survey, and inspection (which will all be required by the bank anyways). Do not cheap out on the attorney, or it could easily come back to bit you for 10 times the cost.  Other than that, just be aware you will independently (as in without your friend) be responsible for the entire mortgage payment if the upstairs rents move out.  Also be aware of the potential costs you're taking on. Water heater/AC break? Your expense. Tenants upstairs literally begin taking axes to the walls? You'll need to take proper eviction proceedings and know how to do that (you'll need an attorney). This will require an emergency fund for the house specifically of at least $10,000.

See I always think that, but the way Edgar just absolutely manhandled Cub makes me question it.  I sincerely hope Aldo moves up after McG, and Edgar sweeps the floor with Urijah and we get Mendes/Edgar for new championship. That's the only fight in the division that would make be worthy of a championship fight after Aldo leaves.
Interesting you bring that up. It's certainly something I've considered. I just need to sit down and run the numbers. Thanks for the article!
And I'm arguing you that you abolish all of those programs and replace with universal healthcare. It's cheaper per capita than what we pay collectively.  As for the supplemental insurance, the point is that some people will never be happy so you give them the opportunity to pay for faster healthcare.  And for being glad to hand money over, it's something that's the right thing to do. I know because right now I'm poor and know what it's like to need resources and will be happy to support those in need. I've given substantial money to homeless who were in need when I was earning money because I could see they needed it. That's what being human is about.
I think that if the counselor felt it necessary to push boundaries, she should have the discretion to. Many kids are not forthcoming about their abuse. If 9 kids have to be needlessly interrogated to save 1 from an actual abusive household, I believe it is worth it. Yes, it's a hassle for those kids, but there will always be innocents in any sort of system.  The bar for defamation would have to be that she knowingly made a false statement. I don't know why you're assuming the counselor said anything other than "I suspect the following abuse..." She is obviously doing her job and should be given the benefit of the doubt. Of course if I am wrong, OP is gladly free to correct me on this point.
Just finished It Follows. I've been waiting for the last 3 weeks to see it and... Just wow. It did not let me down.  Yea some of the music was pretty bad but that was about my only complaint. A lot of the shots were very well done. I particularly liked the ending where it's following them both as they casually stroll.  You just get so deep into the psyche when you see Jay getting desperate to bang those dudes on the boat, and the pure panic in her eyes when the window first broke. I loved the concept and am really glad this movie made its big break to 1000 theaters.  Coming from someone who absolutely hates scary movies and only saw this because it was advertised as a scary concept and not jump-scare heavy, I just want to say this movie thoroughly delivered on that promise.  I hope to see more from that writer in the future. P.S. What year was it supposed to be? That little shell reading thing made me think current, but the house phone and other things made me think otherwise.
So what?
It should be a thing. I don't think I, or anyone else I know, realized just how much work it would be. I had multiple law students describe it, but actually doing it was a complete wake up call to the amount of work that had to be put in.
Ok bud.

Well damn. All right, let's do a breakdown. You have $1000, plus $400 on Amazon. Do you mind saying what city you live in? You need to be in a place with good public transportation (even if you get the car, b/c gas is expensive), that is cheap, and has jobs.  Step 0) Sell everything you don't need. This includes the guitar, excess clothes, everything. If you absolutely cannot part with stuff you cannot carry on your back, you need to find one of those storage rental places that gives you your first month for $1 or some great deal like that. But be careful not to sign a contract for longer than that period. If you end up needing longer than the month,   1) Do you have a laptop? If so, you need to find places with free wifi. Usually McDonalds have free wifi so look there first.  2) Get a library card to waste time, read, and use their computers.  3) The $400 on Amazon is now your food money. They have Amazon lockers that you can get your items shipped to so you don't need an address. Buy small items that can fit in your backpack, and shop cheap.  4) Join a gym. Usually YMCA will give you a membership based on income. Check there first. This is now where you shower, shave, etc.  5) If you don't get the car, you need a place to sleep. Homeless shelters can probably be nasty and dangerous. If I were you, I would buy just an absolute junker of a car off Craigslist to at least sleep in. You can probably get one for $300. If you don't want to do that, start researching nearby shelters. I hear Walmarts are good at letting people sleep in their parking lots, but don't take that to the bank. Otherwise try to find deserted areas that don't look too dangerous. Warning: Don't sleep in the storage locker listed above. It's probably illegal and there are all sorts of dangers of freezing/heating to death, not to mention lack of oxygen if its airtight, etc.  6) Do you have a cell phone? Will your mom continue to pay for the plan? If not, then go buy one of those cheap phones with the pay as you go minutes and only buy the minimum and never text anyone. This is strictly for work contacts.  7) You need an address to put on job applications and where you can receive mail. Buy a PO Box from UPS. They have ones that look like real street addresses (http://www.theupsstore.com/mailboxes/Pages/personal.aspx).  8) Now you have all your immediate needs out of the way. And honestly all the above steps shouldn't take you more than 2 days. Now you start job searching. Apply everywhere. You cannot discriminate. It's already likely going to be 2-3 weeks before your first paycheck arrives. Fastfood places generally have high turnover. Put on a button-up shirt if you have one and make your hair look good. You walk in and ask if the hiring manager is working and tell them you'd like to apply. Another good place to apply would be CVS or Walgreens, basically small drug stores. They also generally have high turnover. And this is actually a good time to be applying. There's not a lot of competition from high school/ college students like there is in summer.  9) After you get a job, you want to get a place. Don't waste time finding an apartment you can't afford right now. Go find a rent a room situation on Craigslist. Shouldn't be more than $500 including all bills. And make sure its a month-to-month situation.  10) Now you can start looking at community colleges. I'd start with 1-3 classes you can take when you're not working. Seriously, college goes faster than you know. Think of it as 40 classes. That's all you need to graduate from a 4 year college. Or even start looking at trade professions your community college may offer if you're interested. You already applied to FAFSA, great!! Take any aid offered. Aim to start this summer! You'll be done in just a few years. If you want to transfer to a 4 year college, do your first 60 credits (20 classes at community college) before you transfer. If you take 3 classes each term, and don't skip summers, you'll be done in 2 years + 1 semester. That can be your Associate Degree or your step to transfer to a Bachelors.   While my situation wasn't as dire as yours, I went through something similar, getting kicked out, on 1 weeks notice, when I was 18 and still in high school. I ended up working and taking community college classes for some years before transferring to a 4 year school and graduating with a double major. I'm now on a full scholarship to law school with a fiance and a cat. I'm telling you this so you can see there's a light at the end of the tunnel. It will get better if you put in the effort. Feel free to respond on here or PM me if you have any other questions.   EDIT: Just saw you lived in rural Pennsylvania. That can't work. You need to get to the closest big city. It looks like Philadelphia is the biggest city in Pennsylvania by a lot. So you need to get there before any of these steps can happen. Try to get a ride from your mom since she's moving, but if not you need to use a tiny bit of your money to buy a bus ticket there.  EDIT 2: Just saw someone from Philadelphia say the job market sucks there. I looked up the lowest unemployment rates in the US and Salt Lake City, Utah is at the top with an unemployment rate of only 3.5%. But they have a very small population. The city on the list with the highest population and lowest unemployment rate is Minneapolis, Minnesota or Austin, Texas. I looked at a Greyhound ticket and they're $108 from Philadelphia to Minneapolis or $139 to Austin. They are both big cities with low unemployment rates under 5%.
I can see the difference. However, my point is that you are recognizing that someone can earn a title shot in a division they do not have any wins in.  You are not refuting this point.  I'm merely extending the point to #1 contenders who just lost.
When Tim did his AMA and came on here asking if any redditors wanted to help, I responded. Me and another dude went to Tim's house and played with his dogs and we helped type up his AMA as he dictated. He gave us both plenty of signed gear and invited us to a BJJ seminar he was doing the next day. Pretty cool dude.
A couple things to note. 1) Johny was injured when Lawler was climbing his way back up so an immediate rematch wasn't possible. 2) A contender losing and getting the rematch is pretty unprecedented (only happened with Shogun/Machida), whereas a champion losing and getting an immediate rematch happens all the time and is even more justified because the result was controversial   For the record I disagree with the rematch. I think Rory should get the fight.
I still stand by my statement than anyone with multiple MVP seasons is a HOFer. I don't care if they only played 2 seasons. I think that alone deserves HOF, but I realize people will disagree with me.  Also, a SB win, SB MVP, and 3 SB appearances. I mean that's better than 99% of all QB's. I definitely feel Warner has earned HOF.   Edit: Let me give you a hypothetical because I'm curious. Say a QB came into the league and had most yards ever in a season, highest completion percentage ever, most TD's in a season, least INTs ever in a season, lead his team to a perfect record and won SB MVP. Then the next season he had identical stats and record, but promptly retired after those 2 seasons. Would you think he deserved HOF then?
Just to reiterate on that 2nd point, OP.  We were all young and dumb at some point in our lives. Unless we have been told before, we don't know not to talk to the cops and fully trust them as authority figures.  Yes, you told them everything which will be used against you in court, but at 17, me and any number of people on this sub who like to chide people for doing that probably would have done the same thing in your situation.  Eventually you'll be past this. As for now, the best thing you can do is hire a lawyer if you can afford one.
I don't need you to lie, buddy. But let me entertain the question: how on earth do I seem insane? I'm legitimately questioning the guy when his story doesn't add up.  If it's a lie, then he should probably stop misleading people. I'm not saying it is, only that his story is suspicious, as numerous others have pointed out here. ~~But if calling people out doesn't matter, why are you doing it to me? I mean truly, who should be the one to "shut the fuck up and move on"?~~
Yea I agree. There's just no way.  I'm trying to give this guy the benefit of the doubt, but he's making it hard.  Like if he said his grandparents gifted him $10K, and his dad was a contractor by trade (to the point he could actually learn how to rehab a house by 18), and he got his loans from a hard money lender that happened to be his uncle. Yea, then I'd believe a little more. But with this story and his refusal to answer specific questions, I'm suspicious at best.
How off? I just don't see it unless you were earning at LEAST $12 an hour (which almost nobody would pay a teenager in retail in 1998). I mean you still had some expenses as you admitted in other posts here. You still had school, and you probably took some sick days here and there. I mean it's just a bit unrealistic when you insist that you did this all without any family help.  Also how in the world did you get a bank to loan you tens of thousands of dollars to you and your partner with almost no experience and no credit?
Smoke sesh brah
See now you have a reasonable argument there. There was likely something in your contract that said they must provide you with reasonable service, which any judge would determine Sprint did not.  OP, on the other hand, he just wants out (and maybe reasonably so), but you gotta pay according to the terms of the contract.
I'm not saying it made him fight a bad fight, only that it most likely affected him in some way. I think he would have done better if he did not have the mental aspect of nearly dying from the weight cut, and I don't see how you could argue against that.  I'm sure it was you, but whatever, deny all you want. It was minutes after my comment, deep into our comment tree when you're the only one likely to see it or with any motive to downvote. Further, you only had 1 upvote on your previous 2/3 comments, meaning if it was someone else, it's highly likely they would have downvoted me and upvoted you at the same time.
Eh.... sure.
Listen, I'm way more in agreement with Sanders' views than Clinton's.  But here's why I'm going to vote for Clinton over Sanders in the Democratic Primary: because Sanders won't win the presidency and Clinton can and likely would against any Republican challenger.  The reality is that if Sanders went up against a Republican challenger in the general, he would probably lose. The fact is that Americans in general just aren't that liberal. Here's a chart posted in another /r/politics thread that shows how the Dems of the US are basically the Conservative party of the UK (http://cdn.yougov.com/cumulus_uploads/inlineimage/2014-11-06/tax5.png). Yes it isn't a perfect representation, and is only one issue, but I think you would find that general trend to be true in many other issues here in the US.  While Clinton will do many things I will likely disagree with in her presidency, I'm thinking bigger picture. And I'd rather have Clinton in office than the ACA repealed, immigration reform stifled, marijuana legalization held off further, gay rights trampled on, and net neutrality a dream.  If Sanders (by what would be nearly a miracle) beats Hillary in the primaries, he will almost surely lose the general election, and you can say goodbye to all those issues I just listed.
Fake boob dude
Thank you for answering!
There are no legitimate reasons, therefore it makes the person a shitty person no matter what.  What you're saying is tantamount to someone admitting to killing their 5 year old child in a gleeful manner (which is the attitude this guy and girl gave off bragging of their cheating) and you saying you'll "wait to hear all the facts." A reasonable person can conclude that its not necessary to hear much more, and if there was a justification, the people would have said it.
I never said the case was clear. I merely said it was not alleged, it was a matter of fact. The United States court system allows for an allegation to become fact upon conviction by a jury of your peers. That is an indisputable fact.  Edit: Just for fun, I'll comment along with you. You didn't give context and I haven't read the interview, but I'll assume the quotations are from Tyson.  Point 1: Tyson says he did less time b/c the judge did not believe he committed the crime. This is where I introduce the concept that correlation=/=causation. Just b/c he was given less time than others does not equate to the fact that the judge believed he was not guilty. There were several other mitigating circumstances, such as the fact that some of the evidence was not as strong, or the fact that he had no prior felonies. Further, a Court of Appeals certified that the evidence was strong enough that he should not even be granted a retrial. If he really thought people believed he did not commit the crime, then why didn't the Court of Appeals vacate his conviction or at the very least give him a new trial?  Point 2: Tyson says that just b/c she falsely claimed she was raped once, she should never have put herself in that position. What position? The position of having entering a hotel room? The position of hanging out with someone you don't know alone? Any of these contentions are absolutely ridiculous and have no bearing on proof of his guilt or innocence and the very fact that he made these contentions is insulting to all rape victims.
staph, just FYI
Alright, someone explain why clocks start at 12 instead of 1?   And I don't mean the historical explanation. I mean the "hey that actually makes sense" explanation. Seriously, our 12 hour blocks go from 12,1,2...11 It just makes no sense to me. Like maybe if it went from 12,11,10,9...1 then ok I get it, it's going backwards, but this go 11 numbers back then start increasing by 1 thing makes no sense to me.  And no I'm not high, I just finished my college semester and have 3 weeks to sit around before Summer classes start so I've been contemplating a lot of boring things.
