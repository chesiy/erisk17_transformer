The sneezing dog vs the girlfriend of the guy with the little dick.
Hahaha... Why do I have so many down votes? This wasn't a negative comment.  I was basically saying that I wish this was the first image I saw on Reddit. It is hilarious.
Yep, Southern California here as well. I bet they were more afraid that there was water falling from the sky.   http://media2.giphy.com/media/NPyHgTkMStCXC/giphy.gif
Maybe 3rd nipple?
Perfectly timed ad placement!
I take the same medici... Oh hey, look, a bike.
He must have given away all of his spoons... Because clearly he doesn't give a fork!
Oh my God... Thank you. I can't handle when people do this. A little piece of me dies when someone I love says "seen this" without something like "have you" preceding it.
Doesn't she grab the purse to hit the dude with it?
Hahaha! That kid's face..."Uuugh .. Fuck!"
Cat owners, behold...
Upvote, because... Cats.
I was doing a frowny face. Apparently I am REALLY good at a frowny face.
Shared a soda with myself today... :(
Tough lives he has to live.
That moment you are so annoyed that you can't even blink.
After only reading the title, I came here to bitch about that story being cool but not funny... Then I saw the picture.   You won this round.
This, my friend, deserves an upvote!
Excuse me... A human. I don't see how it is fair to take that HUMAN'S life. I have been in the "young and irresponsible pregnant girl" place. Now I have a beautiful 8 year old daughter. It isn't my place to have decided whether or not she got to develop from some cells into an actual baby. I wasn't ready to be a mother, but I figured it out.  Honestly, I had to grow up quickly... But I would never go back and change it. I will NEVER agree with abortion. Sorry if you don't agree with me.  That is the joy of being a human and not just a clump of developing cells that doesn't get a say in anything.   Rant done.
Best. Fried. Chicken. EVER!
Is it an outie or an innie?
Oohhh come on, you down voters. That line was totally called for. Maybe a bit over used... But so is your mom. HEEEEYYYOOOO!!!
You rock... Calling now.
Super PHAT!
Not smart... or possibly a drunk?
Quick... Someone try a laser pointer!
Regarding anything charmander related...
They accidentally called her Sarah, instead of Jenny. DAMN YOU JENNY!
Anyone else see a blonde Emma Stone?
Wait... I shouldn't have drawn that on her face when she told me I could?
A few years back, my friend and I were walking through Target and they had some of these up. She literally got super pissed off that they would make something so dumb and useless and thought they were for cats or some other small animal. I had to explain that they were for display purpose only and not for actual use. She felt pretty dumb. It was awesome. I make fun of her any time we come across anything miniature. To her credit, she was a super stoner back then.
That's an adorable baby. Also, a great idea for a baby shower game.
