Rand Paul is making it an issue of his.
A turbo set up would of added a grand to the sticker price.  Hell, my ST was the same price as the base model.  If they wanted to make that car fast, they could of.  Instead they made it look fast and spent their money on marketing.  But hey, if you like having a small fasy looking car that isn't fast at all, then good for you!   Just don't cry when I blow your doors off.   And God help you when I start to put upgrades into it.
Don't you wish. I own a 3 bedroom house in the burbs, have a very nice investment account, and am part owner of a successful company.  But tell yourself what ever you need to, to sleep well at night.
The salt is fully diffused into the water.  No amount of filtering will take the salt out.  It's like trying to filter the sugar out of sugar water.  Isn't going to happen.
Dude, it's not that hard.  Make the tag, part of your pre swing ritual.  I line up behind the ball to look at what I'm going to do, and as I step into position, I click the butt of the club to my hip.    His issues is no reason not to buy this.  I love my game golf and have zero issues with it.
Preach brother!  I wouldn't be passing in the right, if the ignorant masses weren't in the left!  I don't cut people off, if I pick the wrong lane and loose a few car lengths, I deal with it and pop into the next hole.  I'll pass the guy taking his time up there eventually.
The hot deals are based on availability.  If they start booking a lot of times around that hot deal, then it comes off sale.   Kind of sucks, but it's not bait and switch.  That would be if you booked and paid for the hot deal, then they charged you the added amount later.

Sweet story and all, and glad you had a little bright on your day...  And before I sound like a jerk, let me just say that I've worked all sorts of retail and food service, and I'm always polite, but COME ON.  You chit chatted 20 min away, while the line built up?   Nothing drives me more crazy than this.  Look, I'll smile and nod, but I got places I want to be, that aren't in line, waiting to give you my money.  Can you please make sure to just move the line along.   Once again, sorry for being an ass, but I just want to pay for my shit and go, not listen to the two of you chat the day away.
I actually really like it.  It keeps things new and fresh.  Plus we won't have to wait for him to (maybe) finish the books.   It's similar to The Walking Dead, in how things are the same but different.
We used to have Hulu, then we upgraded to plus.  I then told my wife that I'm not paying go watch commercials.  Netflix it is.

Fuck you. That is all.
This is what i tell my wife all the time.  That and the speech from Team America World Police.  There are three types of people in the world; dicks, pussys, and assholes.  I'm a dick and i feel responsible to fuck assholes who think it's on to shit on you pussys.  She doesn't agree, but it's been 5 years, so i think she's at least accepted.
Police don't just show up and start harassing people.  Something had to draw their attention to said person. If that person then was polite, respectful, and didn't question authority and act like they know the law/their rights, then unless you are breaking the law, the cop will go away.   I've always been polite and respectful, and i always walk away.  My friends tend to mouth off and make sudden movements, and end up in jail.   Is it right?  Fuck no.  Fuck the police, their agenda, and their corporate masters.  But, i like my "freedom", so when i see a cop, i do my best to be John Q. Public Taxpayer,  and i suggest you do the same.
If I was in this situation, I would go to his house, talk to his parents, find out when he will be home and give him one chance to make with the photos.  Digital copies before I went anywhere/let him out of my sight.  I would not directly threaten physical violence, but he would be able to tell from the look on my face that his well being currently in jeopardy.  Sometimes an ass kicking or threat of ass kicking is the quickest solution to a problem.
