[troubleshooting] new build wont boot with GPU   I just finished my first build. Without the GPU the system boots fine and runs normally but once the GPU is attached the screen just stays blank. Fans spin and lights come on but nothing else. 1 long beep then 3 short. Some googling pointed me towards the possibility bad video card. any other ideas? Any assistance would be appreciated.

Don't make it weird
I think this is right. In an honest discussion you have to be ready to be convinced. If you believe you have unique access to the capital "t" Truth  you are really just a salesman and do a disservice to yourself, the other party and the dialog itself.
this exact thing happened to me a few years ago. Bricks were indeed shat

What does r/hiphopheads think of Deltron 3030 - Event 2?   First, let me just say that Im one of those people who tries to listen to an album 3 or 4 times from beginning to end before I decide what I think about it. Some of my favorite albums I didn't even like on my first listen. So, this may be a little premature since Ive only gotten through it a couple of times, but Im slightly underwhelmed.   If Deltron 3030 is just a colab between Dan the Automator, Kid Koala, and Del then it an adequate to good follow up. In my mind, Deltron 3030 was one of the best concept albums of all time in any genre. Event 2 is missing that epic future apocalypse sound that characterized the first record.    Are my expectations so high that I cant help but be let down? What do you guys think of it so far?
I used to work with a guy at a restaurant who would take food to the back and finish it but only if the food had belonged to a girl and only if he would have made out with her.
Claims of divine revelation or divine inspiration dont necessitate the expectation of scientific accuracy. It sounds like you are referring to biblical literalism or biblical inerrancy which are a completely different.    Look, You don't have to argue like Pat Robertson is across the table from you.  Im not even Christian. I dont think the bible is divine anything, I think its an entirely human product. It tells us what our spiritual ancestors thought not what god thinks.   At the risk of being overly broad and simplistic, it breaks down like this. There are two basic understandings of contemporary Christianity. Call them liberal and conservative for lack of better vocabulary. Both are the result of Christianitys collision with the enlightenment.   One is a defensive rejection of enlightenment knowledge (conservative), the other is a discerning integration of enlightenment knowledge(liberal). But its important to realize that both understandings are recent. Phrases like literally true or biblical inerrancy arent first uttered until the second half of 1600s and didnt become common until the 1800s.    The idea that its dishonest for beliefs held by the community, literal or otherwise, to change based on new information is just ridiculous. To what other belief system would we apply such a standard? Why would we expect Christianity or its theology to be static? They dont exist in a vacuum, they are dynamic,  they grow and evolve and respond to history. Of course some literally held beliefs have been cast aside. Others have been invented from practically nothing (Trinity anyone?)This is the nature of ideas, the nature of culture and language.  That doesnt invalidate the entire tradition.  Look, I think the fundamentalist need to press their faith into sciences conceptual mold so that they can walk around with some  self deceived certainty about god and the universe diminishes their own tradition and is destructive to society. Yeah, ancient people believed stuff we know to be wrong (if only they had the benefit of your 17 years on the earth -just a guess-) Yeah some people, out of some sense of obligation to what they think they are supposed to believe about the bible or pure good ole fashioned stupidity, still believe some of those same things.    Im not sure everyone gets it, maybe cry about it some more.
I just think King spends so much time in the characters head that it makes it really tough to communicate all the important parts of a story visually. Which is probably why Shawshank is arguably the best King adaptation;  It's not terribly long and there is a narrator.      Apart from that can we just say, "do whatever Frank Darabont does."
Blows me away every time i see it. SO dirty.
The clown Jerseys? yeah, god awful.
