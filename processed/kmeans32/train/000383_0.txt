1. If you want to climb up your grammar and English language pedestal, learn how to spell and use proper grammar.   2. You are correct, being an asshole and reading have nothing to do with each other. However, as I initially said, it's fairly obvious what OP was trying to say, without going out of your way to be a dick and take the sentence as literally as possible using his poor grammar.   3. Even with OP's poor title, there is absolutely nothing that would imply causation of Shaggy being Arab-American "BECAUSE" the guy who voiced him was Arab-American. Literally nothing.   4. Again, sorry for "you" education.
Just finished All The Light We Cannot See...one of the most beautiful works I've read in quite some time.   I thought Doerr's writing was some of the richest and beautiful prose I've come across. His descriptions of geographical settings, or especially the feelings/emotions/thoughts of his characters were astounding. I loved the long, detailed, textured, rich descriptions amid the quick, staccato chapters and asymmetrical timeline. The immensity for which I ended up caring about all these characters, whether minor or major left me not wanting the book to be over. Can't say enough good things about this novel.
I know this game gets a ton of love here, but it just falls flat with me. I bought it while aboard the hype train after its initial release, and have played it about 10 times since. The first couple plays were fun, but then it just never progressed. My biggest issue is that I never get a real sense of completion. The castles seem small at the end, and there tends to be AP by the master-builder which stagnates the game at times. Each play, I'm just underwhelmed after.
[SALE] Sentinels of the Multiverse: Enhanced Edition $18 at Miniature Market ($27 at CSI, $27 at Amazon, $26 at Cardhaus)
Yea but for $1,499 you can get a *limited edition game AND a digital copy AND a look at how they made the art!* What a deal!
Yea, but aren't they just deals because no one likes those games??

Not sure if it's because you don't like euro games or heavier games based on your collection, but if you're looking to fill that void, I'd go with a euro. Keyflower and Caverna are fantastic. Terra Mystica is my all time favorite game, especially if you're looking for heavier. For worker placement, I'd look at Manhattan Project, Stone Age, Lords of Waterdeep or Spyrium. The game of the week right now is Bruges and that is immensely fun. Pretty easy to get into and a ton of depth/replayability.
If you have a problem taking sound advice from someone that either 1. ignores it themselves or 2. learned from their past mistakes, you're going to have a real hard time in life because you will run into a lot of those people.    You want to make fun of your mom for not working hard and use that as a reason to not work hard yourself? And you think that's not idiotic? Fast forward twenty years and your kid will be thinking the same exact thing as you are.

Meh.
their existing contracts...
Shit, sorry. that's weird, I didn't share it with a timestamp or anything, not sure how that happened. My bad.
I live in Buffalo, NY so I have some insight. Buffalo has an insane amount of infrastructure to prepare for winter conditions. The city and each surrounding town has an incredible number of plows and salt storehouses. They can clear highways and main roads in no time. 2 feet of snow on a Tuesday night? Bet your ass you're going to school on Wednesday morning.   Other cities just don't have the infrastructure for it and, just as devastatingly, people don't know how to drive in the conditions, which clog up roads so those few plows that do exist can't get through. It basically comes to cost for these cities: is it worth it to purchase millions of dollars of plows, storehouses, salt stock and pay workers for the 1 storm a year or every few years? Generally, no
Jamie from The Secret Cabal Podcast just got this. [Their Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/thesecretcabal) has a bunch of recent posts   pictures of the game. I have no idea what gameplay is like, but the miniatures and board look unbelievable.
Can't get it to play at work. Can anyone provide the run down?
Yea, I've heard it balances it out. I'll have to tell my friend to pick it up.
Haha I'll give you that
As you get deeper into board games, especially once you delve into medium to heavy weight euros, you'll see the thematic elements wane and strategy/mechanic elements increase. Some people love that. Some people look for board games to be more of a thematic elements aka "ameritrash" games. You may just prefer those types of games right now; lots of randomness, look, story telling, immersion and theme.  Try games like **Fortune   Glory**, **Betrayal at House on the Hill**, **Zombicide**, **Last Night On Earth**, **Nexus Ups** and many more. Those are all very heavy thematic and games with more of an immersion into the experience and theme.
Amazon has two different options for Among The Stars, with a $12 price difference. Am I missing something?   [Here was my search result for it](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Dtoys-and-games field-keywords=among%20the%20stars sprefix=among+the+%2Ctoys-and-games)   On the top row, I understand the middle is the expansion, but why is one Among The Stars listed as $29, and the other at $41? Just weird product coding by Amazon? There's no difference with the one that says Card Game, right?   **edit:** thanks for the responses, answered my questions!
Nice try, Chase
I don't think the FO wanted to run the risk of showing Gattis anymore, especially with no protection in the lineup. If he had a poor first half of the season...goodbye all value. I think it was the right move now. As Brad Pitt/Billy Beane said in Moneyball, "when you get the answer you're looking for, hang up."
Did everyone watch this team last year? Can we all remember for a second how putrid this offense was? With Gattis on it. 2nd fewest runs in baseball and roughly 87345763 strikeouts. Gattis' platoon splits are not good, his defense is terrible, and he was a great story that mashed home runs versus lefties with ease. It was magical 2 years ago when he hit all those game-tying and go ahead homers. Magical. But let's not kid ourselves. This isn't trading Gretzky in his prime. It's trading a home run specialist, whose main position is the same as your top prospect, in a time where you need to juice up the farm system. It's a win for the Braves.
My first thought was like some sort of murphy bed cabinet hybrid. I couldn't really find an image to back it up though. Or maybe just something more straightforward like [this](http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/29035/file-27822948-jpg/images/beaded-shaker-side-tilt-opening-dsr.jpg?t=1420219707322)?   Good luck on your tiny home! I think that's awesome! And if you can't keep any games I'd be more than happy to take some off your hands :) Maybe even give ya some money for them if you really need!
Thor has hands?
Scoring is not opaque at all in Terra Mystica. It's just done differently than some other games. Instead of a linear progression of building more valuable/higher scoring buildings, there are **scoring tiles** for each round that give bonuses for that round only.   For example, Round 1 might give a bonus for every spade used. Round 2 may give a bonus for every trading house built. So it's very beneficial to time your buildings (if possible) to coincide with the round scoring bonus. That and other things like the cult track are linear progressions...the higher you go, the more you score. When you build a town, get a bonus tile with points. Pretty straightforward.   Side note: Terra Mystica is my favorite game of all time. Freaking get it!
I'm as confused as you are. [This is the only sale I see](http://www.coolstuffinc.com/page/1175)
I'm, Christopher Walken, so, fuck, you.  FTFY
Pleasantly cool while fully clothed.   Take clothes off, go to bed under 1 thin sheet.  Boiling hot.   Edit: I can't type for shit.
It's an oldie, but this never fails to make me laugh.
Going to Ireland for 10 days and need a backpack, any recommendations?   I definitely don't need something huge. I'll be staying in hostels/hotels every night, so no camping eqpt needed. I was looking at the Osprey Stratos 36. Seems light, accessible and organized. Any others I should check out? My main wants are light, organized storage areas and 35-40L.
BrettspielWelt connection   So I have the client downloaded for brettspielwelt and a decent amount of the time I'll have serious lag. It'll be someone's turn and then just nothing happens...no turns are made, I can't click anything, I can't type a message and there is nothing wrong with my internet connection. Has anyone else experienced this? Any solutions?
