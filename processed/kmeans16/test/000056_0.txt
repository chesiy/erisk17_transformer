The first link states that  The United States forces will use [Al Taqqadum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Taqaddum_Air_Base), an Iraqi base near the town of Habbaniya in eastern Anbar Province, as their training hub, the White House said.

So you haven't provided proof of a new military base being built in Iraq.
A search of "Hilary" in /r/politics is showing the newest posts to be things like:   Martin OMalley Criticizes Hillary Clinton for Flip-Flopping   Hillary Clinton Said to Hire Former Wall Street Cop as Campaign CFO   Hillary Clinton's presidential announcement video is creepy    Gutfeld: Hillary's Campaign Rollout More Staged Than 'My Fair Lady'   How John Roberts Made Hillary Clinton President   Hillary Clinton campaign to accept lobbyist donations   Doesn't seem  like /r/politics is trying to justify Hillary at all.
It's been two year since Ted Nugent was supposed to be dead or in jail if Obama was reelected, so we at least know that making a prediction like that one or calling the President a subhuman mongrel, doesn't fit the criteria for who gets on the kill list.
Love Gunsmoke, it's my favorite otr show. Thought you were pulling my leg because I recently heard this episode and the first minute or two didn't sound any different, then when Miss Kitty came in, it all went to hell. Also love the new look. Great Job!
"The 'wisdom of the crowds' is the most ridiculous statement I've heard in my life. Crowds are dumb. It takes people to move crowds in the right direction, crowds by themselves just stand around and mutter."  "I don't care what anyone says, the masses are morons. My own grandmother is an idiot. You can't count on them to pick good stuff. Just check out Network TV to see what the masses want for entertainment. There's certainly a place for that kind of thing but it's not on Fark. Now go away and let me finish taking a crap!"
You'd have to get remarried if you move to a different state, if not, then it wouldn't stop gay marriage because gays would just go to another state to get married and come right back, thus nullifying any state law against gay marriages.
This isn't actually a dumb move, for a guy running for VP. Huck is figuring that the GOP nominee will be someone like Bush that is so pro immigration and education, that Neo-Cons will call them a "Rino", or someone like Paul that isn't pro military or anti drug enough for them, that there will be a need to balance the ticket with an evangelical.
So, on the one hand we got a Doctor who got a prize from the people gave Obama one for peace and on the other hand we have the CDC, ACLU   the UN? Guess who I'm going with for now?
In the 12 months since the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., almost every state has enacted at least one new gun law, according to a database compiled by the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Nearly two-thirds of the new laws ease restrictions and expand the rights of gun owners.   http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/12/10/us/state-gun-laws-enacted-in-the-year-since-newtown.html  If most of the new laws enacted were at the local level and "eased restrictions and expand the rights of gun owners" seems like NRA would have had more of a motive than the government.
Don't you just love how they announce that they're partisan right in the name of the site, "Welcome, come on in and rest assured that you won't read anything here that disagrees with your preconceived notions".
Susteren then asked Higbie about his time as a Navy SEAL, As a Navy SEAL, you have trained foreign troops? Right? How many times? More than one trip to Iraq?  Absolutely, we did two deployments, Higbie said. We did one in 2007 and in 2009. We did this foreign international defense over there, and its not effective. They dont have the accountability, and the understanding, and the actual fortitude to fight an enemy like ISIS whos dedicated. Theyre willing to die for this cause.  So, you didn't do the job that we sent you there to do?
Pretty sure naturalized citizens already pay income taxes and according to your linked article   Census said income households led by foreign-born workers, which includes non citizens and naturalized citizens, rose 1.7 percent over the same period of time.   62% of naturalized citizens are employed, as opposed to 58.6% for the whole country, the biggest percentage of naturalized citizens is in the management category: 38.2%, and  80% of employed naturalized citizens make more than $25,000 per year.  http://www.americanbanker.com/bankthink/looking-for-new-mortgage-leads-try-naturalized-citizens-1069738-1.html
Googled "1/3 of Americans Believe"  In addition to OP's headline, I Got  "in UFOs"  "in Bigfoot"  "1st Amendment goes too far ..."  and "astrology is a science"
What I never see explained in these type of stories is how common burglars and carjackers know that there has been an increase in the amount of concealed carry permits being issued and therefore a greater chance that their potential victim may be armed, do they go down to the sheriff's office and ask? And if the lowest rungs of the criminal element aren't aware that there are more people with guns, then how is it a deterrent?
The U.S. says it will send John Kerry to Kiev in a show of support but made clear it is not seriously considering military action over Ukraine.
The prosecutor leading the investigation into last year's massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School plans to appeal a decision by the state's Freedom of Information Commission to release 911 tapes from the shooting.
