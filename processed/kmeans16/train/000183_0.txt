Problem with csgo performance
Black Ops 3 and 621   The number 621 and variations of it appear many times during the BO3 "Ember" teaser. I probably missed many times it appears, but here are the ones ive noticed. At 0:59 the time of the newscast 6:21, 1:10 the Olympic running world record 6.21, twice at 1:28- stocks up for 62.10% and for RPRK up 6.21%, at 1:56 bottom left is the time of the newscast 6:21 AM, 2:05 time of newscast 6:21 PM, and during the military scene at the end 2:26 upper right is the time.  Most likely nothing important but something i noticed.
i guess i just haven't decided yet
hes a hipster
nobody cares
tldr
'Molunova' DayZ/ArmA 3 map idea progression   So i have added some new ideas to my map (it is still just a drawing that i have moved from paint into paint.net to allow me to have more freedom to do assorted things) First, some 'story' about parts of the map. the northern most city, "North City" has a tall wall going around the surrounding area. Players will need special clothes in order to survive the radiation of north city for more than a minute. North City will have lots of military loot and will (hopefully) be a hotspot for players to go to to get good gear. This idea isn't even 10% done, so any feedback would be highly appreciated.  http://imgur.com/dhDhOZO
The terrain is a 70% replication of the island of Ireland, rotated 90* to the left. I have some basic ideas on where mountains will be, but haven't given much thought into choke points yet. no cities or towns have been added yet, as i am having trouble designing them
get better

i assume you have mild to severe autism
try to be less obvious about trolls next time, might be more effective
