Yes! Make sure it's good and stinky, but easy to eat.  I hope you can keep trying to get your hands on him -- he doesn't stand much of a chance without human intervention. This might require lying on the ground by the shed for a while in the dark (been there, done that) but it's worth the effort in the end. You may also be able to borrow a humane trap from local rescue groups.
C'mon, [tell us what you *really* think!](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=tell+us+how+you+really+feel)  EDIT: People, that's a *joke*. I agree with /u/oubrew.
I think you have lots of company.
Not my OC, although I've hiked this tail so many times it feels like home. This pano is just one of many on the main site, some of which need annotation. Note that many pages of this volunteer project are available for sponsorship.
They certainly don't belong here, in a reddit where the rules clearly state    Please do not submit news, especially not to start a debate. Submissions should be a great read above anything else.  OP, you even tried to pick a fight by changing the headline. Reddit isn't  in a "struggle to stay afloat" -- if you think so, you need to get outside the self-involved bubble of the relative handful of users shouting about this.
This is an interesting article, but it appears to have been lifted entirely from [this much more serious site](http://www.blackpast.org/aah/white-walter-f-1893-1955) and reposted on what's apparently a clickbait site, with the added insult that the "rewindingbalck.com" version actually *claims copyright* on the plagiarized text.  Thanks to the OP for posting -- but next time, may be you could check the source a bit more.
Please start by reading the reddit Guide to Columbus in the sidebar, and using the search function to find other threads about this (yours is at least the third one today!).  Then come back and tell us some relevant details, like how much you want to pay and whether you really need to be on the bus line, so people can help you in a meaningful way.
You can't say that with certainty -- nobody can, because the stats just don't exist yet. It has only been in the last two years that serious efforts have been started to gather national data on what had been treated as a local issue. Meanwhile, there's [this project](http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/how-the-washington-post-is-examining-police-shootings-in-the-us/2015/06/29/f42c10b2-151b-11e5-9518-f9e0a8959f32_story.html).
Before you take the word of the single most negative troll in this subreddit, do yourself a favor and read about Community Festival.   This is the fest that has won so many awards for "best festival in central Ohio" that the paid staff of other fests joke about giving ComFest an all-time award and taking it out of contention just to give others a chance. It's the fest that annually motivates 1,700 volunteers to work for free running six stages with over 250 performances and workshops. It's the organization that gives thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours of labor to keep Goodale Park green and blooming, and leaves the park pristine when the fest is over (unlike virtually every other festival in town). These are the folks who take nothing for themselves but give back profits from the event as grants to dozens of community organizations.   You can read what the organization does,and why, at [the ComFest website](http://comfest.com), and find plenty of praise for the event just by searching for past news coverage. But the best way to learn how wrong the OP is would be to just come on down to this free event next weekend. You can find all the details about transportation, hours, performances, etc in the [2015 Community Festival Program Guide](http://www.comfest.com/program-guide.php), and read about the fest's history in the [40th anniversary commemorative book published in 2012](http://athensmessenger.com/app/emag/ComfestXL/ComfestXL.swf).  EDIT: removed true but tangential statement about OP in order to keep the focus where it belongs.
I didn't say "what they think is the right thing". I said, and meant, the [objectively] right thing -- the action that is sustainable within the ecology of human society.  The point is that most people, psychopaths and sociopaths excepted, are both hard-wired and conditioned to want to be fair and compassionate. When some fail to do this, it's a lack of resources -- material or knowledge -- that causes the problem. The idea that it's only natural to compete is so reductionist as to be completely misleading. When public policy is based on that assumption we get massive wealth inequality and wars to protect the system that made some people so much richer than others.
I'm not objecting to the amount of punishment, but the *kind*: do you want to live in a society where judges can tell reporters to write articles to the judge's specification?   Journalists are watching this to see what the news org will do, and what the editor will do. Both *should* refuse this sentence, but the editor in question is a widely-despised hack and will probably cave.   I have no idea what an appropriate conventional sentence would be. The guy violated a very clear court order, in an egregious manner. And this wasn't for any reason of high principle, just the reflexive race to get a scoop. What do you think?
[Here's a guide to caring for small kittens.](http://www.kittenrescue.org/index.php/cat-care/kitten-care-handbook/) There should be a recipe here for making kitten milk replacer at home until you can get to a pet food store to buy some.  Another thing you should do is look around to see if there are more kittens out there. If the momcat is around, she'll take care of them, but it not you'll have to intercede.  This is a great adventure you've embarked upon. Watch out for falling in love with that little squirt!
Well, shoot: I also write fake news for the purpose of pointing out how gullible some of our colleagues are -- but [only on April Fool's Day.](http://angelamotorman.blogspot.com/2007/04/slow-down-youre-reading-too-fast.html)   I'm thinking that doing this any other day for even the best reason in the world undercuts this guy's claim to be a journalist.
[And this doesn't help.](http://www.boston.com/news/nation/2015/05/01/news-media-won-cover-bernie-sanders-because-news-media-won-cover-bernie-sanders/Fd4VrpGvVqhACVdPuVjOlM/story.html)
In 1985, the strike by meatpackers at Hormel's Austin MN plant, represented by United Food And Commercial Workers Local P-9, was the cause celebre of the labor-oriented left in the US, gaining wide support nationally from everyone to the left of Ronald Reagan. Only a handful of trade unionists and labor activists disagreed with the strategy of the local, which pitted it against the national union as well as the bosses. P-9 supporters were outraged by the criticism, which history has vindicated. The dispute has long-lasting implications for all labor organizing, and deserves the closer look it did not get at the time.  The linked piece was written while the strike was ongoing, but it remains the most complete explanation of the issues. It's a very long read, but the key graf is this one:  The outcome of the struggle between industrial unionism and enterprise unionism will determine the nature of the labor movement in decades to come. Concessions can be won back in later bargaining, as many unions have shown. But a fundamental shift to enterprise unionism will destroy whatever class consciousness still exists in the labor movement.
