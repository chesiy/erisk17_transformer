I wouldn't be shocked if he didn't. John is a weird dude. I think he said when working on Stadium Arcadium he used to listen to 36 chambers by Wu Tang Clan everyday ha

Someone please take this thread down. No good discussion is going to come from it. Just incessant blabbering that people have heard a million times and are desensitizing the issue. I'm not saying we shouldn't talk about it, just this isn't the right forum.
New Anivia Skin, it seems that Riot has made yet another step towards preying on our childhood nostalgia.   New skin is Aerodactyl. Ya' know, the POKEMANS. Not really with how it looks, but you get the gist. Still missing Zapdos and Moltres. Guess we won't get Moltres until Riot finishes that Lava map that has been thrown away for ever. And Zapdos, here's where it gets real. Maybe if Kennen electricutes a prehistoric Anivia and it kills her, making her go into eggnivia, it will hatch as a beautiful Zapdos.  TL;DR People still think dreamily of Pokemon first generation

I can see that, I'm one of the people that thought it was stoner wanna-be's that listened to them. Then I gave them a real look and realized that pink Floyd is beyond all that and I don't associate my fandom with drugs at all
My favorite song hands down off Dark Side, no question about it. Listening to that solo in the right environment is a border line religious experience. Also the lyricism in this song is so superb, and it's genius for them to do the Breathe Reprise, I absolutely love this tune.
As you can see, less than half my artists have had an album come out in 2014, but thats all good. I finally listened to artists that I never really listened to before and I loved them. I might also add youtube links to some songs from these artists :)   * 1) Pink Floyd - knew about them of course, really delved into their material and was blow away, I consider them one of my favorite bands of all-time. I even enjoyed The Endless River, to a certain extent, even though a lot of people didn't as much. I think that album has a time and place, and can't be listened to at any moment like some of their albums   * 2) The Killers - liked them when I was younger, got back into them and I think Sam's Town has aged realllllly well   * 3) Sage Francis - Man did this dude's new album swing hard, wooooo I love his venom   * 4) Modest Mouse - always knew the "hits" but listened to them a bunch more, I really dig the song, "Bankrupt On Selling"  * 5) Gorillaz - listened to the entire Demon Dayz album, and holllly shiiiit, it was gnarly   * 6) Twenty One Pilots - These two dudes have become one of my favorite bands, I think after their 3rd album these guys are gonna explode more than they already have, I'm super looking forward to their next project  * 7) Marina and the Diamonds - I was debating on not putting her on here, primarily because her lyrics aren't great and all that negative connotations that pop music brings, but I'll be damned if I didn't find her so catchy. She's my guilty pleasure - come hate me haha   *  8) St. Vincent - Digital Witnesses is my favorite song off her latest album, it's a fun album for me   * 9) The Naked   Famous - first heard them in FIFA, I totally dig their style and the female singer is something I totally dig  * 10) Atmosphere - Southsiders had it's moments, not the greatest album, I think I enjoyed it more than most Atmosphere fans. Flicker is my favorite song because I'm an Eyedea fan, so I thought it was a great song. I also started listening to his older discog a bit more, and I think Slug can straight spit fire
Copper Gone by Sage Francis, underrated angry rapper that used to be a slam poet, this guy's lyricism is next to none.
Time 3:18-4:45, pretty much just sex on my ears, one day I'm gonna find a nice girl and impregnate her to this solo.
Right down the pisser!
This was posted about a month or so ago and went straight to the top... I see you guy.
Hmm, it was working initially... I even checked since I posted it from mobile to see if the URL was different. But now I'm actually having trouble accessing it too. Might be a disruption on their end.
you're right, as much as it pains me, gotta take it down.
I feel the exact same way man. It's been well documented that the toxicity of the LoL community is pretty great. I see posts all the time about these issues and it happens to me all the time too. I actually almost considered quitting the game entirely because I was amazed at how selfish most players are. Reminding people to be nice to other people, and remember who is actually behind the computer screen doesn't really work. In theory its great, and practical, but its so easy to be angry. So really the only way to make great environments for playing is for riot to take drastic action, and place all the trolls together. But they've already stated that they won't do that, so don't hold your breath for any changes in the ranked environment any time soon. Essentially the only time I feel like I'm in a relaxed environment is when I'm in normals, and the result of the match doesn't really matter to me. So good luck in trying to get out of bronze and thence forward. :)
