Sam Bradford ranked as 'Third Tier' QB
Well, folks, I'm proposing today. Gonna make sure I hit my lifts hard, get a great pump, and go into it with as much confidence as possible. Though I don't think I've ever been more nervous in my life.  EDIT: SHE SAID YES

Oh yes, that was a very well conducted interview. I've always been a fan of her.
I think he did a really great job of sidestepping questions where Katie was trying to get him to take a shot at Hillary. I know that as a reporter it's her job to ask those questions and I don't fault her for that, but I'm proud that he was able to address those questions by keeping the interview about his policy views and his campaign rather than focusing on where another candidate stands. That's the kind of honest, clean campaign that all of Bernie's doubters need to see.

It's ridiculous that a GOP mayor with about 13% of the state's population in his city is smart enough to see that this RFRA is wrong, but none of the GOP state legislators are interested one bit in including LGBT protections language. This is just baffling.

Yea the Pittsburgh interview was when Frank planned the implosion. In Chapter 10 @8:40 Peter and Frank have a heated discussion where Peter tells Frank he isn't afraid of him anymore. The Watershed Bill failed and his people need the jobs he promised them and Frank had better fix it.  The next scene is Doug and Frank discussing accelerating their unspecified plan. Peter's confidence has been built up and they're losing control of him. It's time to put him away. This is the plan to have Rachel seduce Doug the night before a radio interview and get him drunk after being sober for so long. So Frank schedules the interview and tells Peter to be ready and to go to this gala the night before. There, Rachel works her magic at the hotel, and boom goes the dynamite.   Killing Peter was really just a spur of the moment decision by Frank. When they're in the garage, Peter is drunkenly babbling on about needing to come clean about everything that's happened. Well Frank can't have that. Peter wasn't supposed to be a liability after he withdrew from the Governor's race, but clearly he'll always be a thorn in his side. So how do we deal with a perpetual Peter problem? You put him down. Politics.
Well if we looked at the date he wrote the letter to Walker, October 28th, 2014, it looks like literally one week before the real life November 4th, 2014 midterms. The problem is that we don't know the exact date that Walker resigned and when Frank took his oath and assumed office. But since there wasn't any mention of midterm results in Chapter 26, I'm sure the first episode of Season 3 will give us the results.   Regardless, in 2016 we're going to have a situation where President Underwood would have been in office for over two years. Underwood's first "term" started late October/early November 2014. If he gets re-elected in 2016, his second term would start when he's inaugurated in January 2017. So his first term is over two years and if we use a plain meaning rule reading of the 22nd Amendment, it's seems clear that he wouldn't be able to run again in 2020.  But you can be sure he would try to get around that somehow when 2020 comes around (assuming the show is still on the air then).
But why do specific nations have to play against each other in order for it to be a "world" championship? If the best players in the world are playing in this league, why should it matter if it's Denver vs. Seattle or USA vs. South Africa for example?
The first time I heard this song I was 10 years old on a bus trip from Vegas to the Grand Canyon and the bus was playing the movie "Fools Rush In" with Matthew Perry and Salma Hayek. I love the Fallout references, but this song will forever be linked to Matthew Perry knocking up a chick on a one night stand for me.
In case anyone is wondering, this is The Lawn at the University of Virginia.
Does this mean the fire is "white hot"?
