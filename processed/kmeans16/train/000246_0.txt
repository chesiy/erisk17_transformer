Speaking as someone who lives in California there a few things you/she need to know. Yes, everything here is much more expensive. I live in the south Bay region and pay around $860 a month for a studio apartment. Fairly big enough but still. Also, there are good areas (redondo beach, marina del Rey, Irvine, Glendale) and there are bad areas (LA, Compton, Hollywood). Moving here won't give you any more opportunities unless you already have your foot in the door. If you have already been talking to some of these companies and are interested in giving you a job, go for it. But if you come here looking for a job you will probably fail. LA is full of people hoping to "make it" and only around 13 percent actually succeed. Look at your current circumstances and decide if that's the best decision for you.

It's alright. You might want to check out some prov videos though and see what really good looks like. Might I suggest NachoTHPS and then click on links from there.
Google Thugpro. You're welcome.
I remember Create-a-review. That's was the place for the community! I remember hanging out with the Tho guys. Tek was really cool.

I apologize in advance if someone has already posted this (I didn't read all the comments :/). But he strikingly resembles his own master (Ben kenobi). Foreshadowing?
The same goes with video games? Do you play them in chronological order or when they were made? Example:Kingdom Hearts or Metroid?
He must be writing the trombone part
