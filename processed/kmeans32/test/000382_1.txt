No problem. Happy I could clarify for you
Well if you are married and you already have a previously communicated understanding that "if we get tipsy, it's cool to have sex still" then obviously that wouldn't be rape. You have a trust with that person, you've talked about it while sober before getting drunk, and you both know if you don't want to you can say something before drinking and nothing will happen. But most of the time when people talk about drunk sex and consent, the idea is that if you DON'T have a previous (sober) understanding and you come on to someone who's really drunk or they come on to you, they can't really consent at that point and you shouldn't have sex.
Fyi, asexual =/= no libido. Just say no libido. But you're right, the sudden drop is somewhat abnormal and talking to a gyno would probably be a good idea. Depending on where you live you might not need parental approval for an appointment - some states in the U.S. allow you to go doctors at 16 without parental permission. You can always call a local gyno and ask if you need permission from your mom to make an appointment. If not, then you're golden. If you do, you might be able to at least just talk to one over the phone about your problem.
I have PTSD from childhood abuse, and I know how badly it can fuck up your life. It really sounds like you need to talk to your therapist about all this stuff, but if you feel like regular sessions aren't enough you can also reach out in other ways for help.   There are lots of crisis hotlines, support groups, etc. for victims of sexual violence, as well as people with PTSD. You should look online for local organizations like that. A good support group can be a great supplement to individual therapy. It really helps to know you aren't the only one going through something like that.   Also, you mentioned that you and your boyfriend broke up because of your emotional changes and behavior after the trauma. I know you feel like you screwed up that relationship forever, but if you never told him what happened to you then obviously he wouldn't understand what's going on. It can be ready hard to confide in someone about traumatic events, but it might do you some good to come clean to him. Even if you don't get back together, it might help you both get some mutual understanding about what was happening. I'm sure he noticed something wasn't right, and if he knew the reason why you suddenly changed he would probably be more willing to let go of all that.  Another serious thing you should consider is how you're self-medicating with alcohol. I'm sure you don't need me to tell you this is bad. It's tempting to try to drink until you forget, but trust me, this doesn't work. You need to find healthier ways to deal with this stuff. Maybe consider going to AA to help deal with this problem.   Finally, I just want you to know that what happened to you wasn't your fault and your reaction is totally normal. You didn't deserve to be assaulted, and everything you described - from the way you reacted when it was happening to the turmoil it left you in up until now - is actually super common for people who go through stuff like this. I sincerely hope you can learn to love yourself and open up to others again and that you get the help you need. If you want, feel free to PM me to talk about whatever.
I'm not from Michigan, but the US south. It sucks here for queer people 95% of the time, basically. In my state, for the longest time only one city - the city I currently live in - had a comprehensive nondiscrimination policy. Currently, that number has grown ... to eight cities. Eight cities in an entire fucking state have passed laws so I won't be fired or evicted if someone finds out I'm non-binary. Yeah.  Oh, and even in this, the relatively tolerant city, I have regularly had people harass me on the street because I'm visibly queer. My roommate had people try to grope, harass, or even sexually proposition him so frequently he was afraid to ride public transportation or walk home alone. He's trans. And don't get me started on things my family, former friends, and ex-church pastor have said about the LGBTQ community.
Thanks!
I used to shave, not really often but I hated it. I prefer to use trimmers to keep it manageable and easier to clean my vulva. But otherwise I don't worry about pubic hair. Anyone who claims hairy genitals are disgusting is just being immature. Pubic hair is healthy - it's there for a fucking reason. There is nothing wrong with it.  (Not to say that people who do shave/wax/etc. should be ashamed of doing so, it's your choice so do whatever makes you feel good.)  My routine now is give it a trim about every 3 weeks or so. That way it's not too out of control, but I also don't have to worry about razor burn, cuts, etc. and it's not at all painful.
That's good. Even if someone shouldn't associate with a friend, family member, or partner anymore trying to push them into it can just make things worse. They might stubbornly refuse just because they don't want to feel like they were forced into it, or out might stress them out if they aren't ready.   Also I should probably clarify that I wasn't trying to get down in you or anything, it's just a really serious topic so I felt like I should give some weight to it.   There most likely will be a tough transition period right after your boyfriend moves out. People like his dad tend not to respect boundaries and can really freak out whenever you start enforcing them. So be ready for that. But ultimately moving out will probably make him feel a lot better so there's still something to look forward to!  All that aside, your boyfriend is lucky to have you to support him through this and I hope you guys make it through okay. Give him my well-wishes and all the best to both of you!
I've been really fortunate in that both my partners are very understanding about it. But not everyone is accepting, so it can be scary. Hopefully though you can gain more confidence and have a successful relationship in the future, of that's something you want. Also, if you haven't already you should check out /r/asexuality.  Edit: I realized I didn't really answer your question. Most people I tell have never heard of any of this stuff, so my standard coming out experience is 20-30 minutes of explaining how asexuality works. It's a difficult concept for some people to grasp, for sure. I imagine it's a lot like telling people you grew up in a foreign country very different from theirs - people tend to have a lot of questions about how it works.
What exactly is adult taste strawberry?
I've heard good things about Origins, never been though.  I totally understand why those scenes would be off-putting. Honestly the Dany/Drogo scene was a really terrible one. The show changes a lot of the romance scenes purely for shock value and ratings, which I hate so much. I basically just watch the show for Tyrion, Arya, and Brienne. I like the books a lot more, too.  I've been playing through quite a few VNs lately. Some of my favorites are Katawa Shoujo, Higurashi, and Dangan Ronpa. If you haven't played them, Katawa Shoujo is free, and Dangan Ronpa came out for PSP (and the sequel is on the Vita). Higurashi is a little harder to find, and is a bit expensive pretty much anywhere you do find it, unfortunately.
Well if you're looking for larps near you, I figured there would be plenty in San Antonio. /shrug/  Anyway, I'm currently playing Dystopia Rising (a great post-apocalypse larp) and the Texas location is in Belton, which should be a little over two hours away for you. I know the people from there are all pretty awesome, so if it sounds like your sort of thing you should check it out. They meet up one weekend a month.
Yeah, I'd say that a Spidey vs. Bats fight would probably go the same way a lot of Batman fights go - he loses initially, then goes off to the cave to regroup. There, he makes a new gadget and/or comes up with a new strategy, and in the next fight he creams them.  This is why Batman is ultimately better, at least imo. What makes him a fearsome opponent isn't that he wins all his fights all or even most of the time. What's terrifying about him is that he has such dogged tenacity. In fact, I'd argue that obsessive determination is Bruce Wayne's superpower.
I kinda wish they hadn't gone that route, though. You still got some of it in the books, but it seems like the show is placing a lot more emphasis on "Shae betrays Tyrion out of jealousy." In the books, though, I like to think it was all about money from the get-go. Like the scene with Littlefinger talking about how a good whore will make a man think that she is enjoying herself despite her expectations, I feel like book-Shae was just making Tyrion think that she fell in love with him despite herself but wanted his money and status the whole time.  Also, I think that this motivation is more in line with Tyrion's motivation; its basically the inverse of his first marriage. It makes his rage a lot more justifiable if he wasn't merely betrayed, but felt like he was lied to from the beginning. Finding out that Shae betrayed him out of jealousy would put at least some of the blame on him for not properly maintaining their relationship - it was a problem he could have potentially amended. But if she never loved him to begin with, it is yet another example of how the universe has fucked him over and he never had a chance because he's a dwarf. And that seems to be the recurring theme with all of his issues - I can't get anyone to love me because all they see is a dwarf.
Porque no los dos?
Unfortunately :/
Well I can't definitively tell you because I'm not the writer, but the implication is that Hanji is not male or female but rather gender neutral. How it might be important to the plot or character I can't say because again, I'm not the one writing it. Maybe the author just felt like having a nonbinary person in their comic. And it certainly can work in English, although it is slightly more difficult to do than in Japanese it is possible. There are ways to write around it, the easiest to just refer to Hanji as "they" instead of "he" or "she."
Wow. A lot of that is seriously unnecessary rudeness. It's like militant atheists who tell anyone who follows a religion that they're "backward" or stupid or whatever. People have different preferences; the whole idea of fighting for queer rights is that EVERYONE should be able to express their gender identity or orientation freely. Of course ces/het people already have that freedom, but that doesn't mean that they're wrong for being the way they are any more than queer people are for being the way they are.  Speaking as a queer/poly woman, I can definitely say that if someone said the same comments to me every time I commented on a man's appearance or something like that I would be pissed. There is no one "right" way to be attracted to people. Saying things like "maybe you do have something correct in you after all" is super fucked up, because that implies that only certain sexualities are "right" and everything else is "wrong." NOPE sorry try again.  As for the whole idea of berating someone for being monogamous, I personally believe that people aren't necessarily monogamous by nature. But just like sexual orientation, that doesn't mean that everyone is a certain way. I have lots of friends who are monogamous and in relationships and they could never imagine themselves living any other way. *And that's fine.* There is nothing inherently wrong with wanting to have only one partner, the problems only start when you try to force your viewpoint on other people. Saying that everyone should be poly and that monogamy is unnatural is like saying that everyone has to like Neapolitan ice cream. What if you're fine with just vanilla, or only chocolate? That doesn't make you wrong, or a horrible person. It just means you have different tastes. Just don't try to keep anyone else from having Neapolitan, and everything should be good.
LE GASP~~~ I don't believe it!!
I'm mostly happy with who I am too, it's just the occasional nagging in the back of my brain. But it's about the same as other people thinking things like "If only I could shed a few pounds" or "If only I were good at sports" etc.
Yeah. I'm sure it's actually really common (especially if you're poly). Right now I'm in a committed relationship with my SO whom I've been dating for over five years, but I also have feelings for a girl I've been friends with since high school.
In society women are treated as if their only important functions are to be a sex object or bear children. Otherwise, we don't matter. Just because a guy isn't attracted to women doesn't mean he thinks any better of them than a straight man.  Fortunately, though, at least some of them seem to be cluing into this and I've seen a lot of gay men speaking up about their own misogyny and how to end it.
Wow, that is kind of a shitty situation. And you're right, it's not really anyone's fault, it just sorta happened.  If it were me I probably wouldn't tell Ann just because if she doesn't really need to know I can't see a reason to make her upset too. But other than that I would definitely try to just move on and do better next time. It seems like Beth understands that you wouldn't purposefully do something that would make her uncomfortable and you wouldn't have done it had you known she was awake. So yeah, icky feelings and all that but you can't change the past, you can only try to do better and not make the same mistake again in the future.  My suggestion would be that if you are going to have Ann over again would be to perhaps find a way for Beth to stay somewhere else (go visit a friend or family maybe) or perhaps invest in a pair of ear plugs.
Wow, that's so awesome! I'm glad that everyone at your work seems to be cool with it all, and that your mom is supporting you too! I hope things go well with your life from now on, and good luck! :
As far as the kids thing goes, it's not impossible. I don't know how adoption laws work in the UK but that seems like a pretty viable option. Of course if you wanted your own biological child and had some money you could use a donor egg and surrogate mom. So you should tell your mom that grandkids aren't completely out of the picture.  On the other hand, you still have the issue that same sex relationships "make her feel ill." Honestly, this is kind of silly, but a lot of straight people have the homophobic tendency to be a little squeamish about gay couples. Hopefully, though, she'll get over it with time, especially if she realizes that there really isn't a reason to be squeamish and if she sees you being happy in a relationship.  A support group would probably be a good idea for your parents, or at least your mom. Again, I don't live in the UK so I don't know any specifics, but you should try searching on the internet for an LGBTQ organization in your area. They can likely help you out with finding resources for your parents, possibly a support group, or even just talking to them - they're probably more practiced at it than you are and they might be able to give your parents some perspective. Plus, it always helps to hear it from multiple people.  Other than that, just keep doing what you've been doing. Answer their questions and show them you love them. Your parents seem like they're just worried about you, but once they get used to the fact that you're gay they probably won't worry as much about it.  I hope that helps, and good luck!
Thanks for the link! It's a pretty good one.  I really like that the speaker brought up the blog quotes talking about how just because you're not trying to get in a woman's pants doesn't automatically make you a feminist. I've talked to so many women who have had gay guys critically comment on their appearance, touch or grope their bodies without permission, etc. but when they tell them no the man will respond "oh, it's okay, I'm gay, it's not like I want to have sex with you."   Seriously, just because you aren't physically attracted to someone doesn't mean it's okay for you to say that they're ugly, or tell them their genitals are nasty, or to fondle their breasts or ass. That shit is not cool.
To answer your initial question, no, being transexual does not mean you have the sexuality of the opposite sex. It means that your gender does not align with your physiological sex. Those are two very different things.  If you feel like you should have a vagina or breasts or that you are too hairy, etc. that is called gender dysphoria. You feel like the current state of your body doesn't quite match up with what should be there, right? I'd say that's a pretty big sign you're trans. Of course, you should probably talk to a queer-friendly counselor about this - they can help you better understand those feelings and you can discuss the possibility of transitioning with them.  As far as having a lot in common with gay men, I don't see anything particularly wrong with that. Personally, I'm female but I usually relate a lot more easily to guys because I'm fairly masculine. That doesn't invalidate my womanhood or identity. You're allowed to like what you like - no two women are the same, and there is no one "right" way to be female. Plus, peeing standing up is a pretty useful skill, especially if you don't have a toilet handy while camping or what have you.  So don't worry too much about that sort of thing! I hope that clears some things up for you, and I hope that you figure out your identity and find happiness in the future.
Um ... yes, it is.
Well I know I definitely enjoyed it the first time around, no matter what other people seem to think of it. It was really fun seeing how certain characters thought and felt that weren't given a lot of POV parts before, as well as giving more/new perspective for characters that we've already seen a lot of. This is the book that really cemented my liking Jaime Lannister. It might not have huge battles or massive plots but imho it had just as many emotionally charged scenes that really gave you a connection to the characters. And what's the point of having epic battles if you don't care about any of the participants? Why should I care who comes into power if I don't have any investment in the people I'm reading about? If you ask me, without those sorts of scenes the action-packed bits would be a lot less meaningful or exciting.  Oh, and I'm definitely looking forward to finishing the series so that I can finally start looking into all the conspiracy theories and whatnot. And then I'll read them all again and look for prophecies and foreshadowing. It will be a lot of fun!
No problem! I hope you find it as useful as I did.
I made this using a 16" pillow form and some worsted weight yarn. For the body of the pillow I just crocheted a circle and made increases and decreases as necessary to fit the pillow shape. For the legs, arms, and head I free-handed all of it. It's super soft and comfy, and I got a yarn that's machine washable and dryable so it's pretty kid-friendly too. If you guys have any questions I'd love to answer them!  Edit: Wow! So many people want patterns. Okay, I will definitely be writing that out later tonight or tomorrow, whenever I have time. I'll probably charge for the pattern, though - does $5 sound fair?
Seriously, I don't understand you. All I wanted to do was talk about something I like with other people who like it too. Instead, I get an outcry about why I don't belong here because I haven't finished the books *even though the rules of the subreddit state this is perfectly okay.* When people try to tell me that I might get spoiled I respond by saying it shouldn't be an issue as long as everyone follows the rules, and that I'll take my chances because I came here to have fun and participate in discussion.  So instead of letting it go, you insist that I'm a dick for wanting to be here and now you're going to do the EXACT THING that you and everyone else has been warning me about? Self-fulfilling prophecy much? But apparently I'm still the dick. Whatever dude, seems like you're the one with the problem here, not me - I've had plenty of good discussion and pleasant exchanges with other people on this thread and in this sub in general. Right now you're the only one who is acting like a stubborn dick, really.
