/u/xenmate indicated in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/MoviePosterPorn/comments/2ffzpt/300_2006_650_867_by_tomer_hanuka/ck95l4i) that they contacted the mods and confirmed that a poster can be flaired as "official" if it's licensed. So, pretty much anything made for Mondo can be flaired as "official" in this sub.

Even if you take the pitbull stats and cut them in half- they are still by far the most dangerous breed  You make a valid point but seem to forget that this is not statistically how relative dangerousness is calculated in risk assessment. Here's how it's explained by the CDC in their [2000 report](http://www.cdc.gov/homeandrecreationalsafety/images/dogbreeds-a.pdf) concerning dog bite-related fatalities:   Ideally, breed-specific bite rates would be calculated to compare breeds and quantify the relative dangerousness of each breed. For example, 10 fatal attacks by Breed X relative to a population of 10,000 Xs (1/1,000) implies a greater risk than 100 attacks by Breed Y relative to a population of 1,000,000 Ys (0.1/1,000). Without consideration of the population sizes, Breed Y would be perceived to be the more dangerous breed on the basis of the number of fatalities.  When fatality *rates* are considered in a more statistically rigorous manner than simple fatality *numbers*, it could be argued that other breeds might be more dangerous than pit bulls (which just so happens to be the conclusion of the 2000 CDC report).
The reference that you cite is from the 14th paragraph of the article and is preceded by information obtained from other sources (2008 TED talk, 2011 documentary, etc.). Moreover, the reference does not meet the recency requirement that [the research linked to should be within the past 6 months (or so)](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/wiki/rules#wiki_submission_rules). I could not find any reference in the article that was more recent than 2013.
