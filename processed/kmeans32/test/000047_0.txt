The Angels have won 9 of their past 10 and 5 straight. The bats have finally clicked into place and this team can't keep track of how many they've scored. All year lineup depth has been killing us, but the bottom half guys (Aybar, Freese, Iannetta, Joyce even) have started to hit like they're capable of, and all the sudden we've taken flight. The pitching has been excellent. The Astros are cooling off, and we're only 1.5 back.   It's really nice to start playing like we're capable of.

I'm being pedantic? You have given literally zero evidence that such a phenomenon exists, other than cherrypicked anecdotes...which I suppose puts you on the cutting edge of clutch apologists, so congrats on that.  If you just haven't read the stuff, by all means, here's a good place to start: http://www.fangraphs.com/library/considering-high-leverage-performance-and-clutch-hitting/  But, I can't convince you of anything if you're not willing to be convinced.
Yeah that's what I mean by don't disbelieve. Just because the info can't be verified on an anonymous internet forum doesn't mean it's not accurate. Like you said, stuff does break on here every so often. Just like my heart right now.

There's people in the college game who we look at as physical monsters, who are able to assert absolute physical dominance at the college level, simply because they are upperclassmen who are grown ass men now. Not very many of these guys make an impact in the NBA; much of their effectiveness in college is in their physicality.  Now take someone who's actually good enough to be in the NBA, and is a contributor, and on top of that is fully mature physically, and works out for a living.  95% of NBA starters would be able to drag an awful team to the tournament. If they land on a team like Seattle or Florida Gulf Coast, as was suggested, they'd be in title contention. I love college hoops, but there's some serious overestimation of the college game in here right now.
My guess is they worked something out with him beforehand to pay him less than the minimum first round contract, a la Josh Huestis with OKC last year. Lot of teams hate having end of the first round picks, cuz they're guaranteed millions but the quality of player isn't as high, so they try to work around it.  I don't like it, but I'd be surprised if this was anything else.
I think I probably used wording that was a bit too strong when I said "to a T". I also think you make a good point regarding his hesitancy to give young guys at bats; if I had anything to change about his style, it would be that. But I also think he deserves credit for working guys like Kole into the lineup quickly.  Ultimately, I spoke a little too strongly about his team management. I do believe that he does a good job getting out of the way of the team, and promoting an atmosphere that allows them to handle the clubhouse as they see fit. Lately, we've had players on our roster who prefer to go about their business individually, and we've seen that on the roster. But it's been far from a toxic environment.
For sure, doesn't come off as sarcasm in the initial post. All good my friend
Seriously though :(
I guess I replied sloppily, my bad. I didn't mean we shouldn't be getting more than we have been (you're right, we're down), we just shouldn't be getting much more. This area isn't supposed to get much rain, and that's what I read you as saying.   Weave's velocity has been on the way down for a few years now, but at the beginning of this year his fastball dropped all the way down to 83-84, and he's gotten thrashed a couple of times. He said himself he felt like he was throwing BP on the mound. That being said, he's a gamer if I've ever seen one, and I still have faith in him. He threw a complete game shutout against the Astros his last time out. It'll be interesting to see if he can produce for us. Even though he started Opening Day again for us this year, realistically, he's our #3 at best.
Ouch. I saw something about how you guys were really lucky in 1 run games last year, so paying the piper I guess :/  Still, it has sucked to have Zobrist out I'm sure. And Doolittle being on the DL can't have helped your bullpen.
I picked up *Disgrace* by J.M. Coetzee at a thrift store with no expectations, and it really delivered. A haunting look at a man growing old and realizing he never really figured much of anything out. Devestating, and incredible. Read it in a couple of days.  *A Prayer For Owen Meany* also got me. The novel inhabits such a weird but wonderful (in a weird way of course) world.
[Tongariro by Milorad Pejic.](https://www.guernicamag.com/poetry/tongariro/)  Wish he was more widely available in English.
You mean lowest
Jon Krakauer is awesome. He really drives at the intersection between modern humanity and nature in a lot of his writing I think.  John Muir's writing is incredible too. *My First Summer in the Sierras* in particular comes to mind.
Oh I just hate Aoki cuz of his catches in Game 2. Both of them were miracles and he taunted our crowd after both. Which I'd love against anyone but my team and now hate him for
I have them in the Elite 8. It's not an easy road at all, but they have the best player in the regional in Kris Dunn. That's a damn useful thing
I'm not really buying the haven't faced an elite team deal.   Wisconsin has played one elite team, Duke, who they lost to at home in a great game.   Kentucky has played one elite team, Kansas, who they eviscerated before Kansas had really figured out how to play together.   Virginia lost to Duke at home in a great game.   Duke won at Virginia and at Wisconsin, easily the best two wins this season, but also lost to/played close games against teams much their inferior.   Arizona played one, a home win against Gonzaga in OT. Gonzaga obviously played the same one.  Each of these teams, with the exception of Duke, has 1 elite game. Which half of them lost. Why does that all the sudden make them head and shoulders above Villanova?
You should be stoked, it's the coolest thing ever. I went for the first time last year and I had sky-high expectations, and it shattered them
Which would be one of the greatest things of all time, cuz he'd have approximately 97 points
Enjoy the Madness!
There's a certain amount of this here too:  http://dc243.4shared.com/img/0-YPtbQE/s7/13eee3b8430/introduce_a_little_anarchy
Thanks! I love me some college hoops haha, and I follow it all year. This is like Christmas for me.  Oh I love Arkansas, also just have a gut feeling about Wofford haha. I also think they have a tendency to get a little out of control, and that can hurt them if they find the game close and Wofford hits some shots.  I'd probably have taken Cincy over any other 8/9 seed, but Purdue is playing well right now, and I think Cincy is realllly gonna struggle to score. But they've had a fantastic year given everything they've gone through.
Not saying they can't do it, saying that the Sweet 16 at the very least is a tall order. When you say you don't expect to make it that far, but then that you expect to make it further than 75% of the teams in the tournament, it's a confusing contradiction haha.  I was lucky enough to be at both of the Arizona-SDSU games last year (I'm a UCSD alum haha, I live in the area), they were both fantastic atmospheres and fantastic games.
Yes yes so much yes
Yesss it's a beautiful thing. Our finals week was always the first week of the tournament...which sounds awful. But then take into consideration that I never had a final later than Tuesday afternoon for those quarters = I'm free all week to watch all the games, plus Spring Break the week after. It was pretty much perfect haha
Oh, SDSU too.
