So excited
Basically it is saying that it won't be a typical hero movie.  It is not exactly a big deal, but a huge sigh of relief to get confirmation that the movie is on the right track.  Either way I highly suggest picking up a volume or two of Sandman. Few rarely regret it.
So who was the one cheating in relation to Jupiter's Legacy?
I could be wrong, but this is not the right meme for that.
Well the Mark got zapped up into the sky after leaving Dean. When then see the same zaps hitting the earth where the Darkness escapes from.  Not to mention the Mark was said to be both a lock and a key, so I figure it is gone until being recast.   Rowenna probably just used her time to read other parts of the book to power up.
You are right. We need more Captain Carrot.

TFW "way back" is 2011. . .
August?
It did sort of have a set up for Justice League 3000. We get the explanation of how Cadmus is having DNA of most Superhumans.
A decent setup of what is to come.
Google Play is having a $2.99 sale for Woman-lead comic books, including Batgirl, Supergirl, Batwoman, Wonder Woman, World's Finest (All N52 Vol 1's) and Death: Deluxe Edition (My personal favorite).
I thought she did well in it, but figured it was inevitable.
Well, we are just 15 years from the next 30's. It may just be time to bring it back.
If you can find the album at walmart it will be the clean version. Thats wherr I bought it back in Jr. high amd was promptly disappointed. However going back the the Speakerboxx edited version, it is pretty funny. My copy of Lovr Below was stolen for some reason. . .
On 5, my friend wanted to get high for the first time. So we made a night out of it. He wasn't sure if he was feeling it so I put on Justice Cross over a decent pair of gaming headphones. The moment Genesis started he knew he was high and loved the album even more than before.  On 9, sometimes you might not know you are susceptible to Cannabis-induced Psychosis until it is too late. Know your family's medical history, folks. I used to be a heavy smoker and now I can barely be in the same room as someone smoking.
Dragon Quest 3 has a quick save slot so you can do spurts of grinding when you have the time during the day. This is the only Dragon Quest game where you can decide the class od your party members, so the options of how you want to play is excellent.
Well the Annotated Sandman vol. 3 recently came out, so you could get the penultimate set for just ~70$   I suggest Sword of Scorcery Vol. 1: Amethyst, it is New52, but is fully contained in just this trade and was an excellent read. I really enjoyed All Star Western and coming up this next week or two I believe Animal Man's final trade (vol 5) comes out, so you could get the whole run in one go and have one free book to spare.  Batman Earth One was a really good read, along with Black Mirror and Noel.  For Vertigo, I really liked Spaceman by Brian Azzarello and the Deluxe edition has a nice hardcover on it. The Death Deluxe trade is also a nice collection about that particular Endless member. 100 Bullets just got Book One released (kinda like multiple trades in one).  Of course, if you can afford it, I'd go for the various Event Omnibuses that are out there.  All in all, make sure you compare final costs to other discount sites like instocktrades, since occassionally the other sites will still be cheaper.   I personally been needing to get caught up on GLs and the Flash and this sale is gonna help me out
Anyone keeping up with Hellraiser: Bestiary or Nightbreed? Nightbreed feels like a Mature version of Inhuman and I like it. Also in the issue two of Bestiary, I thought the story with the cube opening being streamed online was a fun little short.
My main LCS had a closing clearance where they had their entire stock at 50% for cash. I got from them Gaiman's Black Orchid, New 52 Flash vol. 1, HC Batman: Earth One (can't wait for next May to continue it), a Venom Might Paper Wallet, New 52 Redhood and the Outlaws vol. 4, and Larfleeze Vol. 1. I would have got some various Green Latern trades but I was between paydays and short on cash.  At my new main LCS I found a Mint New 52 Static Shock for retail price, which is a steal compared to Amazon and considering getting their other copy as an investment.
I think I busted in her during round one a little bit, before pull out. But during round two and three I pulled out fast enough....I think. Don't judge me it was my first time and no babies 16 months later.  I saved a near-nude pic my college roommate's girlfriend had on Facebook for no longer than a minute at like 5 in the morning. No I wasnt just going through her page. It just showed up on the frontpage, of course I saved it, but then a minute later, as I was contemplating hitting Like, it was gone. Right place at the right time I guess.
Empire Ants by The Gorillaz. Every time I listen to it, I get chills.
I pay 42$/month for 1.5 MBPS from ATandT. I've talked to them and that is the fastest physically possible for my address.
I thoroughly enjoyed The Lords of Salem.
I prefer the N52 Red Robin costume to the old one, but of course I first saw him in N52 before I read anything older so I kight just be biased.
I kinda wish he was like the Vertigo Lucifer, but how would they have pulled off Mazikeen. â•®(â•¯â–½â•°)â•­
I started late with my **Justice League 3000** pulls so I just got the first two last week (a local LCS wanted $20 a piece so did Midtown for reg. Price) and read all 8 just the other day. It is an interesting story and how it ties in to Future's End is interesting when they mentioned they have 97% of all metahuman DNA from the island 1000 years ago. Happy to be current on it.  Ordered Outcast #1 from Image with those two, since it sold out everywhere I looked. Decent take on Exorcisms and looking forward to the explanation of his blood burning the possesed.  Read through the other day the Batman Manga Death Mask. It was an interesting story with a little background of Bruce in Japan.  Currently working on the first Hellblazer arc in Original Sins TP and enjoying it so far.
65% off Select DC trades- InStockTrades is having a second wave of 65% off select trades and collections.
Just updated to HTC Sense 6.0 on my M7 and have a couple issues.   Everything is green. Like the letters on the keyboard when I type, the loading bar in the internet browser, and who knows what else. I tried changing the theme to all black option, but that only fixed the HTC news reading list.  Is there some way to change it?
. . .And?
