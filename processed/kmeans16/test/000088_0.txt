unfortunately all you still have is likely conjecture.  A lot of redditors will recognize this, you see a title for an article and your brain, all on its own, invents the wittiest and funniest thing ever.. you click on comments and find it is the top post already. There is 7 billion of us, a lot of thoughts happen independently in many minds, there have even been noted scientific discoveries that happened simultaneously without the two knowing about each other.  but 'life court' tends to not need absolute scientific level proof and your evidence is strong, just remember though, with 99.9% certainty, there is still a 0.1% chance you are wrong. :)
why is this spun ass political horseshit here?  Thats not at all what the 'scientists predict'  Yes some solar scientist do predict a drastic reduction in solar activity and yes  the last time the earth saw this low of solar activity was during the "mini ice age"  which was mainly limited to europe, even the americas while colder wherent in an ice age and the southern poles seemed to completely miss it...and thats where the truth leaves the barn in this article. Sunspot activitiy only mildly effects climate at most.. they have one single event that was highly localized that correlated to a time of almost no spots.. one event.. gee.  AND NO THE SCIENTISTS are not PREDICTING another mini ice age.  So why does this horse shit news article say they do? just like the horse shit article in the telegraph? Because it fuels the denialism. Fuck people you can have your crappy journalism, but at least get the fucking basics right. No one fucking predicted no god damn ice age.  **NO some political fucking rag, looked at some scientists data, and decided they were going to be arm chair 'scientists'' er denialists and decided to interpret the shit for themselves, and then tell everyone thats what the scientists said.**  This has no business being here. Its denialist horse shit.
the best i can conjecture..  No misleading claims. Posts that omit essential information, or present unrelated facts in a way that suggest a connection will be removed.  not that he was suggesting this is science, or mislead, but my guess is they removed for the "suggestion" that this would happen all the time with men versus women rather than this particular group, without the scientific backing of such a statement.   so basically his til was "there was a cool episode to this show".. i'm a bit on the fence of the removal as many found it interesting but i guess i can see where they think the title is suggestive of a truism when its not really misleading beyond people ignorant on how science works.
yeah i searched all over for that quote.. embiggened the text and all and then watched the video and sighed.  He was definitely in the wrong. 100% supporter of gay rights, but i like my government to be cold hard generic, and they tend not to be already but in the other direction.  They have no business promoting any point of view.  and i could see someone saying that, but i would like to hear it for myself, or see the quote, most likely if it did happen, they were just being a snarky ass. But to me it just sounded like he was belittling the complaint, when the town had a very reasonable objection... for a change.
Its such a beneficial adaptation to recognize the calls of other species and you see it so much on land, and many whales have such wide ranges of hearing frequencies, it would be hard to believe that its not extremely likely that most whales would recognize certain sounds from other species, be it threats, or similar foods. this is askscience and science doesnt care about feelings but it feels like it almost has to arise in creatures with hearing, as the first ones that do it, can eat more, and die less, which is a hallmark of survival. And I dont know the science of it in us or really much more than the basics on evolution, but it seems like we instinctively recognize a lot of sounds animals make. especially when it comes to threat or hurt sounds. First time i heard a gator hiss at me, i knew it was mad. you dont really need to learn the sound cats make when they are fighting. and they tend to be similar, most hurt sounds seem higher pitched. and i know my dog would react to the sounds of cats fighting and you use hurt animal sounds to lure in preying animals. Well i guess the question for me then is, are there hearing land animals we know of that dont react to the calls of other species
they shit sugar. "[honeydew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeydew_(secretion\))"  neem oil can help if you want to be green.  systemic insecticide tends to be better if you just want to lay down the wrath of god.   and yeah [aphids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphid) for sure.
how do you even know?  My problem with this thread, is sometimes I DISAGREE with the witch hunts. No I am not a premium and yes perk can suck balls, but so can the kids in this subreddit who pull out the pitchforks for anything and everything, real or not. And I fear this cries of premium users will just be used to say "no i am not being unreasonable or stupid.. its just premiums downvoting me"   For example, for a while in the start people were screaming that you got banned if you only watched app trailers. It even became part of hte faq.. dont just watch app trailers or get banned. IT WAS TOTAL BULLSHIT.. but try to explain that at that time and you would have been downvoted into oblivion. We had a similar thing happen recently where suddenly people thought you would get banned from perk pop quiz if you turned on lightning mode and left it unattended. THIS IS ALSO BS.. if they wanted to stop that all they needed was a next button after a set of questions. ITs not hard. it wouldnt cost a lot of money or programming.. its like 3 fucking lines in java.  I still use perk.. i still enjoy the cards, yess i get less than i used to but they are still the best beer money app right now for people who want totally passive earnings. and no i am not a preium saying how fucking awesome they are.. thats just a fact.  edit figured on the downvotes.. teh age range of this subreddit is so retarded. sorry if i dont say perk is hitler on a daily basis.
really?  one you can undo, if it turns out you are wrong, one you cant.  thats pretty compelling.  for all our punishments.  there is also the psychological aspect, where as if your government can find reasons to kill that arent due to self defence, then so can you. if the government can kill someone because they think they are a shitty human, so can you.  not saying all murderers would see this and say.. wow i'm not going to kill that dude.. but it does appear to influence society temperament.
it wouldnt matter if it was when he sucked hitlers dick.  the comment is about a president giving an eloquent fuck you to his detractors. the guy posting it doesnt even say he is a supporter.   it doesnt have to do with politics as much as kick ass fuck you'n  and yeah a lot of the left was fucked up and bigoted as fuck before the civil rights era.. tell me do we have to discount all of history and say absolutely and none of it was good until say after the  race riots of the 60s? fuck back then republicans were the anti bigots.. now the head of the republican party in the house(not the speaker but the lead of the party) was a speaker at a white supremacist group which he claims was a different meeting held at the same time and place with the same people but on different subjects.  anyways lets get back to beautiful fuck yous.  like i said the GOP used to be the anti bigots.. maybe you can find a famous GOPr like lincoln or something telling the bigots off eloquently. I'll upvote that shit. Or fuck, idk, it could be bush jr, who i hate, if you find a good speech, and i agree it was a good fuck you.. Up votes are heading your way
It also doesnt matter that much.  there are rich people that lobby for higher taxes and yet still pay the rate it is today.  you can complain about the communication laws, trying to oppen the system up more, while being part of it.. like tmobile did some with tower sharing   you can claim walmart is killing the place without doubling your employees pay and trying to compete with your much smaller buying power.  its not necessarily hypocritical.. and yeah it is a bit different if it is a advocacy group but like people mentioned, it goes up to 15 quickly.  and you can be a smoker and advocate stricker laws, the big hypocrisy happens when you dont let people know you are a smoker as well and instead get caught
That one was a bit overly obvious, i thought, for the show. And for no one to be suspicious. Everyone thought it was her that sent the necklace threat. She has the poison troop. She doesnt even want to drink with the lannisters.. And suddenly she has to give her a massive and firm kiss to the lips? and in the world of deceit they live in... idk if a crazy person who seems like they hate me and sent a threat that they might have me killed.. suddenly kisses me.. i'd be a bit wary.
and they are about to get sued and lose, after spending millions to defend a losing suit.  yes both sides do it.. and i would like to see a study about how much we spend on these stupid laws that are nothing more than an expensive ass tax payers ad for the asshole who passed them. I am quite sure he was told by intelligent advisors that this law would not survive a scotus challenge but was probably also told that this would be good for him politically, both passing the law and when the law is challenged and he can scream about activists courts.  like my state is pouring money in the gay marriage fight, despite half the US lost that same fight before us.  Jindal knew he was lying through his teeth about the purpose.  Jindal also knows it is totally unconstitutional.
Its generally not accepted at all, and if you see the people pushing the idea, you will find they are the same names that the denialist blogs promote and if you look they dont really have anything but conjecture behind their beliefs.   Like Anastasios Tsonis, says the current 'pause' in land surface temps is similar to one in the 70s, therefore we are entering a 50 year cooling phase.. despite that didnt happen in the 70s.  There is judith curry another famous denier, who simply says long term trends in ocean temps suggest we are heading to an ice age, without really expanding on that.  she also likes to promote the increase in area of sea ice, while totally ignoring the decrease in volume.    now in the 70s when we had the famous newsweek article, actually most scientists at the time still believed in warming despite the media talking to the minority that didnt. But at  this time, most of the minority that didnt, werent denialist. See not only are we putting chems that cause warming, we are also putting up chems that cause cooling. And we werent as sure as now, at how all the pluses and minuses added up. But we still use the science of some of these people, because they gave us great data and research on the chems we are putting up that cool, like soot and SO2
The GOP obviously.  A. only a moron would think the dems intended for federal exchanges to not get subsidies.  B. the supreme court wouldnt hear the case, had the GOP not brought it up. Its not proactive.  c. it would take one line to fix it and the gop wont.. they will insist on repealing the individual mandate. Which is basically repealing Obamacare.  Only a complete dumbass wouldnt blame the GOP on this clusterfuck. Had the GOP not acted, everyone would still get their subsidies. No matter what as the supreme court isnt proactive.  cause - effect  pretty fucking simple.. but i suspect you right wingers will cry  "show us one republican that voted for this mess"  lol  doesnt matter  yall sued to kill subsidies  yall are at fault   yall can blame the dems for aspects of the law people dont like.  the young dont like being forced on insurance. Small businesses hate the 1099 crap.  but if you think you will be able to blame the dems on yall killing the subsidies.. well I got a government closure and ted cruz for you to talk to. The dems didnt get blamed for that horse shit either.
i have ran 5 on lightning mode for ages. one of them i generally answer a few questions a night. the rest passive.   I will say this, this subreddit and well all of /r/beermoney  has a long history of inventing reasons people got banned. I dont doubt there have been mistake and unfair bans and perhaps this is the cause of some of the crockery but there has definately been some crockery. heck they used to say you would get banned if you only watched funny commercials or only teh app trailers.  I seriously dont think they will ban people for using their apps, any way you can use their apps, without using other programs, and going beyond device limits. Meaning click what ever button, watch what ever video.. as long as you arent cheating through automation, or more devices, it would not only be retarded for them to care, it would be hard to design an accurate system, of banning people relaly cheating versus kids losing their phones behind theri beds while playing perk pop quiz and crap.  they arent going to ban you for using theri apps,   5 phones per app, give them your id, no automation, no commercial skipping, upgrade when upgrades come(not an iron rule but a good one to follow) and you should be good.
