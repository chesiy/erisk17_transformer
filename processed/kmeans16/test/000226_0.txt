This is a fascinating depiction of both the resilience of nature in the face of adversity and the significant long-term, unintended, and unexpected consequences of the oil spill.  The uncertainty of the science coming from the oil spill makes it more difficult to accurately portray the magnitude of the impact.  First-hand accounts like these, which cite experts who live and work among the impacted ecosystems, are a valuable resource.
The influence of infrastructure on human behavior is incredible.  Moreover, it's an important consideration in evaluating the long-term costs of any major infrastructure project.  While protected bike facilities may or may not be profitable at current usage rates, the resulting behavior change could decrease long-term costs by reducing wear and tear on roads and improving general health (through improved air quality and fitness and reduced accident fatalities).
These pesticides provided what was deemed a necessary service at the time of their invention.  Recent research on the potential health effects of pesticides like Roundup and 2,4-D is a good reminder that every product has costs and benefits--and that producers should be as aware as possible of both before marketing the good.    This is a particularly salient reminder as the world seeks alternative energy sources to replace fossil fuels.  These technologies will have costs and benefits as well, and to make sure they are truly sustainable, their full life cycle must be considered.
It is amazing to see the breadth of impacts that climate change could have on the world.  Many of the worst harms will have implications for human health as ecosystems collapse, the incidence and severity of extreme weather events increases, and climatic patterns shift.  This panel follows the publication of the Pope's encyclical on the environment, another landmark report by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate change, and numerous recommendations and warnings from the US Environmental Protection Agency, all in the last year.  Momentum is building.
Many ecologists use birds as an indicator species for overall ecosystem health.  If our birds are in trouble, ecosystems likely are as well, and ecosystem approaches (like the wetland restoration programs the article mentions) may lead to more success stories down the road.
Agreed -- very cool phenomenon. Here's a link to the video: http://e360.yale.edu/slideshow/blizzard_helps_scientists_visualize_airflow_around_wind_turbines/328/1/
Yes -- here's what a 2011 Nature study (linked in article) says: "Contrail cirrus are composed of ice crystals thatsimilarly to natural cirrusreflect solar short-wave radiation and trap outgoing long-wave radiation." Because they're so long-lived, the trapping effect outweighs the reflection effect.
