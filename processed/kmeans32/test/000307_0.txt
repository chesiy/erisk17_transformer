Multiverse
The "leave me alone" thing most people have mentioned works most of the time, provided the spirit is not interested in you personally.  It depends on the purpose/nature of the spirit.    Take for example, the situation with my ex.  Shortly after we met, I found out about his ex who had died in a car crash.  This came up after I told him about the lovely dream I had in which at one point a woman I didn't know glared at me and stared me down.  I described her to him, and then he told me about her and that he was worried that would happen, as she had harassed the two girlfriends he'd had since her passing.  I later came to find out that she had been actively haunting him as well.    I'm not going to go into my history or anything beyond the scope of this story, but when I told him I was going to get rid of her, he said his exes had tried and it didn't work.  I don't know what they tried, and there's no need to go over the altercation in detail, because there wasn't much of a confrontation or laughing at her or telling off like you alluded to in your question.  It was more like we both know what we're here for and I'm here to kick your *** out.  On both sides.  The next day when I saw him, he was shocked BC he hadn't seen or heard from her, and apparently didn't think I could get rid of her.    It was then that I realized I had fallen in love with him, because I knew that I wouldn't have had the strength to win that fight otherwise.    That being said, that was a personal matter.  To address your question in a more generic and appropriate way, you cannot just confront a sport, you have to be prepared both in terms of knowing exactly what you're dealing with and in terms of strength and resistance to the challenges and risks the spirit may bring your way.  So, with regards to personal strength, you must first have control of your own thoughts, both so that you can channel your strengths and so that you can tell when someone's trying to mess with your mind.  The basic starting exercise for this is to clear your mind and think of nothing.  The challenge here is control over the urge to fill the silence with "I'm thinking of nothing!" Or thoughts about your breathing.  Once you manage to work past that to where you can clear your mind for a good minute, establishing control over your thoughts (if you're squeamish or weak stomached, this will help you a lot to that end),  You must also, once you have mastered the first, learn how to protect yourself.  If you want to pursue that once you've become master of your own mind, feel free to pm me, or you could post in /r/energywork and ask perhaps about a basic aura shield, although no two people may tell you the same thing.     To recap, to confront a spirit or entity of any kind, you must know exactly what you are up against, as much as possible, have control of your own mind so you can be sharp and know when someone is messing with you, and know most importantly how to defend and protect yourself (to which clearing your mind is a precursor).    Only then, can you prepare the appropriate offensive strategy for the specific encounter.

it's not your fuck up, it's your mom's.  It's a good thing that everyone found out, really.  They say ignorance is bliss, and it could have been, but for one, your lives would be a lie, two, your dad needed to know the truth, three, even though she did a really bad thing, your mom is also no longer under the pain and strain of keeping that secret.    In the long run, you did everyone a favor.   The fact that she broke down like that over a simple genetics conversation means that she was having trouble holding it together in the first place.  Also, better now while you're all still fairly young instead of finding out later in life and possibly destroying the entire family irreperably (as there'd be no obligation to stick together, and also more years of lies).  edit: oh, and also your sister deserves to know her true identity.  Your father raised her and is still her dad to her and hopefully always will be on his end.  But it's a good thing for her to find out who her biological father is if she wants to; at least she has the opportunity.
that was beautiful 3
definitely don't actually physicall hear it in my ear, but I play instruments and stuff, so I am familiar with music, so when I listen to music, I don't just listen to it as a whole; I listen to the individual parts and how they fit together.  As a result, when I have a song in my head, I hear it all in my head, complete with each instrument/element coming in when it should and what not.  The purpose of the background info was to demonstrate my explanation for this, which is about encoding.  I think I encode more details of the music by having listened for an appreciated them in the first place, and that results in my being able to play music back in my head as vividly as if I had earbuds in.  So /u/Jelith , it is possible to have the music be "quite as good as the real thing" while it's in your head.
I wrote this and recorded it today.  I normally do pop rock / alternative, so this is somewhat softer than my usual style, so I am looking for constructive criticism please I would really appreciate it.    The song is called [Therapy] (https://soundcloud.com/test_subject8889/therapy)  (for reference I use a USB studio condenser mic if that means anything to you.)  Thank you in advance!

thanks so much; I'm glad you did!  I was actually most concerned about the ending, afraid I may have ruined it with my impulsive twist.  Glad that was not the case :)  edit (clarification): I mean only the last detail of the reveal was on impulse

People laughing in your face man.  The one time I ever got suspended, I was in 10th grade (year 11 for any Brits reading), I was scared and devastated, kind of internally losing my shit.  The particular assistant principle who was asking me questions and filling out the paperwork was a real jerk to me.  I'm not saying I deserved to be treated specially or anything like that, but I believe I deserved a basic level of human respect, you know?  In my fear and anxiety I asked a kind of silly question, which he could have just answered matter-of-factly or maybe, maybe chuckled at, but instead he more than guffawed; he outright laughed out loud to my face when he answered me.   This of course only served to make my fear and anxiety (about what awaited me at home) much worse.  I was in trouble though, so that's one thing.  Last semester, I am in Grad school btw, during a meeting about our theses (dissertation in other nations), just to go over general guidelines, I asked a serious question about the scope of the topic area (trans-atlantic comparative policy as opposed to a purely European focus), and the professor leading the meeting did the same obnoxious laugh in my face and rather than saying "yes, people have done that; it fits the program name well." he said " *guffawing laughter* well it has to have some European element to it; otherwise, why are you in [this] program?"  Thanks; thanks a lot.  Made me want to leave the room at the time, but it was a mandatory meeting. He made it clear that he didn't think I belonged there when it came to my assignments too, but it's ok.  I'm not the one with a problem, so I don't let these things get to me.
I love that episode.
smart teachers make you swap papers twice.  two graders.
wow; well kudos for picking it back up!  I never fully dropped it, but I have been somewhat inactive the past 5 years as well.  (Which was mainly to protect someone and because of a relationship I was putting all my energy into.  But that's irrelevant.)  I too have the dreams, quite frequently when I get enough sleep.  Getting adequate sleep will help you have more of the dreams.   You can remember dreams better if you make a note of it right away.  Keep a notepad and pen on your nightstand.  and thanks for the welcome :)
i've come to the same taking chances conclusion.  I was only single for three days in high school; I started HS in an LTR and finished it an in LTR which just ended last year.  I am now in grad school with a deplorably limited amount of expierience in this confusing "game" if you will.    Depending on how you look at it, you could say the taking chances has worked out ok so far, but I've learned that you should still be careful when taking chances, so as not to ruin anything along the way.  So, I'm still holding the taking chances philosophy, but I'm being cautious.  Perhaps too cautious, but I honestly don't know what to do in any situation I am faced with in this regard, as I have practically 0 experience in being single.
yes, people do; I personally don't have the patience for it.  I'm sure it gets faster and more effective with practice, but starting out it takes an insanely long period of intense concentration and I'm just not up to the task.    A friend of mine did it in class when he was little and freaked people out.    now, something marginally easier which I have accomplished is using energy to manipulate electronic devices.  It has a visible physical result, but the energy doesnt have to be converted into physical kinetic energy; it remains as an electrical impulse just as it started in your mind, which is my understanding of why this is easier to do.    My most successful experience occurred, in 8th grade, out of necessity, which is key actually; unless you are really practiced in these things, for it to work, you have to **need** it.  There is great power and energy in desperation.  With which I incapacitated 7 overhead projectors in various ways (as I did not specify a method in my intention).  The great necessity felt by my 13 year old mind?  I had trouble reading from those antiquated projectors and I did not want to be made to get glasses.  My desire to not have to get glasses was a really intense need to me.    The point of adding that last detail is that, **need** is relative.  It's the energy created from the need that fuels this.    Being full of energy as you are, you probably don't *need* the **need**.
as far as the second 2 are concerned, read this and maybe get your eyes checked https://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/31bkpi/meta_psa_see_something_out_of_the_corner_of_your/  Although I have had things disappear and come back, as have we all.   The beiber thing is interesting.  In relation to the first one, someone else recently posted about having seen a movie before it came out so maybe talk to them? http://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/31cev8/i_saw_a_movie_before_it_even_came_out/
This is mind-blowing.  I used to pronounce it BerenstEEn, and there is no way I would say steen with an a in it.    This is incredibly disturbing.  But I have a theory.  I read about the shifting realities idea, and I think it is much simpler than that.   Reality did not shift; our perception of it did.  (the following theory comes from my experiences studying Criminal Justice and Psychology formally, and science informally, as well as my personal thoughts)  It is a well-known fact that everyone perceives and experiences things differently.  This is why 10 people could witness an event and have experienced it and remembered it in 10 different ways.  This is due to one's perceptual set, or frame of reference.  We all perceive and understand the world differently, in our own unique ways, based upon our experiences and understanding.  (for a clear and simple example, someone from the developing world would experience DisneyWorld fireworks differently than a Los Angeles native).   Although each individual's experiences shape his or her perceptual set, large portions of it are shaped by culture.  So, let's consider our western young-adult demographic as a culture for this situation.    Something caused a sharp shift in our culture's collective frame of reference.  We now perceive the world differently than we did as children (not necessarily just from becoming adults, although that is possible), and thus the shift from Stein to Stain is not a shift in reality, but rather a shift in our perception of reality.  We can find no record of Stein because no matter what we look at, we will perceive it as Stain.  The cause of the shift could be adulthood, 9/11, or anything else which has greatly altered all of our perceptual sets.  Thoughts?
the same way that we all have the ability to sense when something is wrong with a friend or family member, or when you get that feeling that something is not right....you could call it picking up on the vibes, or feeling/reading auras from people, but we all do it; just some people have honed it as a skill and can do it better, or are more aware of doing it.  He must have really really needed to pass gas, and you were just receptive enough at the moment to sense that vibe and urgency radiating from him.  It's a perfectly simple and logical explanation.    Still a funny story though.
well, like I said, really powerful.  I'm assuming the numbers were drawn out of a hat or jar or something, manually?  that may just be really good luck (or a wiccan or Magick spell for luck, as some others said she may have been in that branch/brand of, um, energy manipulation if you will). If the drawing was done electronically, then that has a much simpler explanation, as thoughts are electrical impulses.  It is not too difficult to manipulate electronics.
Predictive Poetry   I have many stories about predictive dreams, but everyone has those and they are abundant.  I have, however, a weird story involving poetry that I wrote.  I have written a lot of serious poetry, but at that particular point in my life, I was in a humor poetry phase, particularly humor at others' expense.  (I know, I was immature in school; so was everyone else).   Our English teacher had been on leave long-term because she had had a baby.  We had a long-term sub who was actually a retired teacher, from the "old school" if you will.  She made us diagram sentences and other tedious, outdated, unnecessary, nit-picky grammatical things.   She also assigned far more homework than we were accustomed to.  We all abhorred that class under her (a word I learned independently that year).  After a few weeks of this, even our parents had complained to the school about the amount of work Mrs.Substy* would assign.  We had no idea when our normal teacher would be coming back.  One day, in homeroom, in the morning, I wrote a poem about her going away.  It was wishful thinking at its' finest.  It started with:  "today's the day, today's the day, the day Mrs. Substy* goes away!..." and ended with a simple "...good riddance!". (I still have the hard, hand-written copy of the poem back at home).  I showed it to my friends and we had a good laugh.  That afternoon, when we went to English class, SURPRISE!  Our regular teacher was back!  Mrs. Substy* really was gone!  At the time, I wondered if this meant I could make things happen by writing poetry, but I realize now, of course, that it meant I subconsciously picked up on the vibe somehow and predicted it.   TL;DR: I wrote a poem about a strict long-term substitute teacher going away that day, and then she actually did.
I am not a skeptic, but it's clear to me that this is muckracking (gathering sparse examples into a weak case).  the chairs flipping can be wind, stray dogs, anything really.  The fridge opening by itself happens, as does with cabinets.  Pressure from the contents, the temperature, etc (especially if its an older fridge they don't close well).  Lights also act wierdly on their own, both incadesents and CFLs.  Noises like something fell but finding nothing happen in my house all the time.  I joke that there's a ghost, but I mean, it happens.  The tapping on your headboard is the creepiest, but I'm inclined to think nothing of it because the picture looks faked.  I mean, they say real blood looks fake to us because our mental concept of what blood looks like is based on fake tv blood.  So if its a real pic then, I'm sorry.   Giving you the benefit of the doubt, if it is real, sit calmly on your bed, relax and settle in as if to meditate, reach your mind out around the house, try to get a feel for the presense.  If you can sense it, try to contact it.  Just sense for it and think really hard/ loudly "I mean you no harm; I want to help you; what do you need?"  Try to find out what the issue is.  hope this helps.  edit: typos
yes, exactly.  In my case, it was personal, so it was most appropriate to personally show her the door.  In op's case, if it does turn out to be something like a racist great grandparent or something, it may come down to her bf talking the spirit down.  It will depend on the details of the situation.

I grew up in the south, but my whole family is from NY (deets here http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2yft7m/what_accent_do_you_have/cpc5zf7)  So, in the south they say I have a neutral accent, but in the north they say its southern.  But I do not say y'all.  I have always said "you guys"

"This is a delicious burger; thanks" "No problem" "and thanks for disposing of that dead raccoon for me; It was stinking up my driveway. I know you were tried from your shift at the restaurant." "speaking of which"
"If I never see your face again, I don't mind, cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight."
love the flair
there's no telling if it was him or now; we can't verify who this guy really is, and who really cares?  It would matter if he was taking credit for something of at least a small importance, but this means nothing.
