Nearly 1,000 bridges in Arizona are labeled as problematic by the Federal Highway Administration.   There are 8,035 highway bridges in Arizona in the 2014 National Bridge Inventory Database, compiled the FHA. Of those, 256 are considered structurally deficient and 684 are functionally obsolete.
I take it you are most likely voting against any Republican candidate, that thus they are "the enemy"  I have always thought it important to know the enemy well.  I guarantee you there are several Republican candidates that are very smart, very articulate, and persuasive (if not to you).   Depending who is nominated, this is not likely to be a cakewalk for the Democrat nominee.
Well - - that's only 14 times - - so far ...
This 20s movie as you put it was made in 1948 and starred Humphrey Bogart.  It has an IMDB rating of 8.3, and a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 100%/critics   93%/audience.   It is #34 on Rotten Tomatoes list of the [Top 100 movies of all time]( http://www.rottentomatoes.com/top/bestofrt/)  So yes, a paraphrased quote was used in a 40+ year old movie (Blazing Saddles). It was also used many, many other times.

"Wildlife experts believe it has since left the city, headed down the Peninsula, but not before taking a stroll through town first."  I have no clue why they think this, or how it would make its way that far through the city, but I hope they are correct.   I used to live on the "Peninsula" and have seen mountain lions twice in the hills.  They are majestic, and a bit frightening at the same time.
"**Evergreen**"? Really? That's what you learned from this page? How about:  "The origin of the lemon is unknown"  "The tree's ellipsoidal yellow fruit" ... it has ellipsoidal fruit!  "used for culinary and non-culinary purposes ... cleaning uses."  "In 1747, James Lind's experiments on seamen suffering from scurvy involved adding lemon juice to their diets, though vitamin C was not yet known."  and "lemonade"
I hope you take this in the spirit it is meant. While my ex was the one that was very disrespectful within our relationship (see my other post in this thread) I had difficulties with her beliefs as well.  To sum it up, the majority of Christians have a belief in an afterlife that is conditional on your behavior (yes, I've really oversimplified, but please go with me on this).   It can be very difficult to see the person you love most as being on a path that does not lead to the afterlife that you believe in. So, while a Christian may initially say they are OK with you being an atheist, be aware - - belief is a powerful force, and as time goes on, it can really mess with how one sees their partner.
Not a direct answer, but here's some more Reddit related info from [The Seattle Times](http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/reddit-moderators-shut-down-parts-of-site-over-employees-dismissal/)  Reddit sells large, targeted advertising campaigns that run at the top of individual subreddits.  The events come at a particularly inauspicious time for Reddit, which only a week ago celebrated its 10th anniversary. Last year, Reddit raised $50 million in venture capital and planned to use the money for hiring and refining the advertising business.  The site has been valued at roughly $250 million, according to a recent disclosure by its lawyers. Advance Publications, the parent company of Cond Nast, still owns a majority of the company and retains a board seat.  The company has had its problems during the past year. Yishan Wong abruptly resigned in November as Reddits chief executive after a dispute with the companys board of directors.  Reddit has also taken steps to combat harassment on and off its site, moves that many members of the community complain have stifled the principles of free speech upon which the site was founded.  There has also been tension between factions of the Reddit community and Ellen Pao, the companys interim chief executive, whom many Reddit users blame for imposing the anti-harassment policies. An online petition asking Pao to step down has garnered more than 13,000 signatures.  Reddit users have also questioned Paos ability to lead the company while dealing with major issues in her personal life. For nearly two years, Pao was embroiled in a well-publicized discrimination lawsuit against Kleiner Perkins Caufield   Byers, the venture-capital firm. Pao lost that case in March.
Yes. I looked it up myself, and the length of time between sunsets does vary significantly throughout the year. This is *so* not intuitive to me.   But the times I get are different than yours (I might be doing the math wrong). I get 2 hours 23 min today, and 2 hours 56 min. at Christmas.   I think this is correct since the Earth is about 24,000 miles around, so you'd need to travel about 1000 mph (at equator) to keep up with the sun. Less at relevant latitudes.   Did I do this right/wrong?
I'm not trying to. She's gone - no coming back. I'm just making a small statement. It's up to "whomever" to decide how to react to my statement - - if at all. Thank you for at least reacting.
I believe that Victoria facilitated an AMA on oppression. Perhaps she could help shed some light on this situation.

When I have a great interaction as a customer, I make sure I get their name, and then . . .   - As I walk to my car I use Maps.Google.com to get the store/restaurant phone #  - I immediately call on speaker phone so I can do it NOW while I'm driving and it costs me no time  - I ask to speak to the Mgr, and say "Hey, you need to know what just happened with one of your employees . . ."  - As they brace for yet another complaint, I hit them with how fantastic Jane was (and why), and it's people like this that make me a loyal customer.  I guarantee: you, the manager, and the employee will all have a better day because you took the time.   Edit: I thought about it, and I agree that an email, if you really will take the time, is even better since it creates a permanent record. I will now do both.
Thank you for the correction and additional info.   I heard about this on a radio program and it was absolutely frightening.   To be dismissed as dead, as you hear everything around you, with no way to break through, and to live that way for years, that would be crazy making.

Wow - solid post. I was just going to post: "**I would smile**".
I guess I'll just let go, 'cause  . . .  Why did I have to act so mean?  Don't I know I'm human being?  Born of a mother with the love of a father  Reflections come and reflections go  I know sometimes I wanna let go  I know sometimes I want to let go

Legal experts said they're often surprised that people who comment online, even younger Internet users who've grown up online, seem to believe they're protected.  "In my experience with speaking with groups, and even speaking with some students, they seem to believe they will be protected when they speak on the Internet because they choose to use some fictitious name," Tulane University law professor Amy Gajda said.  Illinois' opinion was based in large part on a pair of earlier, lower-court decisions in the state, which held that the anonymity of someone who makes comments in response to online news stories isn't guaranteed if their opinions are potentially defamatory, according to Don Craven, an attorney for the Illinois Press Association.  "It's not that you get to say whatever the heck you want to say and you're going remain anonymous," Craven said.
Use a large pot/bucket.  Put in 1" to 2" of water.  Dump in a tray or 2 of ice.  Insert feet.  Do this along with the other suggestions and you will definitely cool down.

Unfortunately most authors of such books are writing from the perspective that the USA only ever acts honestly, fairly and with appropriate consideration for everyone  As TIME editor-at-large and president of Eurasia group Ian Bremmer is more nuanced than "most".  [Here's an interview that give's a sense of Bremmer's approach](http://time.com/3843599/ian-bremmer-united-states-superpower-china/)
I found this, not sure if it's true ...  "A Hammerhead Shark was the first shark known to demonstrate asexual reproduction (where a female produced young without the input of a male). In addition, they are one of the few animals, along with pigs and human beings, that can suntan as their skin becomes darker with increased exposure to harmful rays when swimming close to the waters surface."

They don't have to fly very high to be out of rock throwing range.  And with cameras on board people firing weapons (including slingshots) will be subject to criminal charges - especially if the images are live transmissions.   At $10k - $15k a piece they sound pretty effective.
TIL Rope (1948 Jimmy Stewart, IMDb 8.1 RT 97%) is an 80 min Hitchcock film shot in only 10 takes, with every other cut masked so it looks like only 5 takes (projectionists changed reels every 20 min) It takes place in real time, is Hitchcocks first Technicolor film, and was banned for homosexuality
There are 10 of these disturbing fairy tales in the article.  **Sleeping Beauty** - In one of the very earliest versions of this classic story, published in 1634 by Giambattista Basile as Sun, Moon, and Talia, the princess does not prick her finger on a spindle, but rather gets a sliver of flax stuck under her fingernail. She falls down, apparently dead, but her father cannot face the idea of losing her, so he lays her body on a bed in one of his estates. Later, a king out hunting in the woods finds her, and since he cant wake her up, rapes her while shes unconscious, then heads home to his own country. Some time after that, still unconscious, she gives birth to two children, and one of them accidentally sucks the splinter out of her finger, so she wakes up. The king who raped her is already married, but he burns his wife alive so he and Talia can be together. Dont worry, the wife tries to kill and eat the babies first, so its all morally sound.
When post-Cold War Ukraine gained independence, it held the worlds third-largest stockpile of nuclear weapons. Rather than use nukes for protection, Ukraine sought and received assurances from the international community that its borders would be respected if it gave up its nuclear weapons. In 1994, the U.S., United Kingdom and Russia signed the Budapest Memorandum, in which **all sides pledged to respect Ukraines territorial integrity, refrain from using military force or economic pressure to limit Ukrainian sovereignty and provide assistance to Ukraine if it became the victim of aggression from another nation.**   Obviously, Russia has broken its part of that agreement. Now the question is whether the US will break theirs.   **If the U.S. breaks their word, they should consider the devastating impact on American counter proliferation efforts around the world**. How could any nation ever trust U.S. security assurances if they see, in the carnage and destruction in Ukraine, **the deadly folly of trading nuclear weapons for American guarantees**?
