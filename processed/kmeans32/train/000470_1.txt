Every other time I went to a hospital the nurses were nice and helpful but in the psych ward they were hostile.  Well, that's understandable at the very least though, right? They might deal with people who are literally insane on a semi-regular basis.  And if you didn't eat their food, what did you eat?
I feel like Kevin Owens and John Cena are husband and wife who can't agree on how to raise their kid   John Cena is the mother who constantly showers the child with positivity, tells them that they can be whatever they want when they grow up, and lets them believe in fairy tales for as long as they want.  Kevin Owens, meanwhile, is the asshole father with the "grim realist" attitude who doesn't want his kid to walk around thinking the whole world is sunshine and gumdrops. Life sucks and then you die. Period.  And, like a good asshole father, he doesn't even spend a lot of time trying to properly explain these things to the child. He just mocks the mother in an attempt to make her feel bad about herself and give in to his viewpoints.
I think that makes sense.  Unless it's Shawn Michaels _
Ah, I see. Yeah, that might have been a good idea. Honestly, I was just venting (even though I still feel that what happened wasn't cool), but I can definitely learn from this.
I don't even understand what he/she is trying to say. All I can imagine is someone sitting on the couch in front of their TV, with an antenna not hooked up to anything, moving it around to try to pick up a signal like people do with their cell phones.
I mean, I may be wrong, but [somehow, I doubt it](http://www.incrediblehulkonline.com/mediumsecretwarsstrength.jpg)
Thank YOU for making this post. Everything you mentioned was insightful and made a lot of sense, and I hope lots of people see it.
I find it sort of funny that The Authority taunted Bryan for being a "B+ player," but Seth Rollins is their "Plan B."   Being someone's Plan B isn't something to be proud of. You're just something they settled for because their original goals didn't transpire and they needed something to turn to in a time of desperation.  You're not what they really wanted-- you're more like "Whatever. I guess that's good enough." Like going to the store to get two-ply toilet paper, but they only have one-ply.
Firefox-only problem: Can't see certain streaming video unless I open in new tab or window   I'm trying to watch videos on NBA.com, and the way certain videos work is that you click a link, and a little mini-window will pop up where you can watch the video(s) you selected. If you click [this link](http://on.nba.com/1AaNcJZ), I believe it should show you exactly what I just described.  When I do that, and the video tries to load, it never does, and I just get a blank screen (but I can hear the audio). But if I right-click on one of the thumbnails of the videos on the right side of the mini-window, and select "Open in new tab/window," I can see the video just fine.  It's a minor inconvenience, but does anyone know what the issue might be? I've tested this in the other internet browsers I have, too, and it's only Firefox that has this problem.
Oh, I should have mentioned, I am taking medication to try and stymie my depression/anxiety. And the sad part is, right now, based on what I described in the OP, I'd say I'm better than I was before the meds.  But now it feels like they can't help me anymore and I'm still, as you said, "depressed as all hell," and I don't know how to fix it.  I've tried a psychologist, and he would give me things to do that he thought would help me overcome my depression, but it didn't work. The few times I was able to find the motivation to actually do the "homework" he'd assign, it just made me feel worse because it took me out of my comfort zone, and that scares the hell out of me.
Jumper/Nightcrawler effect request? Willing to pay.   Would someone be willing to create a short Jumper/Nightcrawler video clip for a project I'm doing? [Something like this](http://i.cdn.turner.com/nba/nba/.element/media/2.0/teamsites/spurs/imgs/E775Qom.gif). Nothing long at all.  As said in the title, I'll gladly pay for the clip since I know how complex an effect this can be.  Anyone who's interested can post here or PM me.  Thanks, guys.
Much thanks.
Wrestling itself is getting way more meta than it's ever been, with great heels who actually have good characters (Heyman is obviously one-- Bray Wyatt is another) and aren't "I don't like you, me you fight" cookie-cutters.  A lot of times, those heels tend to be devilish/demonic in nature. The Sith Lord comparison was a good one for Heyman, whereas Wyatt molds himself more along the lines of Darth Vader, obviously.
Job literally didn't even last two days because of a misunderstanding, supervisor refuses to listen to me (or maybe I'm mistaken about something)   On my first day working stock at a retail store, I worked from 6AM-12 noon for $7.75 an hour. I am absolutely, 100% positive of all of that.  At noon, me and my two co-workers were given the usual break after the first part of our shift (loading the merchandise from the truck into the store).  First, let me say this about my supervisor-- she seemed to have an attitude with me from the start. She would hang up on me rudely while we were on the phone ("I'm in the middle of working, goodbye" without giving me a chance to even respond) and actually decided to keep talking to a co-worker about what was pretty much nothing but bullshit when I first inquired about the job. I actually had to wait until they stopped gossiping about other people before I could talk to her.  Anyway, at about 12:30 on that first day, I asked her how long she needed me for the day. That's all I said. I said "How long do you need me here today?" I will admit I looked tired, because I was, but she (to this day) believes that I asked to go home early, which I didn't.  Even when she said "You can go home, Raymond," I hesitated and started to say something along the lines "No, I didn't want to--" and she interrupted me with "You can go home, Raymond" again. Fine, I can take a hint. You don't want me here today-- yeah, I was working a little slowly and didn't know what I was doing a lot. Maybe that's because I received no training, not even a pamphlet on how to identify where to place which items (the aisles were conveniently NOT labeled at all). But whatever. I left.  At that point, right before I left, she said she will call me when she needs me. I said okay, thank you. Also, later that day, I sent a text to one of my co-workers, and he said the Monday morning shift is from 6AM to 2PM. That's all I wanted to know from her, but moving on...  After she didn't call for a week to give me hours, I called her and asked what was going on and also why I didn't get my direct-deposit paycheck. She claimed that:  1. I only worked half a day on Monday, which is 3 1/2 hours, so I only earned roughly $23, and 2. That I was a no-call no-show for the rest of that week.  How in the world can it be a no-call no-show if I wasn't even assigned to work? That doesn't make any sense. She said "**I will call YOU when we need you.**" Then she blamed ME for not calling HER and is trying to claim that as a no-call no-show? I don't understand.  And I know damn well I worked more than 3 1/2 hours. I got there before she did (at about 5:45 AM-- was told to be there by 6), started work as soon as possible (somewhere between 6:15-6:25, since SHE was late), and I know if I ask any of my co-workers, they'll say we definitely didn't finish the first part of our shift until about noon, which is right before I "asked to go home."  I didn't get a chance to clock in and out, which would solve all this nonsense (at least the monetary part), because she didn't have my employee numbers ready.  When I asked her about the status of my job after he "No-call no-show" comment, she replied "What job?" Again, I can take a hint. I didn't even bother pushing any further. I told her I'd go pick up my measly fucking $23 tomorrow (in so many words) and I even had the courtesy to say "Thank you" (which actually still baffles me).  Why am I being blamed for everything? And why did I lose my job because she didn't call me back and then told HR that I was a no-call no-show, AND told them I worked half a day, when I worked til noon on a day I was supposed to stay until 2? That's NOT half a day. Anybody can do that math. Places I've worked in the past, your hours don't get rounded down based on when you come in and when you leave. You get paid based on the hours during which you work.  And why does she keep saying I asked to go home? What kind of BS is that? I did no such thing. The fact that she INTERPRETED it that way isn't my fault. I never said anything along the lines of "Can I leave now?" or "Is it okay if I go home early today?" I said "How long do you need me here?"  If I'm wrong, please let me know, and explain why. I'm dying to know.
[Oh... well if it's that easy, then say no more.](http://i.imgur.com/ZLcHNW7.png)  I'm guessing I ain't got it.
I fell asleep after I made this thread. I might make a new one so I can reply more quickly, and hopefully get more responses. I love answering questions about this.
I have somnophilia, which means I'm extremely attracted to sleeping/unconscious/sedated women. I literally cannot reach orgasm with a woman if she's awake. AMA.   For the record, this is not to be confused with either necrophilia or any kind of rape fetish. It's not based on the potential lack of consent (in fact, prior consent makes it better), and the woman *does* have to be breathing.  So go ahead and ask me anything. Anything at all. Nothing's off limits.
Well, I don't plan to play any humans. I can probably live with just having fun playing the AI-- I don't see myself becoming a hardcore fighting gamer.  Also, with the combo memorization, I'm afraid that if I go through the entire process with one combo, and master it, I'll lose that mastery once I move on to the next combo (especially since a lot of recent games are so open-ended and have many unique combo possibilities).
The reason I included mostly his WWE career is that I'm much more familiar with it than his WCW career.  I do know certain things that I think I left out, like how he would lash out at referees for trying to raise his arm after a win (despite being a babyface-- that's typically a heel move), or the fact that after his first match (I think), Gene Okerlund attempted to interview him, and Goldberg just walked away without saying anything.  Plus the fact that he quite literally won 173 straight matches, including a World Championship victory over one of the most accomplished wrestlers of all time, and I don't recall hearing him brag about it ever (in kayfabe-- though, to be fair, he was never much of a talker).
[REQUEST] Male or female voice-over for dramatic sports highlight video   This would be for a basketball project, so preferably someone with a non-regional, American accent, but I'll consider alternatives as well.  The voice-over itself should convey drama and a sort of quiet intensity. Something like a movie trailer (especially relevant since it's a basketball/film crossover project). If this sounds too specific, don't worry-- I'm definitely not picky.  Here's a sample line from the (349-word) script:  *While their fiery glares are incapable of slaying the enemy, these nearly omnipotent men show extraordinary abilities which eerily resemble another well-known faction of superhuman allies.*  *Whether seeing the unseen with extra-sensory perception, or fighting injuries that would disable mortal men, true warriors of the hardwood know not the difference between fantasy and reality.*  Hopefully that sample elaborates well on the tone I'm looking for-- if not, I'd be glad to explain further, and also to answer any questions anyone has.  Note: I'm not sure if this would be considered long, but the entire script itself takes up just over half a page in Microsoft Word (Verdana, 9-point font).  **EDIT:** Wow, thanks for all the submissions, guys! I'm pleasantly surprised that I was able to get so many on the same day. I'll go over all of them by tomorrow morning (probably around 9-10 AM EST), but that doesn't mean that more entries aren't welcomed. Please, by all means, if you see this thread and want to submit something, feel free.  **EDIT 2:** As I said before, I very much appreciate all the entries. You guys are amazing. I'll try to make my decision by tonight, and most likely tomorrow afternoon at the latest.  Thanks again, everybody!  **EDIT 3:** I made my decision and added the appropriate flair to the thread. I can't thank everyone enough for their contributions, and I look forward to working with members of this subreddit in the future.
I'll tell you know since I know how ruthless Reddit can be in the event of a noticeable meme mistake-- you didn't use this meme properly. There are only a few memes where one line of text is allowed, and this meme in particular is supposed to follow the "X... X everywhere" format.
What can a 24-year-old (with tons of free time) do to make extra money on the side while he looks for a job? Anything at all, as long as it's legal [x-post from r/AskReddit]   More details about my resources:  * I have my own place. A two-story house in which I live alone, owned by my father, to whom I pay rent using my savings.  * I'm an excellent typist and extremely computer/internet literate (I'd assume this isn't a rarity on Reddit).  * I'm not really good with stuff that's considered "handy" or anything regarding physical labor. I'm a lot better with my brain than my hands, but I'd definitely be willing to learn. The least I could do is try. Beggars, choosers, etc.  * I'm a very good creative writer, and I enjoy it. I've more or less mastered the English language from a syntax standpoint, and I have an enormous vocabulary with the ability to use it to an impressive extent.  Please don't take the last part as me bragging. I'm just trying to get across what I'm good at, in as much detail as possible. If you need to know anything else, I'd be glad to let you know.  Thanks.
You can argue Russell is the most dominate player over his peers if you want, but **no one can look at a game from the 60s and one from the 90s and say they are the same.**  And no one has said they are. The point is that Bill Russell did things no one else has done. Yes, his competition was weaker, but he accomplished a whole lot more than anyone else ever has.  That's like if I play NBA 2K14 on Rookie and score 1,000 points in one game with one player. You can use the "It's Rookie mode, too easy, only reason you did that" argument if you want, but 1,000 points with one player is amazing, period.
Haha, fair enough. That sounds pretty good for me, since I'm an offense-first guy (might have been obvious, given the team I use).  One more quick Q-- let's say I see a one-deep safety look, but the defense is actually running two deep safeties. One of the safeties might come down into the box (even though he's still going to play deep), but I should be able to exploit the fact that he's too close to the LoS with deep routes to his side, right?
For some reason, uTorrent (3.3.1 32-bit) cannot coexist with my internet connection   Using Windows 7 Ultimate, 64-bit with Comcast internet connected via wireless router.  Every time I run the program, my internet randomly drops for a few minutes at a time, although there are no actual indications. Nothing on the modem changes, my connection status stays the same, and the torrents even keep going. But anything that has to be reloaded (web pages, etc.) will not work (I'll get the same error message I'd get if I turned my internet off).  I couldn't figure out why until someone on this subreddit suggested it might be my torrent program, so I did some testing, and discovered that when the program isn't running, my internet has no problems at all. And when the program *is* running, I get the issues that I described earlier.  Is there anything you guys would recommend here so that I can run my torrent program without compromising my internet connection?  Thanks.
Nope. Never even got close to getting in trouble. tbqh, I suspect some women really like it. It's like, they're so attractive, that even when they're asleep, I can't resist my urge to have them.  It's actually a lot easier than you might think to ask a woman "Can I do stuff to you while you sleep?" At least once you get to know her and you're comfortable around each other. Usually, once we at least sleep together, she's sorta used to my nighttime tendencies, since I absolutely love to spoon, so of course I cop a feel every now and then during.
I need anything free that will help keep my laptop cool. I'm not trying to be cheap, I'm just broke as hell.   [General computer specifications](http://3image.com/images/2013/06/30/Spec.png)  [Graphics card specifications](http://3image.com/images/2013/07/23/gcard.png)  As you can see, the graphics card overheats (which I think is a consistent problem with this specific video card), which causes the motherboard and processors to over heat, and that causes my laptop to stall and struggle to run the simplest of tasks because of the excess heat. Plus I don't think that a constant temperature of ~75C is healthy for a laptop.  I'm looking for anything, *anything* at all that even has a chance of maybe helping with this problem. Software, BIOS updates, changes to any settings on the computer (such as under Control Panel, etc.). Anything. Anything at all.  Thanks in advance. If you need any more info, it shouldn't be a problem at all for me to provide it. Feel free to tell me if I've omitted anything important.
What human-like behavior(s) or traits have you seen/read about that one wouldn't expect from wild animals?   I made this thread a few days ago, starting off with "Zoologists/animal experts of Reddit," but now I realize that pretty much anyone could have a good answer for this thread.
My friend told me that I live like a prisoner   Since I spend 12 hours a day in a room with no light (I live by myself, in the basement of a two-story house), eat crappy food since I never have the energy or will to actually cook, never have friends over, and I go outdoors maybe once a week, only for 3-5 minutes at a time.     Plus the fact that every day is pretty much just me doing anything I can to keep from going insane and make it until tomorrow without losing my shit. He said that sounds like the life of someone serving time.    And I think he's right.    Depression is a prison.
I just realized that life is one big, sick, macabre joke (warning: morbid)   In life, you have two options-- die before the people you love, or watch the people you love die, knowing you can do nothing about it.  What a choice. I can't deal with this. I have no idea what the hell to do. I'm considering finding a way to live far away from everyone who knows me, and forging no new relationships with anyone there. I can't go through the grief of losing a loved one again-- I'm too sensitive emotionally. And I can't imagine my family seeing me on an autopsy table, unmoving... dead.  I can't fucking do it.
I am soooooooo high right now...   ... I think. I have no idea, since I've never been drunk or high on recreational drugs before.  I was recently prescribed an antidepressant called "vilazodone" by my doctor, and I started taking them two days ago (today was the third day I've taken it). Ever since I started using them, I've been feeling really, really weird (strange too, considering that I was told, and have heard, that these things take at least a month to work).  Anyway, since taking it for the first time, I feel the strangest combination of the following:  * Slight nausea * Lightheadedness/dizziness (sometimes feels like my head is "spinning") * Fatigue * Horniness  I have no idea if this is normal or not, or even if it's a placebo effect at work, but... it feels sooooooo goooooood... _  I'm not at all concerned or asking for a diagnosis. Just bored and thought maybe someone would find this funny/intriguing.
In my opinion, the greatest "Calvin and Hobbes" storyline of all time...   http://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1991/03/18  Things that stood out to me:  -At one point, Calvin (or at least the "real" Calvin combined with the "good" Calvin) smiles for 16 straight panels. I always look for stuff like that (I'm weird), and I can't remember another time he smiled for even four straight panels.  -Hobbes notes at the end of the story arc that Calvin is "The only person [he knows] whose good side is prone to badness." But, Watterson immediately asserts (through Calvin) that it might not have been simply a case of Calvin being so bad that not even the incarnate of his good side can't resist being evil.  Calvin claims that "He could only be perfectly good as an abstraction. In his human manifestation, he wanted to throttle me," implying that simply by being human, it was impossible for "Good Calvin" to be flawlessly benevolent. Watterson was clearly making a point about human nature and perhaps our inability to resist the allure of sin.  This is part of the reason I resent when people disregard Calvin and Hobbes as "just a newspaper comic." Both Watterson and his writing are extremely deep, and his ability to express fundamental truths about things like this, and the world overall, is the reason I've re-read all of the collections at least three times each.
