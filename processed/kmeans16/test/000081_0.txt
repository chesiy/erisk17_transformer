Haha!

Mac and cheese
True that, I was speaking specifically about women because that clown was saying it was ok. Hitting anyone is unnacceptable.
Hey, do me a favor, shut your face. There is no justifying coldcocking a woman in that manner. Peddle your bullshit elsewhere.
I have a Bernese Mountain dog and he is the most gentle dog on the planet. He thinks he is a lap dog, despite being 105 pounds. Also, he is so sweet and gentle with children and other dogs. He is simply the best!
It's not about wrong or right, it's all a matter of opinion. Interested to hear what dinosaur you think is the most badass.
Glad your friend was ok. A friend of mine got hit in the throat in a lacrosse game a few years back. He took a pretty hard shot (80-90 mph) right in the trachea and had to go to the hospital, but he also ended up being okay. Just some trouble breathing for a few days.
I'm not sure who to believe on this post. However, you posted a well thought out, seemingly informative and reasonable post that seems to be from a level of experience. Most posts in Reddit claim to be from someone in that field, when you can sometimes tell the person is just trying to make something up to sound smart or for karma. You are the only post in here on the other side of things, but you don't have that armchair professional air to your rhetoric. I can appreciate that. Have an upvote.
Does anybody else thinks she looks like Overly Attached Girlfriend?
I'm a 29 year old man and still have not mastered that skill yet...
Maybe a 5 or a 6, I just have seen every episode and picked up on it part of the way through reading your well-written post. Funny stuff.
Led Zeppelin's "Rock and Roll" was used in a Cadillac commercial and it's just not the same anymore.
That guy deserves to get his ass beat to within an inch of his life. I hope you are okay now and with someone who isn't a physcho.
What a dingleberry move on your part!
My cheeks get flushed and sweaty when I eat green apples. I never really noticed that this was unusual until I was wiping some perspiration off my cheeks and my girlfriend asked me why my face was so red. I told her about it and said that I thought this happened to everyone when they ate tart things. She laughed at me, called me weird and assured me that this was not normal. Am I dying? Is this a actual medical affliction?
