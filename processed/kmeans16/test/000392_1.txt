Okay.
Me? I'm okay I guess...
Thank you. I'm surprised by the comments I've received. I didn't really realise that there are other people who feel the same way as I do. Sometimes, I do try to make an effort to go out and do things, even if they're on my own, but more and more lately I find myself just opting to stay at home. I feel like I only make an effort because that's what I'm supposed to do. It's my responsibility to do my best to get better.   I wish you luck with your meds. Don't be afraid to talk to your doctor about trying different ones if those ones don't work for you. And give them time to work I guess. And you're right, they don't give you back the 'meaning' in your life, they only even out the emotions for you so you can find/create that meaning yourself. It's hard and it's frustrating but it's possible.
Definitely the live version of Latch by Sam Smith - he's an angel
Oh it's okay I found it! I just typed it in wrong the last time :3 Thank you!! :)
Oh my gosh I LOVED Kimi ni Todoke!!!
I've been recommended Golden Time a few times so I'm definitely going to watch it now! I really loved My Little Monster as well! Ano Natsu de Matteru looks good as well! Thank you for your suggestions! :)
I know! It was so good!
I mostly agree with what you're saying about the possibility of Squealer becoming a dictator himself had he managed to overthrow the humans. What's really scary about that though is coupled with the revelation that bakenezumi were genetically engineered from the non-PK humans, it really does seem plausible that Squealer would become just like the humans he was trying to overthrow. I definitely agree that Squealer wasn't good. I mean, even if someone argued that he was inciting war for the sake of liberating his species, the fact that it seemed he was planning to go further than that and straight to world domination stands. In the end, his opportunistic and calculating nature definitely make it seem like he was after more than just being free from humans.
Maybe try Glasslip? It isn't a straightforward anime though, like Akatsuki no Yona (which I also loved btw). I really enjoyed it though! Or maybe Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso? It was AMAZING
I agree with everyone here recommending Shinsekai Yori - IT'S AMAZING
I find this hard to accept - I've never failed a test in my life.
I had enough time to study on the train commute thank goodness! I'm probably the worst procrastinator I know. :/
Me too. Like right now.
Most amazing site for all logophiles!
I've nearly finished watching Shinsekai Yori and I'm just blown away by the impact it has. Like you, it's leaving me deep in thought and I can't help but feel really...dark. SSY isn't a happy anime by any stretch and I think it's meant to really challenge its audience. Ultimately, I think it makes us think a lot about human nature, and nature of ethics. It's hard not to find myself thinking about not only the characters and the plot, but the deeper themes of the anime as well. SSY is probably the best anime I've ever seen.
