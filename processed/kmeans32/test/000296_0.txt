Dank ass memes.
I need to understand something: is Umaru actually a shapeshifting demon creature? Or is it just stylistic? Because teenage girl T-1000 is fine by me.
I like that they did that, since it helps all the characters from different universes (and more importantly, art styles) to be in one game at the same time. It's not quite as good as Smash, but it works.
~~FUCK. HOW DO THESE THINGS ALWAYS SELL OUT BEFORE I HEAR ABOUT THEM. GOD FUCKING DAMNIT.~~  Edit: nvm I got one. We still good.
This is absolutely satire. It's even making fun of one of the worse (non-satire) minion memes, in which "a big black man raping you in the ass" is replaced by "if people are talking behind your back"
From the Inception episode.
There's Sadamoto's manga, which tells the same story, but with several minor (and some major) differences (For one, Kaworu shows up way earlier and is actually a full-fludged character). There's a couple other mangas as well, like Campus Apocalypse, but none of them are really very good like the original.   Once you've gotten to every Evangelion medium, you could try some other, similar shows. Gunbuster was the first work of Evangelion's director, Hideaki Anno. It's also a great work which greatly influenced mecha, especially Evangelion. They also share similar themes and characters, to the point where Shinji seems like Gunbuster's Noriko with a dick. There's also Gurren Lagann, which is an incredibly badass sort-of-parody of Evangelion. Finally, Madoka Magica. In the most basic sense, it's Evangelion with magical girls instead of mechs.
Why not?
The good news is that Ryu's amiibo will be one o might be able to get, since it looks like the third-parties are relatively common (at least at my local TRUS)
For publicity. The utter ridiculousness (and yet appropriateness) of a porn site sponsoring a player brings in traffic.
He'd tear them right back out again.   (Really though, [I don't think he'd be too broken up about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xew8SXUMxsE))
What is this, Shadow the Hedgehog?
From what I understand of your question, you *have* seen the series and want to buy it, correct? If not, all of these are in the order you should watch them (except Death and Rebirth, it's a glorified recap episode)  There's nowhere to legally digitally download any of the series to my knowledge, so I'll break down the releases by series:  NEON GENESIS EVANGELION:  There's been a couple releases on VHS, Laserdisc, and DVD. There's also an upcoming new DVD release and a Blu-Ray release which may or may not be coming to the West. The cheapest DVD box currently is ADV's "thin pack" Platinum Collection (you can find it on Amazon, but beware as there is a lot of bootlegging). This contains the whole series, plus the Director's Cut Episodes, in the highest available quality (until Blu Ray HD). It's the one I have. There's also another Platinum Collection, the "thick pack". Same contents, episodes 1-26/24'. But this one has many more bonus features, though the overall quality sufferers for it.   TL;DR: If you want cheap(ish) but good image quality, Thin Platinum. If you can spend more and don't mind slightly lower image quality of it means more content, then the Thick Platinum. If you want both and want to try your luck, you can wait for the New DVD or Blu-Ray.   DEATH AND REBIRTH  Don't even bother. It's getting included with End of Evangelion anyway.   END OF EVANGELION  This had a couple DVD releases from Manga Entertainment and another company who I don't remember. It's expensive as FUCK for a U.S. copy of the DVD ($100+, MIN). If you have a multi-region DVD player (or a PC), just import an English copy from the UK. For whatever reason it's really cheap across the pond. This is also getting re-released on Blu-Ray, though no confirmation of a new DVD has come up. This brings us back to D+R. The Blu-Ray of NGE includes "Revival of Evangelion", which is the final cut of Death (the recap half of Death and Rebirth) cut together with the final cut of End of Evangelion.   TL;DR: **GOD SAVE THE QUEEN**  Evangelion 1.11: You Are (Not) Alone  This one's been pretty easy to find, but there *is* some fuckery afoot. There also exists a release on DVD and Blu-Ray of Evangelion 1.01, which is just a non-remastered version of the same movie that came out, then they realized there was some work that needed to be done, hence 1.11. (1.0 is the theatrical version). In my experience, buying 1.11 is cheaper, plus it includes the old version in case you're a masochist.   TL;DR make sure there's no zeroes  Evangelion 2.22: You Can (Not) Advance  This time there wasn't even a 2.02 release. Choose DVD or Blu Ray and give Anno your cash.   Evangelion 3.33: You Can (Not) Redo  This one isn't out in the West yet. If you hate dubs with a passion, then you can import a DVD or Blu Ray from Japan, but if you want a dubbed release from Funimation we're still waiting on that shit.   Sadamoto's manga  The official manga has four 3-volumes-in-one releases, plus standalone releases for volumes 13/14. Check Barnes and Noble, they should have something.
this is /r/antibaw material, the second picture was added to mock the first one.

The theory that I accept the most is that humans are actually the only species aware of type match ups. Because of this, Pokemon will ally themselves with a human to better their own chances of survival.
I'm Oedipus-kin and this offends me, you motherfucker.
The End of Evangelion, because it is literally the ending to the TV series. It was what they intended before they ran out of money. It also happens to be one of the greatest films ever made in my own opinion, so absolutely check that out.   After you clean your brains off of the wall behind you, you may want to move on to the Rebuild saga. 1.11 is a remake of the episodes until the fifth angel, 2.22 deviates into its own story, and 3.33 is completely different.

Evangelion and Gurren Lagann tell the same story from two points of view   Neon Genesis Evangelion and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. Two Gainax mechas, considered by many to be the pinnacle of their genre. So is it possible that they're really one and the same?   Both feature a magical power based on the soul of the user, namely AT fields and Spiral Power. They both serve many purposes, the main one being an "explain everything" scapegoat. The main antagonists of the shows (SEELE and the Antispiral) wish to rid the universe of ATSpiral as it is an evolutionary dead end that will lead the universe to destruction.   Let's look at the Antispiral, actually. It's a being formed from the collective souls of a spiral race formed into one. SEELE wanted to complete the Human Instrumentality Project to being their species into one collective consciousness and rid themselves of the need for individual AT Fields. They also have proven to be fans of giant robots, which would explain the Granzeboma. So Gurren Lagann could be a reality in which Third Impact went according to plan, and SEELE got to try and rid the universe of humanity.

The most stereotypical American has to choose an ally. Who will win him over, commies or Nazis?   World War III has been initiated by the Illuminati and now the POTUS is the mot stereotypical American possible: fat, gun-loving, communazi-hating, overly consumerist, favorite movie is probably Saving Private Ryan or something, you know who I'm talking about. The rest of the planet is either ruled by the Fourth Reich or the Communist Empire (I'm creative, I know). Siding with either is a guaranteed victory with the same spoils for America, choosing to side with neither is guaranteed destruction.   EDIT: BONUS ROUND: There is a fourth army in this war, led by Magneto. His army is significantly smaller and the same strength as the Commies and Nazis. Again, the only change in this is who is helping America, they will still win no matter who they choose.
Tenacious D (Tribute) vs Ninja Sex Party (Rhinoceratops vs Superpuma) vs Johnny (The Devil Went Down to Georgia)   Three-way Battle of the Bands. They're only allowed to use their feats from these songs.
Jesus runs a Jesus-figure gauntlet   All of these fighters can be argued as messiah figures after J-Dawg's own image.   This is post-crucifixion Jesus  1: Gordon Freeman. All weapons allowed. (He's beloved, bearded, messianic supersoldier)  2: The Terminator 2 T-800 (Half man, stuggles between being objectively superior to humans and also being a human. Saves the world from its own hubris. Pretty much applies from here on out)  3: Kaworu Nagisa, Evangelion  4: Eva Unit-01, Shinji piloting  5: Eva Unit-01, berserk  6: Post-Crisis Superman  7: Superman Prime 1M  And any others you think should be on the list.
GLaDOS is tasked with killing the Angels (Evangelion)   Cave Johnson has accidentally done a Second Impact. Now, because there is no Gehirn or SEELE in this world, Aperture Science has to be the ones to kill the Angels. They are also housing GLaDOS, who was built from Lilith now. If the Angels get to her, Third Impact will happen and GLaDOS will have failed. She has all the resources available in both Portal and the Half-Life games. Can she do it? Who does she use as a pilot I'd she figures out the Evangelion plans?  Things that now exist from Evangelion: AT fields, the Dead Sea Scrolls Apocrypha, the Lance of Longinus.  GLaDOS can also build Evangelions and the Positron Accelerator, but needs to research and invent them. She has 15 years after Second Impact until Sachiel attacks to build.
Zilla vs Jurassic Park   [Zilla](http://godzilla.wikia.com/wiki/Zilla) (not real Godzilla, the one from the 1998 movie) gets dropped into Jurassic Park during the events of the first movie right after the outbreak, meaning Jeff Goldblum and Samuel L. Jackson are still there.   Round 1: Victory is earned by becoming recognized Queen of the Dinosaurs (to stick it to *real* Godzilla).   Round 2: Victory is earned by not becoming Queen, but her species maintaining a presence on the island living alongside all the other dinosaurs (to pretend she has nothing to do with *real* Godzilla).   Round 3: She, and only she, must murder every creature on the island. No kids, just murder. No presence, just murder.
So the Arceus we see in the games isn't His true form, right?   Arceus is said to have created the universe with its "Ten Thousand Arms", despite having a significant lack of any arms whatsoever. Also, its base stat total is less than that of Mega-Mewtwos X and Y, which shouldn't be possible for a mortal when comparing itself to an Omnipotent. Speaking of which, Arceus can't even learn all the moves in the games. So, there's only one logical conclusion I can come to. The Arceus who appears before Lucas and Dawn in Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum, is not at His fully realized form. Similar to how the Judeo-Christian God appeared before Moses as a perpetually burning bush, Arceus limits His power before stepping into the world of mortals. Because the True Form is a abstract concept, and not necessarily equine, or even perceptible to the human mind. Like Cthulhu, perhaps Arceus exists in a higher dimension, and simply wqants to limit himself to a 3-dimensional form to keep from driving the Pokemon Master insane.   That's my theory, anyway. What do you guys think?

Mewtwo* vs. The multiverse   Mewtwo is sentient like in the movie, with stats and moves from X and Y. He has a completely filled trainer's bag and has again kidnapped Nurse Joy, as well as a move re-learner. He has both Mega Stones, but can only carry one at a time. His Nurse and Move Tutor stay behind when he goes to fight, so if he wants to heal he has to leave and come back. His goal, using the creation trio to travel between universes, is to take all of them over by killing or recruiting (Mystery Dungeon style) all of their strongest fighters. For example, he has to kill every legendary pokemon who refuses to cooperate, every Godzilla monster, the entire Justice League, etc. Can he do it? If not, who stops him?
How do I get the Pimp-Boy 3 Billion on a good character?   My character is liked by New Vegas and I want to keep it that way. The guides I've seen all point me to the bad path, but the wiki says you can complete it and get New Vegas fame and the Pimp-Boy. So how do you meet the "special conditions"?
