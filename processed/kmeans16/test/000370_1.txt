Okay. Thanks. I doubt I'll ever get it back but was just curious.

I'm not sure about a second cat now. I'm a student so I go "home" during the summer months. This was the traveling I was talking about. I'm not comfortable leaving my cat alone for weeks or months at a time even if I get someone to check on him.
Kristen Stewart or Amber Heard would be at the top of my list.
Oh, Tonight
Grab a snack, it's a long list: The Hours, Chicago, Drop Dead Gorgeous, Beautiful, Sugar and Spice, Simone, Miss Congeniality, Looper, Gravity, Unforgiven, The Proposal, The Housesitter, Star Wars: A New Hope, Wag the Dog, All About Eve, Singin' in the Rain, Little Miss Sunshine, Funny Girl.  I made my own movies as a kid, wrote my own scripts as a teen, and watched a lot of movies. I don't watch as many as I used to but these have always stuck out as my favourites whether or not they're critically acclaimed.
Yes and it sucked. I was maybe 9 or 10 and this was at a daycare type center. I cried in the kid's house. One of the girls my age must've seen me cos she gave those were talking about me shit. Also, heard my aunt joking about me but I love my aunt and forgive her 'cos she just likes to joke around.
rdio.com, I'm switching to google play though. If I like an album enough I buy it off iTunes. And if I like the artist enough I actually buy the CD.
A friend actually did this. I thought it was insanely crazy/creepy at the time but he's one of those guys that just says "Fuck it" and does whatever he feels is right. He saw me shopping one day on vacation and decided he had to get to know me so while I was standing around he chatted me up. We became instant friends before I went back home. For some reason he became fascinated with where I came from and made the 16 hour drive to my hometown and stayed a week in a tent behind my parents house and got to know my town and my family. He says its one of the best trips he's made. He's actually the first and only person to ever mention how beautiful my dark brown eyes were. Everyone is quick to compliment blue/green/etc but rarely brown so I was pleasantly surprised.
I hope you told her. I've actually told two of my female crushes how I felt about them. One of them was flattered but straight, and the other was asexual and not interested in starting anything but still remains my friend to this day. I really don't regret telling them.
It seems that way. I've started to divert his attention by grabbing his lure toy when he starts to become aggressively playful. I just don't want him to think it's okay to try to bite and scratch my arms or legs when he's like this.
I have a few: Dixie Chicks, Rilo Kiley, First Aid Kit, Miranda Lambert. I have a ton more but when it comes down to it these are the singers/bands that I'll never tire of.
YES. It drives me crazy when I hear kids/teen saying they are bored. My grandma would lecture me as a kid/teen whenever I said I was bored. My mom would lecture me as well if she heard me say anything about being bored. "Read a book then, there's a bible right there." Uh, no that's okay, I found something to do.
I'm this friend. My hope is I'll arrive on time this time for sure. Nope. Now I know to add 30mins to my ETA. I've been late my whole life and it's hard to change that habit. I felt bad for my one friend. He told me he arrives at the time of the meet up even though he knows I'll be late because he can't stand to be late.
Had one drink at 18. Didn't drink alcohol for years afterwards. Family has a few recovering alcoholics so I just didn't see a point to drinking. First time I got drunk was on my sisters birthday. Made sure to drink a lot of water. Stopped drinking when I felt myself losing my ability to walk straight. Growing up shy and self aware has only made me very aware of how drunk I am. Tipped the waitress alot but I do that sober too.
