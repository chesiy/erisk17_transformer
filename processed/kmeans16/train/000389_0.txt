That is a beautiful vintage ride. Check the tank for rust, if the tires are old they'll want replacing, be sure chain and sprockets are in good shape. Old carbs can varnish, consider a thorough cleaning. The shocks are likely shagged, this era motorbike never did handle well-consider replacing, and the forks need at minimum new oil if not rebuild.  If you're not mechanically inclined consider investing in a professional's care. I know the lads at my local Honda shop (who are a good lot) would LOVE to work on an old girl like yours.  Happy trails!
Here in the USA I wish we had such coppers. Attentive, polite but firm, and a very important public safety goal.  "You have no idea what's going on around you, Madam, so I'll have you pull over in the car park..."  Leading the way, 'Straya, good on ya.
I'll take midges over wasps any day. I wear a full face helmet but keep the visor up unless it's too cold, it's raining or too many bugs. It helps that my GS has an excellent windscreen.  Last summer a damned wasp hit me on the lip-ow! Then stung me OW! before it died.  Did I learn my lesson? Do I ride with a closed visor now? I love the wind on my face, it's like a drug. And I'm stubborn. So no.
Don't be superstitious. I'm more worried about Marquez. The longer you ride wild, the more the chance for a serious getoff. Doesn't he already hold the record for the fastest noninjury crash?
When a patient has been in the hospital for a week and there is a crisis at night when cross cover needs to figure out what is going on the narrative of their hospital course is not optional. If I can't figure it out from the notes I must reconstruct it, which hardly is an advance in patient care. I'll take a pithy, short surgeon's note over the long empty templated progress note anytime.
I delivered liquor  c for Turner's at Sunset and Larrabee in '72. Drugs, sex and general weirdness as far as the eye could see. Even met a few celebs. Joan Rivers was not a nice person, but Dobie Gray was. Jim Hutton (Tim's dad) was a jug a day fellow. Died of liver cancer. Guess I helped kill him, in a way. Saw John Lennon at John Mayall's place in Laurel canyon-my oh my did my eyes bug out.
I gave up on the Shure, too bulky. I use [Klipsch](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0044TVYWG/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8 psc=1) which are cheaper, which is good because they all fail eventually. I bought a couple extra pairs and take a spare with me on rides3-4 days.  I have a modular helmet, and with the front up there's a bit of flex so I can carefully spread the helmet to fit over the ear buds, and once on I can reach in and seat the earbuds carefully.  While many riders use in-helmet speakers I do not because they do not provide hearing protection.

Yes. They probably all "lost" by day 2.
Ain't reddit grand? We have a real informational gold mine here. Between reddit and Wikipedia there is so much groovy stuff to find out. And do you like the Engineerguy? He did a great presentation of Michaelson's [Harmonic Analyzer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAsM30MAHLg)
What a great find, thanks.  [Here](http://www.standard.co.uk/incoming/article9887141.ece/alternates/w620/odyssey.jpg) are Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood November 2014 (photo Glenn Copus)  Edit: found a [slide show](http://imgur.com/gallery/WvyDm) of stills from the production of *2001*
Mixed feelings about that. It's a damned shame that we waste so much of the nation's treasure on something that doesn't help the citizen, like a bridge or a school.  But we'd be fools not to let the world know we will defend the nation-and if need be, on our opponent's land rather than ours.  I do believe that if we need such a weapon that we invest in one with such capacity and durability as we have here.  And of course I can't wait to see her at sea!

[Here](http://www.magnumphotos.com/C.aspx?VP3=CMS3 VF=MAGO31_10_VForm ERID=24KL5347YF) is the link to the portfolio. I couldn't find the name of the town, but it does mention being the last deep coal mine in Wales, facing closure. The [Tower Colliery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_Colliery) and the nearby villages of Hirwaun and Rhigos are possibilities.
Inquiring minds want to know!   Living in Olympia WA geology is in your face and after reading McPhee I've got the bug. I am working through *Earth* 10th ed by Tarbuck *et al*, several books by David Alt *et al*.  Is there a geology equivalent to *Sky and Telescope*? The stuff I see is more oriented to rock hounds. Blogs or forums for amateurs? When I get some time I'd like to ramble around the scablands; any recommended spots? Thx!
