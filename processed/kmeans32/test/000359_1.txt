Bang that shit
A few of my closest friends know I use occasionally and if I'm high they'll usually ask what I'm on and I'll tell them H or oxy. If someone else asks I'll just say I haven't had coffee and I'm tired. I shudder when I try to imagine the fallout that would occur if my parents or any of my extended family found out. But that's the nature of these drugs, you have to be able to keep secrets from certain people.
1. I had tried quite a few drugs (but not nearly as many as some people on here) before trying opiates. One day I was finally able to get my hands on some 5/325 vicodins. Took 2, smoked some weed and had a great time.      2. The high has a physical aspect to it that just isn't there with weed. No matter how high you get on weed you won't experience the same extent of analgesia you get from opiates. Or the "not giving a fuck" type feeling because of how absolutely amazing you feel from the euphoria.      3. I only use occasionally so that my tolerance stays low and so I can avoid addiction.      4. I would say they've had a negative effect on my social life. I've had to hide my use from most of my friends. It really depends on the person but the guilt from hiding it from certain people can get to you after a while. As for the positive aspect, getting high on opiates is better than every other drug I've tried.      5. I've never binged on opiates since I try very hard to space out my usage.      6. Know that physical withdrawals are the least of your worries compared to the social stigma, monetary cost, tolerance, psychological addiction and even death if you shoot up.
Miralax or another laxative.
Yeah I think it popped up in November on the RC market. In my experience 20mg snorted provides brief euphoria that gives way to 2-3 hours of functional stimulation. Less euphoria than EPH but I noticed less vasoconstriction as well. Similar burn to EPH when you snort it. May be caustic. Also, people have reported being pleased with how it vapes off foil and gives a pleasant rush. Personally I wouldn't vape more than 5-10mg though.      For reference I have a moderate to low stimulant tolerance. Remember that RCs can affect everyone differently, so start small with dosing if you get your hands on some. Check out the 3F-phenmetrazine thread on Bluelight for more info :)
Immaculately written. I had to stop at certain points since I was laughing so hard. Now I'm curious to hear the rest.
Thank you for reiterating this point. The top comments in this thread all make excellent points regarding why the White House is incorrect in their analysis, but at the end of the day it boils down to politics. And given the current situation for Democrats, this means walking a fine partisan line to appease the party's usual voters (and corporations/institutions that support the party), especially as midterms draw closer. It seems to me that it's just one of the unfortunate side effects of the influence of money in U.S. politics.
Thousands of hours into Super Smash Bros. Melee. The competitive scene is amazing and I love going to tournaments.

A friend of mine who does light shows (gloving) gave me a light show to the song Do the Astral Plane by Flying Lotus. At the time I was tripping pretty hard on shrooms. I was completely detached from my surroundings for most of the song. It was an extremely intense and immersive experience. I would definitely recommend FlyLo and light shows in general to anyone who's tripping.
I don't understand the appeal of these new languages that mix paradigms such as functional and imperative programming. It seems to me that the popularization of languages such as Swift will inevitably lead to code that incorporates both paradigms within the same program, which can be confusing.      With that said however, it looks to be a big improvement over Objective-C considering the supposed speed and new set of features.
If you're into electronic music, I would suggest Flying Lotus, Boards of Canada, XXYYXX, Emancipator, Tycho and Com Truise.  I would say take care in choosing which Boards of Canada songs you play though since I remember the vibes getting very weird with certain songs. Also, it can't hurt to listen to all the music you're planning on tripping to beforehand so you can carefully choose the vibes you want (i.e. chilled or upbeat).
Kief so loud it wakes the neighbors up [hi-res]

Says Linus is using intimidation and violence. Uses an expletive and threats of "not being a nice girl anymore".  This is very unprofessional and her concerns have been greatly exaggerated. Unfortunately, immature people who can't understand mature humor are everywhere. Dealing with it is the hard part; just recognize stupid when you see it, don't antagonize, and move on.
this is a gif right dude [8[
If this is OC and you're really asking, good luck man.
Razors. Those fuckers are expensive
Depression is unique because there are so many ways we experience it. I am currently in the same boat as you. Most of high school I was stepped on. You just have to keep on living. Friends were a valuable resource when i finally found some real ones. This community is also great because we can let our feelings be known and not feel so alone. Sorry if this post isnt really making a point, I'm just greatful this subreddit is here as much as you.
I have not tried this, nor do i have any experience with edibles, but I came up with this idea while I was really high. So what you would do is bake chocolate sauce with a bunch of kief and dip strawberries and bananas in the resulting sauce. Don't know if this would work...

You're absolutely right about the attitude part. However, the user shouldn't have to choose between familiar/functional interfaces and security (not sure why you called it abstract, do you mean that users aren't aware of how vulnerabilities work?). I use Nightly Linux x86 and first thing I do in the morning is update it, then get on with browsing. If there are multiple updates in one day and it pops up to notify me, I simply press restart to update, wait a WHOLE 5 SECONDS and carry on with my business. Firefox even saves all your tabs for you while you update, so I suppose the point I'm trying to make is why are people so angry about quick updates? My best guess is that the vast majority of users have no idea about major exploits and the consequences of running unpatched software. Feel free to let me know if I'm going in the wrong direction with this though, because what I feel it really boils down to is patience.

Is this a Nas instrumental? (hope I'm not embarrassing myself lol)
I'm a fan of Hopsin. I think he's pretty lyrical. However, the verse about Obama on Nocturnal Rainbows is extremely ignorant if that's what he actually believes. He mentions the Illuminati as if they actually exist...
