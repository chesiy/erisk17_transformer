There's one of these in my hometown that my dad helped build.  They're tearing it down soon and replacing it with something more "modern.". So sad.
This is awesome!  Thank you!
Nope, Minnesota.
VERY true!  In this case you're right, I'm likely ok because it's obviously a brassica.  I normally wouldn't bother trying to eat something like this but there is such a large amount of it that it seems wasteful to not try!
Thanks RonRonner!  We kept her happy and comfortable as long as we could.  She'd had IR problems since she was about 10, and I had to stop riding her about a year before we put her down at the age of only 16.  She had some problems keeping weight on, but never got too bad.  The farm and their staff is incredible, and I credit their expertise and diligent care when it comes to how long she stayed sound and happy.  She is buried on the farm, under the pasture where the new foals play. :)
I met him about a month ago and he was the NICEST guy.  Way taller than I realized (hotttttttttt), and genuinely interested in what I had to say.  I will marry him now please?
Morgans are great little dressage horses!  I have several friends who use their horses for dressage, and now Western dressage is becoming really popular as well.  If you want any Morgan dressage connections, PM me and I can get you in touch with the right folks.  Even though my horse competes in hunter pleasure, we do a lot of basic dressage exercises with him at home, especially now that we're trying to get him better with patterns.  He overthinks everything and jumps to conclusions!  The dressage work is slowing his brain down a bit. :)  Here's a pic of him doing his thing in the show ring because, well, who doesn't love more horse pictures? :)  http://i.imgur.com/TVTI0.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/fs8Fh.jpg
Thank you!  He's a Morgan. :)
Well, I'm not sure if this will clarify much (as reins just tend to look like a tangle), but here is my horse wearing the aforementioned rein configuration.  The bit he's wearing in this picture isn't the same one we're discussing here, but the reins are run in the same way.  Snaffle rein goes directly from hand to bit, and is clipped to the ring of the bit.  Curb rein goes from saddle, through bit ring, and doubles back.  http://imgur.com/PPwAtGI  Closer up:http://i.imgur.com/3YmYWU7.jpg  Hope that clears things up a little!  EDIT: the curb rein also goes through the martingale.  Forgot to say that!
I did look up Indian bits, but didn't find anything that similar.  :/  And as for the rust -- I'm sure that's part of it, but he really likes the fact that it's just a big straight bar and not jointed in any way.  If I could show him in it I would!
You are my hero!  Everyone I show the sign loves it.  My friends in Madison, my aunt in Atlanta, my mom in Illinois -- it's just the kind of humor we need when it's going to be this cold.
This sounds like a fantastic idea.  I just graduated, so I'm not a rec member right now because I'm not currently paying student services fees, but I could get a membership.  As for the other side of the deal, I can teach you cooking no problem, and could also help with men's fashion!  If only I had access to a horse, I could teach you to ride too!  PM me and let's talk.
What a total doll.  I wish my horse would chill out and do this, but he gets too excited and wiggles all over!
That sounds fantastic!  I've really been overwhelmed by the number of people who have reached out to me.  I feel so welcomed already!  I'm eager to get to know the city.  I really love places that are little holes in the wall, so maybe you can show me some lesser known, but still awesome places to eat, drink, and hang out.  I'll let you know when I hit town!  - Nicole
Cute!  Horses are much more "tuned in" to what is going on than people think.
Want.  To.  Exist...
If you can't ride, could you drive?  I'm not sure if either of your horses know how to drive, and I wouldn't suggest trying to train them to do it yourself, but if a knowledgeable person can start them in harness locally, I'd bet they'd take to it quickly.  Driving can really help with your riding too, since you have to communicate through your hands and voice, and it gives you a great "feel" for a horse's mouth.
Can you post a picture of his entire body so we can see his socks?  It would give him a better shot at being ID'd.  I have people I can send his photo and info to, but I know they'll want to see all his markings.
Oh my.
They are an incredibly beautiful family!  Men so sexy, kids so cute!!!!
He actually has TWO thermals, because last Halloween I *almost* got him to go as Dexter.  He looks incredibly sexy in them.  I wish I had pictures of THAT to share with you!
He has such a great beard.  Good beard is key.
Starbuck!  She is super cute!  Mine is Apollo, also after BSG!  (http://i.imgur.com/8OuAw.jpg)
Cool!  And I also hope that there are some LA firms there.  I'll try to check it out if I can get over there after word, and will spread the word among the grad students!
Hey FlameGirl!  I'll go through these one by one:  1) You can do some things to encourage head and neck position, but most of all the horse has to be built for it.  My horse is not, that is is why he because a hunter and not a saddleseat-type horse.  However, assuming the horse is upheaded to begin with, the upheadedness and head carriage come from a) building muscle and b) collection.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Dumb jockeys are used, taking the place of a rider when a horse isn't being ridden.  They help teach a horse the proper "frame" to be in.  When we ride, our hands are elevated to meet the elevation of our horse's head and neck.  While riding, you can bump and tickle your snaffle bit to ask the horse to keep his head up.  Of course, none of this is possible without good impulsion from the hind end.  When a horse pushes off its hind end, it elevates its front end.  There are plenty of horse that go around the ring with their head down because they are not collected and pushing off the hind!    2) I don't know much about rollkur.  I've never seen it used outside of dressage. :/  3) The rider sitting farther back on the horse does not have any ill effects on the horse's back.  Morgans, Saddlebreds, etc. have a center of gravity that is in the middle of their back (they are built in an upright fashion) as opposed to a thoroughbred or quarter horse whose center of gravity is over the shoulders.  The saddles are designed to sit in the middle of the horse's back and the flaps are cut back to free up the horse's shoulders and not impede their movement.  4) Whips are used pretty much like they are in any other discipline I suppose.  Lots of riders show without whips.  I rarely use them, even at home when training.  Sometimes they are carried as a "prop", especially in equitation classes, and I carry one in the ring sometimes because my horse tends to focus and listen better if I'm holding it.  Otherwise, it's just an aid, as it is with anything else.  5)  Many Saddlebreds and Hackneys have had their tail "set".  In other words, a muscle in the underside of the tail has been cut to allow the tail to stretch up and bend over at the top.  Some people think that the tail bone is broken, which is not the case (and would be awful!).  My horse is a Morgan, so this type of procedure is illegal for our breed.  He does, however, wear a bustle in his stall to encourage an "arched" tail carriage.  Desired Morgan tail carriage looks like this: http://www.playmorfarm.com/Play_mor_farms_stallions/stallion_images/centerpiece-thumb-2010-2.jpg  Desired Saddlebred tail carriage looks like this: http://www.goinggaited.com/Born_Contender_al_12-4-06.jpg  Feel free to ask follow up questions!
Thanks for pointing out that this is serious, dizzysparrow.  While it is entertaining, there is quite a bit of pain associated with it.  I partially dislocate things all the time -- they often pop back in on their own shortly after, but that doesn't mean it doesn't hurt.   I've also sprained my left ankle 18 times, usually just by walking down the sidewalk, and my right 13 times.  This to me is "normal".    As for how it effects my daily life, it depends.  I cannot hold a pen for very long, so I take all notes on my laptop when I'm in classes.  Winter is the hardest -- my hands and legs stiffen up and I have problems holding onto things and moving my fingers.  I was in a drawing class this winter where I had to hold a pen for hours.  I would have to come home at night and use hot packs on my hands to ease the pain.  Of course there is the obvious -- I can't run, so fun co-ed sports are out (mostly) and I have to invest in a gym membership to stay fit since I can't just go running (though I do bike in the summer).  I believe that the worst thing about HMS is that people can't tell you have it, and therefore can't understand why you hurt or think you are "whiny".  If you looked at me walking down the street, I look no different than most people aside from a slight limp I sometimes have.  You cannot always see pain.
Songwriters of Reddit: a challenge.  Write my dog a theme song! (xpost from r/dogs)   The dog in question is Apollo, a springer spaniel/golden retriever mix. I often sing to him about his greatness, his beauty, and his strength, but I'm no songwriter, and I think he deserves an anthem of sorts. I know that a song about Apollo would make my boyfriend incredibly happy, so this is a surprise of sorts for him!  First off, here are some photos of Apollo for inspiration: http://pineappleblurt.imgur.com/apollo#38wmp  Now, some Apollo facts:  - I often sing of how he crunches the bones of his enemies, and that he is the destroyer of Tirmok, and had pillaged and burned many villages and thatched roofed cottages.  - Apollo loves the water. He also loves tennis balls, bones, eating, and his eternal love -- our neighbor Deb.  - According to Apollo, no one ever feeds him. Dinner time for him is all the time.  - He was named not for the god Apollo, but for Apollo from Battlestar Galactica.  - He has a superhero alter ego named DarkFart, who fights crime under the cover of darkness.  This doesn't have to be an original melody. Something epic sounding, like the Soviet national anthem, would be incredible. Silly lyrics, about Apollo's unrivaled awesomeness, strength, and beauty, are a must. :D  Forward songwriters! I hope someone accepts my challenge! If I end up with an mp3 of a song all about Apollo, I'll be the happiest girl alive.
Your daughter is seriously cute.  Cutest kid I've seen in a long time!
Merrils are awesome!  Another way to take care of your feet while still being frugal is to get a pair of prescription orthodics crafted by a podiatrist.  While the initial investment is pricey ($200?) they last for-freakin-ever (they are made of a material called Superglass, a type of fiberglass).  I got some 10 years ago because I have extremely high arches and it was killing my knees to walk.  Now they go in all the shoes I wear (except heels) and it really don't matter if I buy cheaper shoes that have no arch support (like Converse) because my orthodics are in there.  Any shoes I want, and no knee pain!
Enchilada bake is the best freakin' thing ever.  Get an 8x8 pan and open a can of enchilada sauce.  Put a little bit of sauce in the bottom so things don't stick, and begin layering -- tortilla, black beans, cheese, sauce, tortilla, beans, cheese sauce, etc. until you get to the top of the pan (usually about 3 layers).  Then top it off with any leftover sauce and cheese and throw it in the oven.  350 for...I don't know...25 minutes?  You know, until it's bubbly and hot-looking and done.    Hella tasty, impossible to mess up, cheap to make, and great for lunches.
I'm just finding this thread now, and I'm thrilled there is a subreddit for horses!  Here are my two Morgans, Baby (chestnut) and Rillo (bay).  Baby is Rillo's mom, so it's a family affair when we show!  http://pineappleblurt.imgur.com/3GH12#49hIR
