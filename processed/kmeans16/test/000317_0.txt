Cabin in the Woods and This is the End exist in the same continuity.   Inspired by this joke: https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/3d5m8z/backstreet_boys_and_nsync_members_are_apparently/ct29g5a?context=3  Anyway, if the sacrifices to keep the "Gods" happy affect every country in CitW, they can effect every religion. Different types of religious/supernatural figures are featured in the movie and various supernatural means are used to defeat the monsters that get unleashed (e.g. the Japanese kids putting their pursuer back to spiritual sleep) One of those in question can be the God/Satan of Christian theology. That hand that emerges at the end of the movie? That's Satan's or a being like it. And then he made his way to LA for This is the End.
No you don't.
I have no idea why this is still around. It sounds so stupid.   "I can't attract anyone who grew up in an environment similar to mine, so I'm going to pay for someone from an impoverished region to come over and hopefully feel obligated to tolerate me until they can save up enough money of their own to leave me."   The power dynamic involved, the resentment I'd imagine she'd likely feel at least subconsciously, etc. Being forever alone sounds much more enjoyable than that.
Way less trippy than some images from the movie: http://i2.listal.com/image/1223189/600full.jpg
Times you lucked out and went into a movie completely blind.   I don't know how I managed it, but when I went to see Gone Girl last year, I knew literally nothing about it except that David Fincher had directed it which I believe massively enhanced the experience for me. I still don't really know what some upcoming new movies are about, but I've heard excellent general things about them so I'm looking forward to being able to go into them blind as well.   This goes completely against my old habits where I would get excited for movies and read several reviews of them, and in hindsight the process would diminish the movies a bit when I saw them in.
That's it! Thanks!
Do you find a lot of the creepy images in this subreddit cool instead?   I'm not trying to claim I'm a badass or anything, I just have a thing that if something is going to creep me out, it usually needs to be ugly or aesthetically unpleasant some way or I'll think it looks good.   For example, I think the images this artist posted (NSFW) http://imgur.com/a/mg9l5 are more beautifully done and awesome than they are creepy. Even this http://i.imgur.com/noEpc2T.jpg is more moody and atmospheric for me than it is cool, but that might be because I used to take walks in the early morning when it was often foggy like that.
Aren't there four artists for it?   Also yes, I thought it was shit from the first comic.
That was actually The Island of Dr. Moreau. Also supposedly he got some police transmissions and such during takes and in the middle of a line would say things "there's a robbery at Woolworth's."  http://thefilmfacts.blogspot.com/2012/12/calling-all-cars-marlon-brando-in.html  For Apocalypse Now, he's clearly adlibing. In the outtakes he says things like "I can't make up any more dialogue for today."
Are there any popular bits of media with sexism that you've never seen commented upon?   For example, I read this article about Clerks: http://www.avclub.com/article/the-new-cult-canon-iclerksi-2239  And I must admit that even though I'd seen the movie before, I'd never thought about it the way he put it. I'd also never heard anyone call the movie on that before either. Do you have any examples that come to mind?

I interacted with them casually for a few weeks at least, then usually I say "hey, you want to go out sometime?" I might be trying too hard to sound like I'm not interested to not come off as desperate, but I get the impression it wouldn't help if I sounded more interested.

This is one of those Creepypastas like Eyeless Jack where the casual tone life-changing stuff is said in makes it accidentally hilarious.   "Hey guys, just so you know, we've gotta, like, kill a bunch of you. Sucks, huh? Now don't try to resist our God who got kinda powerful and shit."
i.e. "Model wants to pander to nerds, asks which member of a local camera crew if they know someone with a room like this, goes and does shoot there."
