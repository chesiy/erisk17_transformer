And if my aunt had balls she'd be my uncle.  But hey, let's talk about what's *actually true*.
Bananas and lemons.
Cut away view shows the inside of the ship.  ... which is exactly what this image does.  What exactly do you think is going on?  You realize you can't actually see the aircraft below deck from the sides, right?  Or see them with their wings folded lined up in rows in the hangar?
Sleat semi-confirms the Ambrose connection; and the Horse and Four was confirmed by Anker.  Also, he was *definitely* committing malfeasance against Kvothe, and Devi didn't sound like she was making up the "he beats his whores" line.
I have asked you to cite the federal power listed in the constitution that allows them to keep states in the union against their will.  ... Jesus Christ, just how many chromosomes are you missing?  The Constitution, by virtue of existing and having no secession clause, creates a binding compact.   You have also woefully misreported the 10th amendment.  Well, I guess either both I and 230 years of Supreme Court decisions are wrong, or someone who can't handle basic logic is wrong.  I mean, the Tenth Amendment relies upon assuming states being part of the existing federal framework.  What's so fucking hard to understand about that?

The term "Obamacare" was in very wide-spread use before Obama himself ever said it.  It's use as a pejorative by Republicans for *five years* before he ever claimed the term for his own is what made the name stick.  Republicans *still* use it as an insult.
Yet a woman who identifies as black is somehow an embarrassment to the left.  A woman who *pretended* to be black, and used that as a way to fraudulently gain benefits and position, and also very likely faked a series of supposed hate-crimes and threats against her.  There's no parallel situation, no matter how desperately you *want* it to be true.
Hmmm.  Spoilers, obviously.  Brys Beddit dissecting Rhulad Sengar.  The Church scene from *Kingsman*.  Logan Ninefingers vs. Golden whateverhisnamewas in *Red Country*.  Mark Vorkosigan taking down Baron Ryoval.  If we include battles, pretty much every major battle written by Steve Erikson in the *Malazan Books of the Fallen*, but especially the Siege of Capustan, the Chain of Dogs, and Second Yghatan.  I'm sure I'll think of more later.
"Get drunk alone and weep bitterly."  It's not for everyone, but I'll figure it'll be popular with redditors.
You have trouble with reading comprehension.
Of course they can learn *about* them.  But such works shouldn't be taught as truth.    And who said anything about denying?  Anyone of any age is generally all right (barring age restrictions, like for pornography) to read whatever they want in their free time.  Saying a child can't be taught a book in school isn't the same as saying they can't read it otherwise.  And you keep bringing up book-burning, which I haven't endorsed.  Do you even know what "strawman argument" means?
Harkness and surrounding area are great, if you want to focus on it for a few days, not really a highlight worth additional driving if you're pressed for time.  Ah, I'm definitely not pressed for time when it comes to the Park.  I live on the road leading to Juniper, so I can make a day trip a few times a week, if I like.
Of course it does.
They would have preferred OBL to remain alive to make Obama look bad.  It's not so much that, as that it didn't happen while Bush was President.  Because, you see, Jesus Cowboy Bush was just *supposed* to bring in bin Laden, "Wanted Dead or Alive Poster" style.  And when that pre-conceived narrative didn't happen, they just couldn't handle the reality of what *did* happen.
As an inner city healthcare worker, how many injuries do you see from assault weapons and high capacity magazines?  That's a good question, unfortunately the Republican controlled Congress of the late-90s banned any research into this.  It's almost like they didn't want to know the answer.
I still haven't made it out to Drakesbad and that whole region of the park. Going to explore that and the Juniper lake region (which I haven't been to either)  I usually don't encourage tourism but ... the east end of the park is better.  I feel kind of dirty for suggesting it, but seriously - head on up into Drakesbad and Juniper.
Please show me a picture of the Russian military crossing the border. Not the Russian military in Ukraine.  You can't have the second without the first, unless you believe in teleportation.  Then again, you probably believe in all sorts of completely insane shit.
An example of the latter is the Adem in The Wise Man's Fear not understanding the connection between sex and pregnancy.  Well ... this one I can give a pass on.  The thing is, the world they live in doesn't function by the same rules as ours - we sure as hell don't have anything like "unbounded principles."  So I honestly wonder if the Adem are right, and everyone else is wrong.  The whole "playing music makes you a whore" thing is just bullshit, though.
I think maybe you should learn English, before posting on reddit.  But it was probably pudding day in the special school you go to, so I can understand if you were too excited to spell correctly, or use particular words in their correct places.
There's a certain fundamental stupidity that is embodied by people who don't understand that diplomacy has a place, even between adversaries.  The U.S. negotiated and signed disarmament treaties with the Soviet Union, a nation that was literally arming other countries fighting and killing American soldiers, a nation that had tens of thousands of nuclear warheads aimed at us.  But the modern Republican betwetting, pants-shitting, sociopathing neocons are blind to history.  They only know that the scary Kenyan Muslim darkie who stole the White House thanks to ACORN is bowing down to Tehran and gifting the Ayatollah with the nukes he'll use to destroy the 51st American state of Israel by ... negotiating to delay Iran's nuclear weapons program.  Or something.  It apparently doesn't have to make sense, outraging Republicans is now as simple as not killing funny-talking brown people.
This is completely and utterly wrong about pine.  It's perfectly fine to use as your sole source of firewood (a lot of people where I live, including myself, do so).  The sap content doesn't really matter when seasoned, and I have no idea what "burns messy" is supposed to mean - it doesn't really generate more ash or creosote than oak or almond.
Hey, look, *ad hominem* attacks.  What a surprise.  But then I thought, hey, everyone knows that.  It sounded like you didn't, which given the ignorance very prevalent on Reddit I took at face value.  And there aren't a *few* exceptions, there are many - let's add perjury, false identification, false presentation, and false police reports for example.
Based on what we've been shown can be done - what innovative uses would you put sympathy and sygaldry to, that the characters don't seem to have thought of?   This was triggered by rereading Kvothe lamenting the cold food in the different rooms the Maer put him in.  ... why is a skilled sympathist complaining about cold food, instead of linking the plates or food to the candles in the room and heating it all up?  Or to a bit of ash from the kitchen fireplace, which would always be going?  So what other things do you think you could come up with - if you were in that world and skilled at both sympathy and sygaldry.  Sygaldric telegraphs would be obvious, if limited by distance (five-to-six miles).
Does anyone even care that Jerry Rice did?  I think the problem is that now, a lot of other receivers from that era can *claim* they didn't, whether they did or not, to make themselves look better.  But much like pine-tar or scuffing the ball for more than a century of major league pitching, we all know everyone did it.
And now it's snowing, at a lower altitude than predicted (4500' where I'm at).  So ... that should be pretty damned helpful.
I actually think that its the Maer.  The Maer Alveron is very likely King at the time of the framing in Newerre - the King's soldiers are wearing Alveron's colors (white and blue), and it's doubtful that there's been enough time for him to have sired an heir, and that heir to have grown up and taken the throne.
My girlfriend and I live in Sacramento where the water is pretty good.  I lived in Davis for quite a while - the water is far worse than Sacramento.  The water towers look neat, but what comes out of them is awful.
What do you prefer to make from scratch, instead of buying processed, packaged, and store-bought?   I'm especially talking about things with complex recipes, where the store-bought version has a long shelf-life but the home-made version has to be used fairly fast.  In my case, it's Caeser dressing - started doing so a week ago, and I'll never go back to the bottled stuff, though there are plenty of decent brands out there.  I still haven't done ranch because of the short fridge-life of buttermilk, but that's probably up next.
