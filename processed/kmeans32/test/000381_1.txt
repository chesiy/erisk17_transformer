Thank you so much. I really appreciate the support and you put a really big smile on my face!

Sperm does determine chromosomal sex, but not gender, and the comment was in reply to a woman's body being affected altering sex and trying to claim that that couldn't be possible.
I just hunted for the picture and damn boy! You look good!
We have been together since we were 15 and 16. That helped for most of our family members, and, she would have had to drop out of school because of financial aid, so her mom got over it really fast.

So do my pups! Mya is Mya-Doodle-Do, Doodle Dog, and Doodle Bug. Reese is Reesey Puff, Fluffer Nutter and Fluff Butt. On a side note, my brother has a dog named Pope that is a black boxer, so I call him George Foremen or Georgie.

I grew up poor and am minimally better off now. My one splurge is clothes. I'm a 20 year old lesbian, and I love the men's section at Aeropostale. The sales are great and the clothes last years longer than anything I've ever bought at Wal-Mart.
There are plenty of gay drag queens, which actually vary from transvestites. Also, you implied that drag queens are gay by implying that they like pegging that you implied is gay.
I'm a genderqueer, butch hair-shy-of-pillow-princess married to a very sexy, femme top. Its great.
Yes, they do.
First off, warts are hardly life or health threatening. It's not like he hid AIDS from you.   We don't know if he would have done the same if it were a dangerous STI. We don't have a way to know that. Perhaps you could communicate about it.   I don't think something like this is worth a break up. You have a right to be upset but I don't think your guy was being malicious at all. I think he was just being stupid and didn't think through the consequences of you getting it, too, since no one else had.
/u/miss_clarity was really just being nice and trying to offer more info to OP. She didn't come flipping out that he was a dick for not using that phrase. Not everyone needs to be politically incorrect all the time, either.
That's a bit different; you initially left out the ADD.
The baby is the first of his generation and my wife is expected to be there. This sister is also her only whole sibling; the other three are from her mom's second marriage, so her father has a weird hang up about it. She doesn't have her licence yet and we both have agreed that she is not to be around her father without me. She doesn't want to be around her father at all so she doesn't want to go, but she is a people pleaser and doesn't want to disrupt the family.
No, I think women just want someone experienced. I'm a lesbian. I would not sleep with or date a virgin. There is just too much responsibility in making sure you don't fuck their first time up. Maybe it's because women put more emotional value in virginity loss and to men it's more of an accomplishment.  All my opinions based on generalizations of course.
It's rarely relevant. Most people don't even know what it is and my preferred pronouns are obvious from my appearance, so there is no need to express such.
Yes and no. One can simply identify as genderqueer, which is something of an umbrella term, and not wish to make any changes. I don't identify as 100% man 100% of the time, so I feel transman isn't fitting, but genderqueer is, however I am actually making an effort to transition just toward what exactly isn't quite defined.   Edit: I'm the only female child in my family so female pronouns. I don't want to hurt my parents.

1. Lemon juice had citric acid, which is awful for you. Look for it in ingredients when shopping.  2. Huge granulated sugar is not good. Chemical exfoliation is better for you.   I'm sure there are others but that's what jumped out at me.  Edit: apparently I'm wrong. Live and learn.
I could say it ain't so but darlin, what's the use?  The darker the chocolate yhe richer the taste  Now if that's where it's at then run and tell that!   I didn't know the soundtrack to Hairspray was considered rap.
How do you guys feel about relationships with lesbians?   I'm transmasculine/genderqueer and currently identify as a lesbian. I'm married to a beautiful woman who, despite being 100% certain that she is gay, completely supports me and recognizes that top surgery is an inevitability and is fine with that. I know I will probably transition one day, if I can be sure it means not losing my family, but I know my wife will continue to identify as a lesbian and that is fine by me. Other transguys I know have dated girls that identify as lesbians and I have seen some relationships go from lesbian to straight.   Have any of you guys had relationships like this? Would any of you begin a relationship with a woman who identified as a lesbian? I'm not looking for validation; I'm trying to start a conversation.
Last night, I snapped and told my parents that I had depression and no one cares. So far they've proven me right. But it might be a good thing.   About me: I'm 20F and married to a woman. I identify as nonbinary but my mom said I can "get a sex change ten years after" she's dead. My wife is also 20. We've been together nearly five years.  A bit of back story; I had this job working with a guy with Down syndrome. I loved it. I love him. The agency doesn't pay regularly and every two weeks, when my pay was due, I was crying because they somehow fucked me over. This caused me to lose my apartment. I have since quit the job. During my last week, the last week of January, the master cylinder in my car went so I have no brakes. I used my dad's truck for work, and emailed my professors that I couldn't be on campus. I have not gone to class in two weeks and am at risk for being dropped from 18 credits and losing my financial aid.  Last night, he comes home from work and starts yelling at me that the truck is damaged and I drove it last. We live in a college town and have several houses on our street that have college kids. One had a party Friday night. Apparently someone drunk ripped off his mirror. I said I had nothing to do with it, which I didn't, and he starts yelling that I wasted a ton of gas and abused my use of the truck. When I told him that I hadn't used it except to go a mile each night but that on Friday I had a ton to do to get my car fixed, and that I was at risk for failing out of school, he yelled at me that it wasn't his fault and that if I didn't run my car into the ground this wouldn't have happened.   I told him the master cylinder went on a 10 year old car and there was nothing I could have done. I went  upstairs to grab my stuff to leave and he yelled "don't forget to slam your door" in the douchiest tone possible.   As I went down the stairs, I said "I'm depressed and can't afford counseling and nobody in this house cares!" And then I left. I called my best friend crying and he came to hang out with me in a local Rite Aid. We tried to drive my car but the brakes are completely gone so my dad told me to take his truck, no reference to previous conversation. My mom hasn't mentioned it either.   She had known that I was seeing a counselor at my college for about three months and knew it ended with the last semester. She hasn't mentioned except, when I told her I was going, to say that I was "stronger than that". She has known for five years that I have panic attacks but says that's I'm over dramatic.   How it's a good thing: I have been not going to the hospital for help because I didn't want to disapoint anyone. They don't care. I'm free to go.   TL;DR: life sucks, then what?
In response to skin obsession making another poster unhappy, caring about my skin had helped me learn to care about myself.   I have diagnosed clinical depression and anxiety and have for almost a decade. For me, that means insomnia and not caring about myself at all. Typically, an adult can bounce back and at least bother to do the bare minimum. I was 11 or 12, though, and not caring developed into terrible habits, that, at 20, I'm still struggling to kick.   When I joined reddit a bit over a year ago, and came across SCA, I subscribed because I've always been lucky to have great skin, so I figured I might enjoy learning to actually wash my face. It took another nine months or so before I actually used it, but hey, I did eventually.   Since then, I've started to remember to brush my teeth regularly. I know, gross, but being young and depressed is making bad choices. I've also started to drink water almost exclusively. I'm chubby, by like a lot, and have always been the kind of kid to cut gym class and hang out somewhere else, even if somewhere else is a bathroom. I've started using my college fitness center by choice.   SCA has really helped me make some positive changes in my life, and I thank all of you for that.
I think my (20 F) father (60 M) just threw me and my wife (20 F) out.   I'm pretty upset for good reason and sitting in a McDonald's typing this, so sorry if it's all jumbled and fucked up.  We recently moved back in with my parents because my job doesn't like to pay me correctly and we couldn't keep up with our rent. My 18 year old brother is prince of the mother fucking earth. He does whatever the fuck he wants, including, tonight, when he came in the bathroom while I was showering and turned on the sink water and started flipping out and calling me names because I let his stupid ass dog in his room so it wouldn't shit on my goddamn flood. Big surprise, the fucking puppy shit on the floor. He should have taken the fucking dog out or put it in it's crate if he wasn't going to be able to take it out. I told him to turn the water off because the family dog had just puked all over me and I was trying to get cleaned off. He wouldn't. I told him to get the fuck out of the bathroom. He said "Or what, you'll sit on me?"   I ran to my room and got dressed. I went downstairs and told my parents that SOMETHING needs to be done about their goddamn hellion. My dad said "I hate to say it, but I think it's time you find a place to live." My wife and I left and came to this McDonald's. I don't know what the fuck to do from here. We have no money, about 200$ in food stamps and a quarter of a tank of gas. I have to work tomorrow and I know they won't fucking pay me anyway. We just finished the last day of our semester of college, so switching to dorming isn't possible right now. I don't know what to do.   If you're just commenting to tell me I'm awful, please, save it.    ---    **tl;dr**: My brother's the best and I think I'm homeless.
I revamped my subscriptions today because I think they were making my depression worse.   I hope this is okay here; just subscribed today and this is my first post here. Sorry if it's not okay.   I unsubscribed from a lot of the defaults with the whole "bro culture" thing going on and am hoping it will help, since I let the comments and what not affect me too much. If it doesn't help, I'm probably going to leave reddit for a while, or at least delete the app from my phone, because for the last year, my depression has gotten worse and the main change has been my use of reddit that has gone up drastically, especially over the last several months. I dunno. I guess I'm just trying.
My girlfriend acts like a little girl.   She is 20, almost 21, and we have been together for over four years. She is likes to talk about fairies and princesses and has this intense love for all things "cute and chubby" as she puts it, meaning adorably pudgy dogs and bunnies and the like. She loves to tell bedtime stories before we go to sleep, which usually either center around fairies, princesses, or horses. She is obsessed with horses, but without a real desire to own one.  It's the cutest thing in the world. I can't wait for us to get married in a little over a week. I hope she never grows up.
Didn't know where else to put this. An open letter to the trans* lady I saw in Walmart ladt night.   Ma'am, You passed so well that after walking away from you my girlfriend and I commented to each other on it. I assure you no one else was reading you. But I did. I read you when we made eye contact and you looked terrified that you thought I knew. It wasn't your height, even though you stood several inches above my 5'5". It wasn't your face, which was just as feminine as any other lady's face. It was your lack of confidence and fear that made me see any other indicators. I wanted in that moment so badly to hug you and tell you it was all okay and not to be so worried. Walmart at midnight may not be the safest place, but it also isn't the worst. No one even knew. You were just as safe as all other women in that store were and I wish there had been a way for me to communicate that to you. I hope my subtle smile and aversion of my eyes after our eye contact didn't further freighten you or make you think you didn't pass. I am proud of you for being yourself and presenting in public. I hope youbhave the courage to do it again, and maybe next time, if I see you, I'll have a better way to show you that I support you.   Signed,  The Lesbian from 2368.
I live in PA and want to use my security as last month's rent as I don't trust management.   I have lived there a year and paid a lot of late fees because my job keeps witholding and fucking with my pay. I couldn't save at all because I was paying sometimes 40 a month extra in late fees because of my job. I have also recieved three 10 day eviction notices. The first was for being 10 days late, the second for seven, the third for 2. I had never missed a payment, only paid late. My landlord recently broke my car window and has done nothing toward paying for it. I only have until 10/15 left in the lease and last rent is due 9/15. The entire length of my tenancy the management company has been shady and rude and I don't believe I will see a dime of ny security despite making no damage. I am not worried about future tenancy as I will be living with my parents for some time from then on and can use them to get a new apartment down the road if need be.   What will happen if I don't pay?
Pigs are people too!
