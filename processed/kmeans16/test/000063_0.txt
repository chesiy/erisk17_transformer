That's puzzled me the most. Aside from the room in that diner, I haven't seen a single body anywhere.
screamlouder.info   I'm hoping this works. God damnit, I'm fucking praying this works. It hasn't the last hundred times but maybe this will be the one that gets a response. I don't know how many more places I can post this. I feel like theres nowhere left to shout my message.  According to this computer, nobody has responded on any other site I visit, not just to me but to anything. Nothing ever gets updated, I don't see new statuses on Facebook, and I'm starting to wonder if this computer is even connected to anything at all.   If this does work, here's the first thing I need anyone who sees this to read: FIND ME. Please.   I cant really help you with this because there's nobody around to tell me where I am, but please try anyway. I haven't seen anyone since I got here and I haven't found any other ways to make contact. The phones are broken, the radios are weird...I happened upon this computer a few days ago and it seems like my only chance of getting out of this place.  Sadly I can't give you so much as a hint as to the name of this place, I haven't found any signs that say anything about a location. I'd tell you my name if that could help but first I need a response. I need to make sure I can trust whoever's on the other end, I hope you can understand.  Maybe a backstory is enough for now? I'll start with the last thing I remember before waking up here: I was excitedly preparing for a month long vacation from work to a pretty nice resort spot in Jamaica. I had a bunch of unused PTO, I was knee deep in code at work and I figured I needed a break. Hell, my coworkers were begging me to take time off. Apparently I looked exceptionally tired. As a web developer working for at least 30 different clients from a particularly small web firm, Id have to agree with them. The work was indeed exhausting. There's nothing too interesting about all this, but it's what led to the following events so I'm not sparing any details. I can't afford to, ya know?  I had just finished packing my car, my neighbors were ready to start collecting my mail, and I was about to head to the airport for my much needed R R when I remembered I wanted to take a decongestant so my ears wouldn't pop on the plane. I headed to the tidy kitchen in my lonely little house in the suburbs. Everything was spotless and as it should be which gave me comfort knowing it would be this way on my return. It was nice knowing I could just leave everything behind for awhile without worry. I needed a change of pace.   At least thats how I felt back then.   I grabbed a pill from my medicine cabinet. As a frequent allergy sufferer, I'd done this hundreds of times before so I wasn't paying attention as I popped the pill and chased it with a glass of water....god, why wasn't I paying attention?  I looked in the pill bottle as I was closing it and noticed the pills were the wrong color. What? They were supposed to be pink but these ones were white. They had never been white. Someone had been in my house and switched the pills...  Panic came over me instantly, I knew I had to act fast but I was stuck in that moment where you don't know what comes first. My heart was racing as I made up my mind. After a few moments of jumbled thought, I finally ran to the sink to make myself throw up.   but then my heart stopped racing. Then the panic went away.   I couldn't even reach up to my mouth to stick a finger down my throat. I closed my eyes and my face began to feel like cotton. My knees buckled and I collapsed. Moments before I blacked out entirely I could feel something grabbing my legs and pulling me across the floor.  I awoke with a pounding in my head and the kind of dry throat where swallowing seemed to make it worse. The fear returned as if I had just been in my kitchen minutes ago, but the change in my surroundings told me it must have been much longer. I was in a broken spring bed with quilted blankets. There were dusty knick knacks and old furniture scattered about the bedroom and the walls were made of unfinished wood. It all reminded me of my grandparents cabin in the forest back home.  I creaked my aching bones out of the bed that was holding me. It felt like I hadn't moved in days. I made my way to the bedroom door, hoping to find a sink somewhere in this old place. I was so thirsty.  Upon exiting, I had to catch myself by grabbing hold of the doorframe. This was the second floor of a cabin that had been torn in half. The staircase and walls in front of me were completely gone, leaving a giant opening to the world outside. Everything else was in shambles. It looked like a tornado must have hit here.  I gazed out at the horizon. I was at the top of a small hill, surrounded by thick forest. There were tall mountains on all sides of this tiny valley, trapping the forest like a prison cell. At the bottom of the hill, following a clean paved road was a town. Early on, I was reassured by the sight of civilization.  I jumped down from the crumbling hallway onto a couch covered in cabin debris. The small bit of good news I found here was a sink at the back of the kitchen directly behind the couch, now completely exposed by the lack of separating walls.  The rusty faucet knob creaked as I turned it. I expected crisp, cool mountain water but instead a thick black sludge came oozing out. useless.  Instead of wasting my strength here, it was time I headed to the town below in search of water and hopefully an idea of where I was. After escaping the wreckage, it was nice to find solid footing even if it was unfamiliar ground. The walk down the road was almost pleasant, if not a little eery. It was quiet. Absurdly quiet. The leaves didn't rustle, there wasnt an animal in sight to make chirps or squeaks. The clouds were dark and heavy, but there was no rain, no wind. There was no change, everything seemed stagnant.  There was a gas station at the top edge of town along my descent. A sign across the entrance said shop quickly which puzzled me, but I was far more distracted by what I realized next. There was nobody filling up the cars parked by the fuel stations. There was nobody inside buying sodas or cigarettes. I walked up to the window of the station and there wasnt even anyone manning the register.  The door was unlocked. Hellllooooo?! I shouted as I grabbed some snacks and drinks from the shelves. I was met with no response, so I left some money on the counter and made a swift exit. Oh right, I used money from my wallet. This lead me to realize my captor had left me with my wallet, id, credit cards, and everything else I had on my person. What was going on here? What did they want from me?  The bottled water was stale but it felt good on my throat. I kept walking into town as I munched on some nearly expired potato chips. The buildings around me were old and poorly kept, full of broken windows and dented street signs. Street lamps had toppled over and cars were crashed into each other everywhere. Perhaps it was from the storm that destroyed that cabin on the hill. Maybe it was something else. I wouldnt know until I found someone with answers.  Yet there was no one to find! Everywhere I looked was empty. I thought I saw a shadow of someone in a window once but when I looked back they were gone. Later I thought I saw someone again but it was just a mannequin in a shop display. Its head was missing and in its place was that same black sludge from the faucet earlier, dripping slowly down its neck.  The more I looked, the more I noticed this sludge on random things across town. It was wiped on signs and billboards, fire hydrants, counter tops and registers in shops, and an old phone box on a street corner. A phone box? That meant a payphone! Here was a chance to finally call someone! I wish I had remembered to put my cell phone in my pocket before the kidnapping but I was too panicked to remember. This was just as good though, or at least I thought at the time. I put a coin in the slot and waited for a tone.  Now remember how I said the phones were broken? Well broken isnt exactly the word. Something much stranger was happening. Its one of several reasons I want to leave this place immediately. There was a dial tone after the coin had fallen into place but I hadnt pressed any of the numbers. There was a sound of connecting to the other line and everything after that I could hardly explain, but Ill try.  I was only listening with one ear but the sound was somehow binaural. It was all around me like surround sound, but the quality was still that of an old payphone which was a new and chilling sensation. I heard loud wind and thunder, windows crashing and muffled screaming as people ran by. I instinctively darted around trying to avoid the sounds like they were real. I was afraid something was going to break through the glass box I was in. There was the sound of a car running into the broken streetlamp in front of me and I heard the metal bending as if it was falling over for the first time.  Suddenly, just as it had started, everything stopped and I was left with the buzzing sound of silence. The air around me felt electrified and hot. After a moment of reprieve, I heard the thing behind me.   That moaning.   Ill never forget the sound. I could almost feel its vibrations on the back of my neck.   I slammed the receiver down and closed the payphone door behind me. I wasnt going to use another phone in this town as long as I was trapped here. I hurried down the street in front of me. then I passed down another. and another.   and another.   It was all the same! There was nothing! There was no one! All the exits from the town lead into dense forest followed by mountains that I couldnt possibly climb without gear. I was trapped here with nobody around to help me. I broke down and cried pathetically and without restraint. Why was this happening to me?! What had I done to deserve this? If they didnt want my money, what did they want from me?!  Then I heard it. Through my sobs was a voice talking in one of the buildings. FINALLY! Someone to talk to. There was someone here that could help me! I dashed inside the building where the sound was coming from. It looked to be an old radio station. There were big bold letters spelling out RMR behind the secretarys desk. The front door was removed from its hinges and missing, along with all the other doors inside.  I could hear a man speaking casually to someone on one of the floors upstairs, I was so relieved. I ran up the stairs like a child on Christmas morning, careful to avoid the chunks of concrete that had fallen from the ceiling. It was once I reached the sixth floor that I knew I was close to the source. I walked past the open rooms until I saw where the sound was coming from.  In the third room on the left from the stairs was the station control room. There was an old record spinning on a vintage record player next to a dusty microphone above all the station controls. The record was making that snapping, crinkling sound that old records do. The man speaking on the record must have been a disc jockey from an old 50s radio show. I had caught him in the middle of a news bulletin as I walked into the room. Heres the word from the bird, looks like a storm tonight, and its gonna be a doozy. To all you paper shakers and big daddys playing back seat bingo out at the passion pit, dont be a wet rag and get yourselves home. Heres a little something to help you lay a patch. Play that number, Suzy!  Just as he finished his sentence the record cut out to the most shrill high pitched sound Id ever heard. It was so loud it sounded like it was coming from inside my head. Then it switched over to radio static mixed with a gurgling sound like someone was shouting underwater. The sound hurt me to my core, I could feel it inside me, invading my brain. I grabbed the record player and threw it against the wall and watched it smash into dozens of pieces. What the fuck was happening here?! I felt like I was losing my mind! I flipped the radio controls hoping to reach someone.  Is anyone there? Can you read me? Hello hello! I must have flipped every switch in there but it was no use. There was no response. Nothing. Then there was a knock. It came from out in the hall. After the phone and the radio I became suspicious of pursuing any more sounds, but what choice did I have? If I waited here in this town long enough I would die. The food would expire, I would run out of clean water, and that would be it. I didnt have the luxury of just hiding away and I certainly wouldnt make it in the forest. I wish Id paid more attention in Boy Scouts.  Another knock. I was terrified, but I slowly inched my way out into the hall. I went past three more open rooms and found the source. this was the only room in the whole building that had a door. Next to it was a small desk with a drawer. The knocking continued.  is anyone there? There was another knock. Hold on, Im going to open the door. I jiggled the handle. No good, it was locked. I shifted to the table and opened the drawer. As I expected there was a key. Actually there were six keys. I wondered what the other five were for. I grabbed the first and slid the key into place. There was a click and the door unlocked.   Okay, Im coming in. I said with a shaky voice. I opened the door and there was another knock.   In front of me was another door.   Now I understood what the other keys were for. Whatever was behind here needed to be kept hidden. It needed to be kept restrained. So much so that one door wouldnt be enough. I was trembling as I reached for another key. I knew it was stupid but I didnt know what else to do. Whatever brought me to this town couldnt be behind this door. You cant lock it from the inside. That means its still out here so Im in just as much danger. I unlocked another door.   Another knock.   The knocks were getting louder, whatever it was seemed to be growing impatient. I reached for another key and unlocked another door. Please, stop knocking. Im going to open the doors okay? Im coming in. but it continued. I unlocked another door and the knocking stopped. Now it was slamming itself into the door with full force. Boom! I could almost hear the door cracking on the other side. I didnt know if I should continue at this point because the thing inside was getting aggressive. then again, maybe they needed help just like me. Maybe if we could work together we might be able to get out of here. I caved and let myself unlock another door. BANG! It slammed again. Then there was just one key. One more door. The booming was so rapid and the door looked as if it was breathing each time the thing rammed into it. I was so scared but I wasnt going to give up. BOOM! Another crash into the door. Curiosity was taking over me and I had to know what was waiting on the other side. BANG! Another slam against the wood. I grabbed the key from the drawer and slowly clicked it into place.  The banging stopped. The knocking stopped. It was silent. I slowly turned the metal handle, with no idea what might be on the other side. Whatever it was, it needed six doors just to be contained. There isnt a thing alive that needs that much restraint. My brain was screaming at me to turn around and leave but Id already committed. I was about to see what was inside.   I swung the door open.   The room inside was caked in dust. there was black and white checkered tile flooring and no windows to be seen. Above were fluorescent lights that flickered, struggling to stay lit. It looked like nobody had stepped foot in here for years. I was tense and proceeded cautiously. There was nobody inside. There was nothing here. No tables or chairs, completely empty. I started to sigh in relief when I heard something. It was the whir of a computer turning on. In the center of this otherwise empty room was an old beige computer. It booted up with the classic windows 95 sound, although very offkey, like the internal sound card was broken far beyond repair.  I was still pretty terrified, but at least now I had a computer. Albeit an old one. I saw an internet cable running out of the back, the monitor was functional, things were looking up a little.  I sat down in front of it. I really wish there had been a desk but it was just sitting alone in the middle of this dusty floor. That might explain why the sound was off and the colors were wonky. The dust had probably been getting into all the circuits over the years, I was lucky it even booted up at all.  It loaded the windows 95 user interface with only one icon on the desktop. No My Computer, no recycle bin. Just Netscape Navigator directly in the center of the screen. I double clicked it. The dial up window appeared, but instead of boxes for my information or a place to put in the ip address, etc. it had a single button that said connect?  It was weird that the button had a question mark. It was almost like it was asking me a question instead of giving me an option. I clicked it and waited. Suddenly the old dial up tone started but it sounded completely wrong. Later I managed to search youtube from this computer so I could provide you with an example of what it sounded like because if you hear it youll understand why this doesnt just seem like a broken sound card. Youll know why Im so afraid and why I want to be found.   Trust me though, what youre about to hear isnt nearly as terrifying as what I heard, its just the closest I could find:   [Dial Up sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF2v32xCD0Y)   Its been a few days now since finding the computer. Nothing too strange has really happened since then. I keep finding more black sludge around town as Ive been exploring peoples homes for food and water. The sludge seems to appear most commonly on the front doors of homes, but also on many of the beds where I assume people slept. I moved a mattress that didnt have any sludge into this computer room so I could be nearby in case I get any replies. Im still not sure if Im connected but I seem to have access to everything on the internet so well wait and see.  So if anyone is out there and youre able to read this, please let me know. Im screaming across the web for help because Im very scared and very lonely! The clouds outside are getting darker every day and I still dont know where the person who took me here is, or what was knocking on those doors. If anything new happens or if I come across anything on this computer, Ill be sure to post an update. Bye for now  UPDATE:  What you're about to see (if you can even see it) might not make much sense. I found something on this computer yesterday that shook me to my core.   Please tell me if you can go to:   www.screamlouder.info   I dont know if anyone can, and I dont know if anyone should. I didnt even know people could see my first post until recently.   The link was just sitting there in a .txt file, tucked away in My Documents with a single line reading To help you scream at night. I didnt need to click on it. I shouldnt have. but what would you do, being trapped in a place like this? I said I wanted answers and I got them. I honestly cant tell if this is just a joke, or a pet project from someone at the radio station. Someone with time on their hands and a sickness, remedied only by their own grand delusions.  but I guess Ive recently developed some pretty awful delusions as well. Its been two weeks now, and aside from the stuff I mentioned in my first post, there hadnt been much activity until yesterday. I dont know if its the paranoia setting in after finding screamlouder.info, but Im seeing things now. Hearing things. Moving shadows in the abandoned remnants of homes, the sound of wind where I cant feel a single hair move above my head... And all your comments, Ill read them but sometimes they dont look right. Sometimes they sound wrong in my head. They scare me. Then I look again, and I understand that Ive received nothing but kind words and different methods to get out of here.  That reminds me, I tried to leave. It was 2 days ago. I thought there might be a path through the mountains somewhere. I packed a backpack full of food and supplies and made my way through the forest. After a mile or so, I came to a river. Completely black. The sludge blocked my way.  I followed it all the way around town and back behind the cabin on the hill. Ive been on an island this whole time! I found a road leading to a bridge west of the radio station, but it had collapsed into the sludge below. I threw a log into the stuff at one point to see if I could swim through and it sank like itd fallen in tar. I imagined myself in place of the log, slowly sinking, deeper and deeper until the black ooze filled my lungs. I wept.   Im losing hope by the minute you guys, and I dont know how much more I can take. Worse than everything though, was last nights incident   It was maybe 11 or 12 oclock at night and I couldnt sleep. Too many questions were buzzing in my head. I decided to go for a walk to clear my mind and get some air. Typically a fools choice this late at night, but strangely the electricity still works here and the street lights were lit up on all the poles that hadnt fallen. It provided me with sight and a sense of security. With or without light though, If it meant getting away from that computer room for awhile, Id take my chances.  Id just passed the street where I laid out some parking cones reminding me to stay away from that awful payphone, when I noticed a building that I must have seen a dozen times but never really bothered to look at. Through the windows I could see chrome rimmed tables and chairs, booth seating stretching from one end to the other, and framed pictures of places around town I could already identify (Im becoming too familiar with this place, god I want to leave). The sign above the building was brightly lit with some of the letters burnt out. Au_ie _ays Diner This must have been the diner from that website. I hated the thought of exploring unfamiliar territory after dark but I needed to make a connection, find some semblance of understanding in this place before I could sleep again. If this yokal restaurant had real answers waiting for me inside, nothing could keep me out.  The front door swung open effortlessly. Looks like the locking mechanism had been torn off in the storm. To my right in this darkened room was a lightswitch that, after several flicks from my hand, proved itself unusable.   click   The flashlight I took from my stash of emergency gear shot a stream of light at the kitchen behind the front counter. Hundreds of empty pie tins were stacked from floor to ceiling, covering every square inch of the room. Award winning pies was an understatement for this level of disarray.  Stumbling over broken plates and stray tins, I wandered into the hallway behind the counter in search of a circuit breaker. I kept my eyes forward and alert while I brushed my hand against the wall, hoping to catch the change from wallpaper to metal. Near the end of my path, I felt a wet spot. Shivers went down my spine as I shined the light on my fingers.   Black.   Hoping it wasnt what I thought it was, I brought my fingers to my nose and sniffed.   It smelled like berries and corn syrup. Thank god, just pie filling.   I shined my light over to the spot on the wall Id just touched, and noticed a crease in the wallpaper. I followed it up the wall and then over and down again. It was in the shape of a door. Someone had sealed a room off from the rest of the diner.  Hundreds of pie tins crashed as I shuffled my way into the kitchen. I needed a knife to cut through the paper. I spotted one on the stove that was covered in pie filling. It seemed like thats all theyve been serving for a long time now.  I returned to the door, put down my flashlight, and dug the serving knife into the wall where the creases lay. As I dug, I noticed a flow of air from the room. It carried with it a sickly sweet smell. The scent of a secret decayed by neglect.  After I sliced through the perimeter, I felt for the spot where a knob should have been. Instead there was a hanging ring handle inlaid into the wood of the door. After cutting a hole, I grabbed the handle and pulled. The inside was dark. I heard a drawn out gloop and squelch as something from the ceiling fell to the floor. I picked up my flashlight and peered inside. The walls and ceiling were coated inches thick in blackberry filling. It looked like week old coagulated blood, and it didnt smell much better. I held my shirt above my nose to keep from inhaling too much of it. I quickly shined my flashlight around the room and there in the back corner was a blob of flesh. Man or woman I wasnt certain but they must have been five or six hundred pounds if not more. They sat there completely naked and lathered in pie filling, motionless against the wall. They must have added to the stench weeks or even months ago. It was a renaissance painting of the path to hell via gluttony.   I stumbled backwards with dry, night-terror screams. I couldnt handle this, none of it made sense, and I needed to leave! NOW! but I couldnt feel my legs! I just stood there motionless in the dark, completely escaped from my body, repeating in my head what the fuck is happening?!  Then I caught my breath, eyes returned to focus, and I booked it without looking back. I screamed through the empty town, with no response but my own echoes off the nearby rubble. I ran up the stairs of the radio station, tripping over myself on the way. I hid in my bed for the rest of the night, eyes wide open peering through my sheets. unblinking.  That brings us to now. I knew this, more than ever, was when I needed to call for help again. I see your comments, I know youre out there...I just wish I knew you were real and not just in my head. I cant believe any of this! How does a place like this exist and more importantly, who or what killed the person in that hidden room? I know I said I was lonely before, but now I pray more than anything that Im alone.   I'm not ready to give up on leaving this place quite yet. I'll keep you all posted if anything else happens.
I think that more than anything is what scares me. Nobody else has used this computer. I don't know how they found out about my post and I don't know how they updated the site so quickly. Maybe when I've gone out scavenging for food and supplies they've come into this room and done things. Or perhaps there's another computer still working somewhere else in town. I'm not certain how alone I am anymore.
I should have mentioned the monitor off button. Whoever did this doesn't want you to disrupt the signal.
So you can see it too?! First nobody could see my posts and now this? Things keep changing and I don't know what's happening. I shouldn't have told you to go there. I don't know what will happen to you if you do.
please stay.
thank you Linkoban. Every comment like this brings me back to reality. If even an hour goes by now without hearing from someone, I start to lose my grip. I'm learning things that don't seem right and I need to get out of here now. Please don't go.
I'm so glad you're here. I replied to your comment above. Thank you so much for the kind words. I really needed it, staying strong on my own is scary. Please stay.
I haven't so far, but it's getting harder. I keep finding it in more and more places. Sometimes I wonder if it's spreading. I'm so glad I'm getting through. If this isn't real, I don't even care. It's so good to be talking again.
To anyone complaining about the delay   Shame on you. Can you imagine how the Mother 4 team must feel right now? They're trying to do something great WITHOUT pay in the few hours of free time they have outside jobs and school and this is what they get in return. Insults and accusations? THEY OWE YOU NOTHING! Even if this game never came out (even though they've assured us otherwise) it's still the closest we have to more mother content and that should be enough. It's still a beacon for mother fans everywhere that this game series is still loved and that love is shared. It's a message for Nintendo that our admiration for the series lives on. Also, I really hope you all think about the kind of damage you might be doing to this project. The mother 4 team is full of real people who can also be discouraged like real people. Now more than ever they need our support. Nothing would make me want to drop a project faster than to receive this kind of feedback from all sides. Count yourselves lucky that they haven't pulled the plug. Also I hope the mother 4 team sees this and knows that there are still many people who do believe in them and don't care if it takes months or even a year. This is too important to give up on, I'm rooting for you. *attempts to pray*
oh, I was commenting on mother 4's development time. Although I'm wondering has it been longer? I know I hadn't heard about it until it was quite a ways in.

Palms Tower (Part 2)
[61206c6f737420736f756c] [61206c6f737420736f756c] [61206c6f737420736f756c] [61206c6f737420736f756c] [61206c6f737420736f756c]
What the hell! I'm pegging this on a hacked account. Maybe it's a weird ad-bot thing that's replacing my text on submitting it? I don't really get why the text is so weird though. If anybody has some feedback, please post in the comments. I'll be doing some research on my end as well.
Palms Tower   I think it's funny that movies always have a part where somebody says don't go looking for trouble or you won't like what you find when someone starts digging for info. It's funny because nobody does that in the real world so finding something out is almost always super easy. People love to gossip, right? It fills the gaps in boring work conversations and makes daily life seem way more interesting. You all do it, don't even deny it.  The problem is when everybody that's sharing the same gossip has a minor detail that's different in their version. Like who the fuck was your source? Why would anybody change the story? It's usually never a very interesting detail anyway.  That's not the issue here though. This time not one of the answers was even the same. So let me start from the beginning.  About a year ago, I moved into a really fucking sweet apartment on the outskirts of **[74686520636f6e667573696f6e206f6620746f6e67756573]**. I'm sure you all know that the rent here is cheaper the farther out you go. (if you don't, there's a little pro-tip for you, free of charge) The buildings usually look like they should be out of your price range too, but they're not. I got extra lucky at my place with a corner loft on the top floor with a vaulted ceiling that stretches really high so the whole thing is super spacious and comfy. Or it would be comfy if it weren't for the construction behind the apartment. It started about 3 months after I moved in and hasn't really stopped since. It seems like all hours of the day I hear stupid trucks beepin and boopin all over the place, hauling things from one end of the construction site to the other. The sound of the steel girders clanking in to each other is the worst part though. That awful boom of metal against metal. It became so consistent that I couldn't resist the urge to find out how much longer it was gonna take.  So last Monday I get to the office I work at and start asking around about this building that's going up. I started with **[61206c6f737420736f756c]** in the cubicle across from me. Oh yeah, it's going to be a hospital. Then I asked **[61206c6f737420736f756c]** three cubicles away. My brother and I were just talking about that yesterday. He's positive it's going to be a plastic manufacturing company but I heard it was going to be another Microsoft building. he said. I finished off my rounds with **[61206c6f737420736f756c]** on 5th that says it's going to be a law firm and the secretary on the main floor that heard on the news it was some up and coming web marketing agency. It was strange but I figured somebody was bound to say the same thing as someone else eventually and then maybe I'd have my answer.  I went over to my friend's place after work to play smash bros and we invited over a few more people to even the odds since he was way better than me (thank you internet for keeping me anonymous because I would never say that to his face). Once **[61206c6f737420736f756c]** and **[61206c6f737420736f756c]** got there, I started up again about the building. I was sure **[61206c6f737420736f756c]** knew because he was an editor for the local paper but even he told me that nobody he worked with could get a solid fact down. More than that, none of the journalists could even get ahold of anyone to ask about it's progress.  Flash forward to today; it all got so much weirder and became the major reason why I'm writing this in the first place. I didn't notice it until just a couple of days ago but they've started removing the steel girders and have instead started building up the main elevator shaft in the center of it all. Here's a picture I took yesterday: [tower photo 1](http://i.imgur.com/4yb0WxY.jpg)  You can see by the tilt of the rope in that photo that the girder is swinging away from the building. I'm not making this shit up! They're removing everything they worked on for the last year and have switched to working on the elevator only, like some kind of giant tower.  I was confused and a little freaked out when I realized what was happening so after taking the picture I went over there to ask questions but everyone spoke really broken English and every time I stopped someone they just yelled and kept walking. It made sense, I probably wasn't supposed to be walking around inside the gated area anyway. It was getting late and I was getting nowhere, but just as I was giving up and started heading back to my apartment, I noticed a single lone sign off to the left of the entrance that read **[5,433 Cubits and 2 Palms Tower]**. Now that I'd thought about it, this was the only sign in the entire construction site. There weren't even any labels on any tools or work trailers. The porta-potties didn't even have labels! Seriously, like every company gets their porta-potties from the same place so that didn't even seem possible. After looking more closely at the sign I noticed **[11:4-9]** was scribbled in red marker all across the bottom. I knew nobody affiliated with this construction could've wrote the bottom part because it was too rude (even for construction workers) to be on public display and actually made me a little uncomfortable to be standing so close to something so graphic. I left quickly after that.  Now I had a name but I needed to know more, I decided to go back that night after midnight. Here's a picture closer up from when I got there: [tower photo 2](http://i.imgur.com/y4FajHi.jpg)  I walked along the side of the wire fence until I came to the truck gate. I thought I'd have to hop it but it swung open with the slightest push. This was unreal, it shouldn't be this easy to get inside something like this at night. I kept going until I came to a decline in the dirt leading into a basement entrance to the building. Here's are some pictures of the basement entrance area: [tower photo 3](http://i.imgur.com/6favdIT.jpg)  [tower photo 4](http://i.imgur.com/JtZxYB0.jpg)  As you can see, there was a single light on in the back. I stopped abruptly when I noticed it but there shouldn't have been anybody at the construction site this late so I assumed somebody had just forgotten to turn the light off. I slowly started up again on my way down the path when suddenly I heard a box fall deep inside the building with an echo that I swear to god couldn't have been as big as it was. It sounded like it came out of a football stadium. No, that's not even big enough. It was like it bounced off the side of a mountain or deep within a canyon except it was inside! It sent a chill down my spine that forced me to turn back and just as I did, out of the corner of my eye I'm fucking sure I saw a huge beastly face that looked just like **[546865206f6e65207468617420736c656570732062656c6f77 ]** barely illuminated by the light of the room just behind it. From what I could tell in that instant, it was completely motionless. Just watching from afar.  I screamed and sprinted all the way from the basement entrance back to the front door of my apartment. I knew what I really saw had to be the silhouette of what was likely just boxes fueled by adrenaline and that effect being alone in the dark late at night has on you. I started to feel a little better from working that part out. Then just as easily as I got my pulse to slow it sped right back up as I remembered that something had to make that box fall and if it was a person, I'm sure they would've seen me and called after me to get off the property, right? So what the hell was it? What the hell is this building? I couldn't go to the police because they'd know I shouldn't have been there in the first place. I don't want to, but I need to go back tomorrow. I need to know who's building **[5,433 Cubits and 2 Palms Tower]** and why.  Somebody please look back at the pictures and tell me if you see the thing I described in the darkness. I doubt you can see anything because the photos are so dark but I'm too freaked out right now to verify anything myself. I plan to bring my laptop and a better camera with me tomorrow so hopefully I can update right on the spot.  -update-   I just added the events of part two [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2ebwaz/palms_tower_part_2/)
