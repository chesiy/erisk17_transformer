I only understood about half of what was going on in that.
Oh it's eats my soul up not having had a girlfriend, etc.  And I just read a post about how the guy was seen as a pariah until his "hot" girlfriend showed up to meet him for lunch.    That made me wonder if that's why people treat me oddly.  http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/392px2/its_kind_of_shitty_how_important_it_is_to_have_a/  That's the thread I was referring to.
More accurate perhaps, but not perfect.  It still doesn't cover things like stress, exercise, if you are sick, what you ate.  All things that have to be recorded and detailed by the people wearing them and a lot of that is perception based.  Then you have water intake......other conditions you may have, does the equipment interfere with things you may do regularly?   My thinking on it is, that it's so varied that we need genetic level testing and tracking so that medication/diet can be weighed against the genetics at play.    Won't happen due to cost, but that's my idea of perfect data.  It really goes down to figuring out what works for you and hoping your doctor isn't set in the mindset of "The guidelines say this, so we must do this"
What are you writing?
Sexy, cute, adorable.  First picture is probably my favorite.
Never got into a lot of detail with him.  But the way it was described made me think he was day trading to some extent.  I don't have any personal experience with it, but figured the OP might look into it since I'm sure someone on Reddit could advise if he has disposable income and a will.
Tri-state area is.......................where?
Bring out the wax and clamps, need to tame those sweater puppies.
History says this poster is a male.
Awesome as always.
*jaw drop*
If only cloning existed....
Sounds easy.  But it's not really something Im comfortable even attempting anymore TBH.  Might be the way the game is designed, but holy shit does all that false bravado and pretending and trying to carry conversations just get tiring.  Being the "I don't have anything better to do right now than talk to this person" guy.  Or the teehee, I need help with this and you're super interesting until I get what I need from you gambit some women play.  I personally don't see how some guys don't become bitter.  I don't rage-aholic asshole guy because of it like I see a lot of posts on reddit with the name-calling and shaming, but I can kind of understand the mentality behind it.  Since I'm way less tolerant of bullshit than I used to be, and it's definitely had a negative impact on my general outlook on life and the future.  And very few people want to be around a depressed/whatever person, so it only compounds IMO.  Shrug.  Guess I should just go ahead and say it.  After awhile suicide starts to seem like a pretty valid solution to the eternally-looking single life if you never get anywhere.
Hot.
I've never been married or had kids.  But the rest of the stuff I can relate to.  People can sense the depression/self hatred/negativity that comes along with it.  Havent spoken to many of my friends in years.  I've been seeing a therapist for...........4-5 months now.  And I don't think I started feeling better until I finally felt like I could tell them everything and that was a couple months in.  It's not even telling them everything, it's having them be able to communicate that they see that you feel stuck.  The first thing is that you have to take the view that as long as you are trying and putting all the effort you can into your job hunt, addressing your issues, etc......that you aren't a failure.  Failure is when you quit, and I myself quit many things because of the depression.  Sounds easy when you write it out, it's TREMENDOUSLY hard.    The therapist will probably tell you to keep a regular schedule, take a shower and change into clothes you would leave the house in...so you at least did that "normal" thing.  Eat regularly even if you aren't hungry.  Don't drink alcohol.  Take your medications, especially if you are on anti-depressants...but even your blood pressure/blood sugar can make your mood worse.  Also thyroid issues can cause depression, so if you have the potential for that you need to get it checked.   Personally I found talking to people to help, outside of therapy.  Lack of contact really makes you feel worthless on top of everything else.  Doesnt even necessarily have to be about the depression itself, just express the "loop"/"trap" you are in and see if they can see the best path forward or at least they say "Well you're doing everything you can, see your therapist, etc".  I personally don't think people can truly comprehend the self-hatred that comes with that deep depression unless they've had it.   And people pick up on it, I am 100% sure it bleeds through on job interviews especially if you really don't want that position as much as they'd like you to pretend you do.     So, I say therapy, express what you've said here.  Get a therapist you like, if you don't like the first one you meet go to another.  If you don't want to talk to a man about it, get a woman, old vs young, etc.  Apply to interviews and go, just try to picture the best possible outcome.  Try not to let the negativity toward your skillset/self take over.  Maybe even work on that first with your therapist since everyone needs money.  Another thing I've been told:  Sex, chocolate, sunlight, exercise, and regular sleep help depression.  So chocolate up your husband and go screw outside somewhere after a nap possibly. :)
Last two are good.
She has an amazing body.
Lovely.
When you think killing yourself will "teach them".
36 [M4F] Ohio/Wherever - Conversation, discussion, etc   So, I've sent a lot of PMs to women on here asking for friends, whatever.  Havent gotten any responses, and Im sure they've had a lot of applicants.  So will try putting up a post of my own to see what shakes out.  36 year old guy.  Depression, extreme loneliness.    Haven't had any "in person" female relationships in .....20 years or so.  So it's a confidence issue at this point.  I know I want one, but I'm an oddball apparently.  Read...mostly fantasy.  Dresden Files, Stormlight Archives, etc. TV...Supernatural, Workaholics, Tosh.0, many others. Movies...I'm behind on them. Video games...Guild Wars 2 mostly, but Borderlands and others...all PC.   Computer Science degree, but really haven't found that job that seems ideal.  Might be a case of location, might be something else really dont know.  All my friends are moving on to wives and children, and I'm left trying to figure out what to do with my time.  Overweight but working on it.  I feel like my life is more up in the air now than it was in college if that speaks to you.  Can discuss whatever, would prefer to stay away from politics and religion.  You being well spoken/written would be a plus.  Im a fan of bigger chested girls, long hair, nice smiles.  More into white girls than others, but I really don't want to limit myself in that regard as you just never know.  All I can do is try at this point I guess.  It's discouraging to say the very least.  PM me with a little about yourself and prove you read this.  I have skype and kik, but do not have video capabilities at the moment for skype video.  And really just want to text starting out to meet the personality first.
Exposure therapy.
I can relate, Im 36 years old.  Although I will add one big factor of it is feeling alone/lonely.  People really don't want to hear about your shit, or you perceive they don't want to hear about your shit.  If the off chance you do find someone to kind of unload on, and it feels better, they will start feeling the same way too and then either have to get away from you or end up like you.  Then you drop to an even lower level of "why the fuck bother"ness.  Told my parents about my feelings less than a handful of times and I could tell they didn't get it or thought even less of me for it.  So I don't do that anymore.  I really can't say that I believe my therapist understands that deep self loathing, apathy, and loneliness that comes along with everything else.    My best description of mine would be that the universe/fate/god/whatever will make anything I attempt to do fail or turn out worse for me.  As has historically been the case.  So why would I want to tempt that "force" and try to be "better" when I know Im just going to end up worse off.  I'm really tempted to put a "deadline" on my life, get fixed or get dead by age X.  I told myself for years and years I would die/kill myself by 35.  Here I am 36 and any little bit of happiness I have ends up leaving or being taken away.   The whole "behaviorism" aspect of psychology is ....... really the wrong way to approach people who have similar thinking to me.  Because I am an convinced that my behavior is in defense of my life being even worse and that's the only thing that can come of trying.  And behaviorism tries to teach you that your behavior is not working, so you should change type...basically.  It's just complete opposite IMO, you're basically trying to convince an atheist to become religious or vice versa with words.
Im not advocating piracy or anything by saying this, but I think there should be a caveat or......like a third bullet point to cover the instances where authors writing a series go waaaay off the path in the story line.    Im not going to name anyone specific or a series because I dont want to start that argument, but there is one specific series I have in mind where the series became more about the main character having sex than it did about story.  And that was.....half a dozen or more books into the series.  Now that may be covered under bullet 2, but I think it needs to be pointed out.  That a series should still fit within some semblance of the previous books or it's a fairly big slap in the face to the reader IMO.    Delays and things potentially can't be helped, but I just can't forget that WTF moment in that series when I was trying to figure out what percentage of the book was sex scenes and how many pages that left of actual story.
You are spectacular.  Glad you posted again just so I could see the history.......whew.
Spank bank material.
Yep.
Fresco, looks like a Fresco to me.
Alcohol affects your sleep, makes your apnea worse.  Chances are certain pain medications will do the same thing.  They say 15 pounds requires a re-titrate for your apnea....  But if you have apnea caused by your brain, unless the pain medicine is causing it as a side effect...I don't see you being able to stop using the machine.  Different masks can make a big difference, but you might also need to get another test if it's been awhile.  I know I had a thyroid condition and diabetes that got treated and it drastically changed my apnea pressure levels, and I felt like shit prior to getting everything addressed.  Might be something else happening.
While I don't care about H1Z1, since the announcement is mostly here......  I'd just like to point out that SOE announcements have a history of basically blowing smoke up your ass by using language that is very non-specific.  Current path of development and operation could be that they were PLANNING on more micro transactions and it was unannounced yet.  Get some hard promises out of them with specific language so it's not 6 months down the road and you're 100-200 dollars in when you find out they don't intend to honor what you THOUGHT they meant.   Planetside 2 has basically rotted on the vine versus what Smedley was spit balling the game could turn into.  It has lost so many players because of the lack of progress..... buying the same weapon half a dozen times is .......just silly.  And the whole MLG bend, waste of time as it just doesn't appeal to a mass audience.  They never added resource collection or anything that doesn't focus around the FPS aspect despite loads of comments on it, etc.  Planetside 1 last time I played had people obviously cheating, using vehicle immunity hacks or hacks to take the spread out of their weapon shots for pinpoint firing while holding down the trigger.  I'd bring up Everquest, but since it was new and people didn't know what they could expect...I can forgive some BSing there.  Then it continued with Everquest 2......all that voice work that no one wanted and a complete redesign of the Everquest world and classes that was like a game with Everquest name tacked onto it.  Landmark, while interesting for building, just lacks the basic "life"/spark of minecraft.  Haven't heard much of anything about Everquest Next in a long time....so you have no idea what they plan on doing with it.  Only person worse for bullshitting people is McQuaid.
While you have great tits, I think your hair and especially your lips are really quite spectacular.  For requests....I'd like to see you smile (show teeth)!  And a profile picture showing off booty and boobs.   Arms above head pic.  And on all fours pic.  Both showing off the lips and boobs.  Oh and nipple clips, if you're into that.
Love the boobs, and you're very pretty.
Have you tried sleeping without a pillow?  You might be holding your head differently because of the mask.  Ive found a lot of pillows to be rather uncomfortable with the masks and make me have to lay oddly causing neck pain, etc.  Also your mask shouldn't be too tight, they recommend allowing two fingers between the strap and face easily for "tightness" on most.  I know my back would hurt on CPAP because I wouldn't lay naturally with the mask on due to the tubing and everything else and being afraid of pulling the machine off the table for quite awhile.  The hose management thing took away the fear of pulling the machine off since it would have taken extreme force to do it.
