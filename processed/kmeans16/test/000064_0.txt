well, obviously
As a former muslim, I can confidently say that Islam is exactly like that.  There is a very popular hadith that pretty much itemizes how one gets into heaven.    First, you have to physically and outwardly be religious. If you can't accomplish that, you must at least be inwardly religious and god fearing. If you can't do that or are another religion, there's still hope!!  All you have to do is believe in the one-ness of god, regardless of what name you call him by. If you can't accomplish this, perhaps missionaries were unable to reach you with the holy message in time, then you can still get into heaven.  All you have to do is have an ounce of goodness in you. (pretty vague, right?)  So, not so unique, eh?
Sorry about that. I'm in the U.S., and honestly would look to move anywhere.  Third world countries are doable for me.  I'm interested in any kind of job, really.  I'm stuck in a dead end job at the moment, with absolutely no prospects of advancements, in one of the most expensive markets in the country.  I will not be able to save money if I live here long term.  My work experience is varied, but always with small business.  I started out with a small computer store, which did mainly tech support and custom machines.  I worked for a medical equipment company, and now am in the jewelry business.  Basically, everywhere I went, I helped the company grow by actively taking a management role with a lot of responsibilities under me.  I ended up leaving each company because they were family businesses.  The problem is, that this is all I know how to do now.  I have no corporate or government experience what so ever.  I speak English and Urdu fluently.  But I am only literate in English.  I would definitely be willing to learn a new language for the right opportunity.  Is age a factor?  34M
That's some fucked up shit.  You don't have to like a guy, but you have to be an absolute piece of shit to want to watch someone's career end due to a gruesome injury in the octagon.  Fuck yourself.
You have no idea what he's talking about because he's trying to use big words and getting them wrong.  Apprehending =/= comprehending.
Bollywood star Veena Malik handed 26 year sentence for 'blasphemous' wedding scene. "Veena Malik has expressed anger at a 26-year jail term handed down by a Pakistani court after she acted in a scene loosely based on the marriage of the prophet Muhammads daughter"
Chris Weidman's freakish reach   78"  I think this might be the factor that gives him his greatest advantage over his opponents in the middleweight division.  His reach measures a ridiculous 78", which a lot of heavyweights don't even have.  Similar to Jon Jones, he is extremely successful at using his freakish body to keep people away.  No one in the MW even comes close.  Hell, even Cain Velasquez only measures 77".  People clamoring on about how Machida, Mousassi, and Belfort will destroy this guy seem to forget what JJ did to two of those guys (And I'm a diehard Machida fanboy).  Will Weidman have the same success as JJ?  Who knows.  Jones' greatest asset is his intelligence in the cage and his ability to adapt to opponents mid fight.  Weidman seems to be able to do that so far.  His striking still looks weird and sloppy to me, but he's got a fantastic coach that is continuously refining that aspect of his game.  His wrestling prowess is already known.  The only unknown seems to be his submission game, and like Jones, we haven't seen him in a position to be submitted yet.  Am I talking out of my ass?  Who knows?  Probably.  But does anyone else think that his incredible genetics will keep him at the top for a while?  Why or why not?  If I'm making a stupid argument, please break it down and call me a noob or whatever.  But until someone convinces me otherwise, I'm hellbent on believing that his 78" arms are gonna hold on to that belt for a little bit.   I'm not saying that reach is everything, but Jones' dominance stems from his ability to use it effectively, and so far, Weidman seems to be learning from JJ's sucsess.  Anderson Silva's reach was also a ridiculous 77.6".   Cain Velasquez: 77"  Cigano: 77"  Travis Browne:  80"  Bigfoot:  82"  **Jon Jones: 84"**  Rashad:  75"  Phil Davis:  79"  Gus:  79"  Glover:  76"  **Weidman:  78"**  Machida:  74"  Belfort:  74"  Mousassi:  76"  Jacare:  74"
Ex-cop convicted of aggravated assault for putting a gun to the victim's head when he questioned the officer about entering his house without a warrant... cop escaped being convicted on a second-degree murder count for fatally shooting the unarmed man [X-post from r/bad_cop_no_donut]
Egypt's Christians face backlash for Morsi ouster: "there has been a string of attacks on Christians in provinces that are strongholds of hard-liners"
Question about USA's "Graceland"   Is this the USA network's attempt at a gritty corrupt cop drama like FK's "The Sheild?"  Because if it is, I don't think they will succeed.  If they want to stick to their USA formula for dramas like Burn Notice, and Cover Affairs, they'll be alright.  But trying to go gritty when you have no clue is just unwatchable television.  A lot like TNT's failed cop drama two years ago with Dylan McDermott called "Dark Blue" or "Deep Blue" or something like that.
I'll pose this question to the entire sub: If exMormons and exScientologists had a derogatory name for followers of their former cult, would that be as bad/worse/no different than "muzzie?"   THIS IS NOT A DEFENSE OF THE WORD MUZZIE.  I'm trying to get actual answers through discussion.  I don't want to turn this into ZI's defense testimony.  I don't want a referendum on political correctness.  I just want people's opinions on this specific question.  I've had this conversation with only one redditor so far, and we were able to keep it civilized, so hopefully the  same can be expected of everybody else.  edit:  please let's not turn this into an /r/atheism "socrates died for our memes" type issue.  I just want to know how people feel about this ONE question.
So, I'm gonna make a suggestion
Egyptian women fight back: AUC student takes sexual harasser to police:  "Sexual harassment, a modern social epidemic that hits two-thirds of Egyptian women daily, is lightly dealt with by police officers and has no conclusive definition in the Egyptian penal code"
I've been told that posting articles about Islamic related violence against women is offensive.   I haven't been contacted by mods or anything like that.  Just some political correct and oversensitive "just a few bad apples" religion defending types.  I do this to highlight the backwards culture that I was raised in.  As an exmuslim who's lived in Muslim countries, I have more experience with Islamic brutality and injustice towards women than most.  If political correctness demands that we never say anything negative about Islam, then I will stop posting here.
I've got a question about a BeachBody product.   It's called Les Mills Pump.  I know this is the P90X sub, but I see Insanity discussed here a lot, and didn't know who else would be knowledgeable enough to give insights.  My question is, for weight loss, is this as good as p90x?  The reason I ask is because I am very intimidated by p90x, and I believe that I must do another, less intense bootcamp before attempting p90x.  Especially because of the cardio and pull ups.  This Les Mills Pump workout seems to be all weigh lifting, all the time.  I know the guys at r/fitness would probably like it because they pretty much rail against cardio whenever they can, so I came to ask you guys.
This subreddit is starting to suck....   It used to be that in order to be best-of'd, someone would be providing some great insight into an unknown subject matter for a curious redditor, or some great act of kindness that went unnoticed.   Now, it just seems like every pun thread, or even slightly funny joke gets posted here, as if the OPs want credit for finding some hidden secret of reddit that no one else on the entire internet has seen.  But I guess such is the say of reddit.  After seeing the downfall of Insanity Wolf, r/WTF, and r/trees, we shouldn't expect anything less.
