What I haven't seen addressed yet is if someone starts something violent, you have no idea how far it's going to escalate. You don't know what they're packing. Therefore you need to either run away or incapacitate your assailant. That's self defense 101, you. I believe you should always try and run, but if someone starts attacking you and you can't easily get away you are completely justified in incapacitating them.
We have those everywhere around here. They are pretty and stay out if the way. I like to think they're a feature of the garden
Except the only reason the CSA flag exists is because of slavery. The confederacy only existed to holds on to the institution of slavery. It doesn't matter which southern glad you fly, they all advocate slavery.
I'll never make it big. Might as well never have fun with it either!
Humans aren't built to store massive quantities of fat. A normal sized person can survive a long time without food. Our bodies evolved to be lean functioning due to food scarcity
LOL
I had to scroll down quite a bit to find this comment, but that's the first thing I thought as well.
Yea. You just wake up later with hopefully no recollection of anything. Like 5 seconds after they start the drip you're gone

I mean she knows what she looks like, and gets paid for it. I don't feel bad.
The last one is a trigger. It took me a while to figure out what it is
Does he want the role? It's not just a one time thing. He would have to do a ton of press and sequels and appearances.
I couldn't stop thinking about how great Network is during this movie. This movie wanted to be a modern day network
Men invented logic right? Not that I believe that has anything to do with anything, it would just make get head spin if you told her
It's monster lady! You gotta appreciate someone this dedicated to being crazy.
Maybe they want to restructure as well and it would just be easier this way, or they just want a new identity for a new company

Set all the pet birds free   If you set all the pet birds free in America they couldn't all get picked off by predators. Then they might breed and we would have pretty parrots
Whats the beef between sun kil moon and the war on drugs?   Why did he make the war on drugs can suck my cock?
Tripping while depressed?   So I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety for two years now. I've also been on medication and attended therapy. I feel like I've made no progress. And I'm tired of it. Lately I've had the thought of taking shrooms or acid to see if that helps my depression. I've read lots of anecdotal trip reports where people claim if helped with theirs. I have experimented with psychedelics before, but never more than stupid swaying or mild visuals? Has anyone had the type of experience I'm looking for?
Failing another semester again   This is probably like the third semester I'm gonna fail. I just don't care about school. I know I need a degree for a good future or whatever but I just for want to do it. I'm totally happy just working. I love my job. I just can't do school right now. I've already told my mom I'm taking time off I'm just nervous to tell my dad. When I graduated high school I never thought this would happen. I've gone from an a student with scholarships to a college dropout and I don't care. I've been in meds for about a year but I've stopped going to therapy because I didn't feel that I needed it anymore. I'm happy but I hate school. I guess there's no point to this post I just wanted to talk to some people who have been through something similar maybe.
Found a seed in my recent purchase. Decided what the hell I'll put it in some dirt.
Does anyone recognize this cat?   I live in the mesquite ridge townhouses and I see this cat all the time. Super friendly but it has no tags. I was wondering if anyone knew anything about it. I can't afford to help it if its stray but it's such a nice cat
I downvote very twitter and facebook post I see on this subreddit.   I don't care what the stupid people you know think. This subreddit is for serious discussion and if you want to be taken seriously use serious sources. /rant
I have no idea why I like this subreddit   I don't know anything about cabling and I definitely dont understand what anyone is taking about. I just like looking at pictures of messy cables I guess. Anyone else like that on this sub?
Ever seen a Corgi-German Shepard mix?
