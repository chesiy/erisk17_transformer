Posted on your last AMA, hoping you catch it this time. Can you settle an argument between my friend and I? Do you consider the ending of Clerks 2 to be a happy ending, or do Dante and Randle realize that they regret the purchase of the quick stop?
If you don't have any objections, I'm using that for [/r/MercWithAMouth](/r/MercWithAMouth) first one anyone's suggested that i really like
HEY EVERYONE! OTHER PEOPLE HAVE HAD THIS SAME IDEA SO IT'S NO LONGER FUNNY! JOKES ARE ONLY FUNNY WHEN DONE ONE TIME AND ONE TIME ONLY! I'M DOING YOU ALL A FAVOR HERE BY POINTING OUT THAT THIS GUY IS DOING A JOKE THAT ISN"T COMPLETELY AND TOTALLY ORIGINAL.  Yes I know it's not been done before just once, it's done a lot but who gives a fuck. I still laughed. If you didn't ok, move on with your life and stop being a dick about it.
Thanks, I appreciate that.
Right now no, but we'll see where I end up.
Not exactly what it is, but this is a true statement.
That's what I was initially diagnosed with a year ago. At the time it was atypical because I could sleep and find some joy in day to day life. Less so now.
Ok, I think I see what you're saying. I'll definitely look into that. Thanks.
THERE WAS NO AARON
INCEPTION
You're absolutely right now that I'm rereading it. Either the psychologist told me the wrong thing or, more probably, I mixed up some of what he was telling me. Thank you for pointing that out, I'll get clarification on my next visit so I don't sound like an ass.
At the moment we're starting me off on prozac. We'll increase my dosage until I get to a point where it's not helping or I reach a degree of normalcy. The problem with Prozac is there can be side effects including the little general going permanently awol that may need to be taken care of with other meds, but we'll cross that bridge when we get there.  If I hit a wall with the Prozac, we'll look at moving me on to a more expensive cocktail of drugs but hopefully it won't come to that. Prozac is cheap and effective.
If you'll allow me (x-post)   You have no reason to care about me or my life and if you aren't in the mood for a long read, by all means skip this one because there won't be a tldr. Reddit, I don't get it. I suffer from depression, and have for a long long time, though it was only diagnosed a few months ago. But even with that knowledge, there's still so much I don't understand. A lot of my issues stem from lonlines, which I'm sure is shocking coming from a guy on the internet at 3am. However, I can't figure out what I'm missing. I'm relatively smart, have the ability to make people laugh, I'm overweight but haven't quite passed into ugly. What's the secret ingrediant to finding people that I missed? Did they teach it in school one day that I was sick. I'm not talking about a wife or my soul mate, that will come when it comes, I'm talking about a woman who can spend time with me and say you are worth spending more time with/on. Again I'm not asking for the rest of my life, but I see women all the time in these long term relationships with absolutely retched people, it makes me insane. It's a running joke with my friends that my life is a sitcom but it really is full of stereotypical bullshit that I just don't know how to get past or get around. Which leads to my other point. The loneliness is saddening and crushing and I don't know why. The fact of the matter is things happen at different times for different people and I know I'll find someone eventually, but it's been twenty two years and while I know that mentally, emotionally it's just like this gorge of sadness and desperation that I can't seem to cross. 22 years and not one girl has ever thought to say yes or ask me out on a date. I can't figure out how to get past this or why I need to. My time is coming, I know this. I'm smart, funny, cuteish, and can write fairly well, I know it will get there. But till then there's nights like tonight. Stumbling across pictures of the "almost had it" and just sliding down the walls, and I just don't know why. If you read this, thank you for your time, it means the world.
I want to start a conversation about the Penny Arcade controversy from the last month.   Please please please please keep this reasoned and cool headed. I just want an actual discussion and finding out what other people think about the dickwolves controversy from the last few months.  How I view things right now.  It was a joke. An off color joke that wasn't meant to offend but was inevitably going to. If you go back and read the original script, it was a commentary on "heroic" gaming culture and there is no conceivable way that it can be read as supporting rape.   That being said, they could have handled the fallout better. They shouldn't have apologize, nor should they have been asked to, and the follow up comic about the matter was perfect. However, pressing the issue just to press it with the t shirt and all of that was not necessary and shouldn't have been done.   When it comes down to it it was a joke, a joke I personally laughed at, and I have had rape touch my life in multiple incidents. If you were offended by it, then I'm sorry but sometimes people are going to make jokes that are going to offend you and that doesn't mean that they are advocating the position that did the offending.   For those saying this issue is done with, what spawned me writing this was going through the back catalog and researching their development for inspiration and I came across timelines and opinion pieces, it's very much not dead.  Just wanted some other people's thoughts and opinions on the issue.
