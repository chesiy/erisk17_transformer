I'm not a woman either so I thought I'd share my FU in this thread. At a festival, girl starts rubbing her ass against my dick, I apologised and walked away..
Well that's just like your opinion I guess.   If his story is true (which tbh is believable compared to other stories on the internet) then he got screwed over by bad/ negligent customer service and Gamestop should correct that.   But then again, that's just like my opinion I guess.
Muchas Gracias!!
The day someone actually makes a fully functional one of these things I'll be impressed, till then please don't waste our time and crush our hopes.
Willikers you're right!...Gosh darn it, can't believe I didn't know that.
This is just getting out of hand, and making jokes about it isn't going to help the situation. I'm not from America but it pains me to see that the "leading" country on this planet can't even get it's own police force under control. You're out waging war with half the world when you have fundamental problems in your own country that just get passed by and swept under the rug. Go to the streets get your voices heard, enough is enough.
I don't know how many people I'mg goin to reply to on this thread but it does work.   Source: I plugged in my N64 a few days ago. After 30 mins of inserting the cartridge with nothing happen I blew on it. worked instantly.
Not what you are asking but my most recent and surprising glitch was in Witcher 3. **SPOILERS AHEAD** It's when you are travelling through worlds with Avallach [Ciris elf friend, not sure how to pronounce his name] and come across the world with the deadly gas. If you manage to get down onto the lowest level [there are various ways of doing so] You can explore the world, there's nothing there but you can have a run around the ["titty mountains"](https://account.xbox.com/en-gb/screenshot/cd36820b-eed1-4b83-8067-3c73fe5d6465?gamertag=kiwi1990 scid=de360100-3ae5-4fd5-a7da-9d3d6b481c3d) as I like to call them.   nbsp;  Also my favourite was in World at War where you could go under the map on that tank map and kill everyone from below whilst guarding the glitch entrance with claymores etc.
Buy the time I have to buy my next console you would have spent the same amount on parts on your PC. PC gamers are constantly swapping out parts because the next game they play requires a better graphics card or more RAM etc etc. Don't get me wrong I have nothing against PC gaming, I just don't like it when people argue that it is cheaper than a console because at the end of the day it really isn't. You could future proff your PC at fit in top of the range parts and then yes it would last a very long time without needing an upgrade but for that price (around 1500-2000) you could buy the next 3-4 generations of consoles.
^N^^E^^^V^^^^E^^^^^R^^^^^^!
No but sometimes yes. You can play it without a problem but it does reference the history of the series a bit. Do as I did, play a bit and get a feel for what's going on in the current game and then go back and watch some youtube vids or read up a bit on it and you will get the full picture in no time.
Thanks man  that was a close one. We're even now.
The build up to the finale was pretty intense, the run through the sewers in particular had my heart racing. The climb up to the tower was also pretty good and tbh the QTE wouldn't have bothered me that much **if** it weren't the only bit of fighting in the finale. A nice trap room full of zombies that you had to clear to get to Raiz would've been a lot more entertaining and would've made the final QTE tolerable. I'm not not mad, I'm just slightly disappointed that there wasn't one last final "fuck yea moment" when you finish clearing the room of zombies and stop to admire your work.
"HA! remember that time I put your dick in my mouth and gave you a BJ. I got you soo good man!!"
I think people are just swapping the could and I. It's either "could I care less?" or "I couldn't care less". I prefer the first one as it's a bit more on your face because it's a question.
