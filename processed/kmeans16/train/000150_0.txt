AHHH! You're correct! I have forgotten the face of Oy and Jake too. Father Callahan would be disappointed as well if he did not unfortunately meet his end that fateful day at the Dixie Pig. (Spelling is key)
Balto?
I own one (Not the jacked one on a Chevy truck frame with a 350), in perfect condition. They rival the Prius without the douchebagery. Easy to work on yourself and extremely inexpensive. A header [(Which they sell)](http://www.pt2w.com/srd/index.php?main_page=product_info products_id=100 zenid=5cim64u09uuooi7j5vib2robj1), a K N air filter and an MSD ignition plus a few others, and you have a fine running machine. It's not as slow as you think at only 1,800 lbs with mods and 70-80 HP.
Family of Beavs, but a closet Duck fan. Shhh!
I work with some a-holes. But not all of us are bad. A lot of us are family men and pick our kids up from school and go to dinner with our spouses and are just normal folk. But I will agree, there are some grizzly old salts with more than a chip on their shoulder that give "the people in the warehouse" a certain image that might not be so desirable. And me personally don't think I deserve anything more than the next person.
I like the melted butter one.. "You would fat so!" Hey shut up!
You don't have enough upvotes for this. I was thinking the exact same thing.
Ha!

I have a female cat "Babs" I bought her a 30$ Cat Bed all plush, soft inviting and what not. She knows it's for her, she acknowledged it but sleeps not on it but in front of it... Cats are dicks but we love them. Why?
Thank you.
I have had A GEO Metro most of my driving life (Amongst other cars/trucks), And I will give a GEO Metro this... They may be a slow eyesore but hell, at least they're not a Prius! All gas and 40+ MPG!
It's nice to see the top comment be a happy ending and not a Joke or sexual innuendo such as "Now she has a fourth hole!" or something like that.
It wasn't the cake you pretentious tool! He rescued it from a factory farm so its all GMO'd up. It's probably more realistically some genetic disorder from all the Selective breeding. Kudos to you OP for saving the little gal.

Creepy yes. But I'm guessing rural area, deer bait, posed (Sweet ass creepy alien doll) and trail cam. I love this shiez! Upvote!
