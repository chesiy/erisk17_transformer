I'm saying the exact opposite.   You are actually saying this action is okay because it's no more rogue than previous President's actions.
Climate change!!!!!!
Yes, the USA supplied Free Syrian Army factions with Tow missiles to fight Syrian forces.  Yes, the FSA now has the name ISIS in Western media.  They are the same force.  'In February 2015, The Carter Center listed 23 groups within the Southern Front of the Free Syrian Army that have been documented using US supplied TOWs.[23]'  Source:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BGM-71_TOW#2011_Syrian_Civil_War  Videos of your tax money in use by ISIS:  http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=481_1413038085  http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=a1b_1433864733  Edit: Would love to hear the Obama followers explain how American TOWs w/  scratched off serial numbers made it to Syria.
More Than 347,000 Convicted Criminal Immigrants At Large In U.S.
This article was about people attacking Christians for simple holding signs.  Feel free to comment on the article.  I'll leave you with a quote re: leftist violence.  "I want you to argue with them and get in their faces" -Barack Obama  Not exactly the words of tolerance.
But just think of all the cultural enrichment they'll provide!
The vilification of wealth and success by the left is driving class warfare and America's suicidal push towards socialism.    Some people have far more money than you.  Get over it.   Life isn't fair and it never will be.
Why in God's name would this be down voted?  He is making a stand. Are the pro-Hillary algorithms in place already?
But...Bush!!  You do realize Obama has been President for 7 years?
The space to the right doesnt look like a spot, so he's not double-parked.  Also, he could be handicapped.  So what exactly did he do wrong?
Was it these guys?  http://theinstance.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SpiesLikeUs-Still4.jpg
Sure, Democrats save the crippled puppies and Republicans kick old people down a flight of stairs.  "Today's heresy is tomorrow's orthodoxy."  As half or /r/politics Redditors will be conservatives when you gain more life experience, this saying rings true.  Think about this whenever someone of conservative persuasion is shouted down, ridiculed and mocked on this sub.  Always question the mob.
Are our standards so low for black males that we elevate a man for simply opposing violence against police?  Why are we fawning over something that is simply what good citizens do?  Because he's black?  If he was white, would this be a thing?  All able-bodied men should be standing up to the criminals in Baltimore, Ferguson, etc.
Will the mayor continue to 'give space' to these criminals?
"Several press reports surfaced Thursday saying Clintons department signed off on the sale of uranium rights in the U.S. to a Russian company, while the Clinton Foundation was receiving donations from that company. President Bill Clinton was also given a $500,000 speaking fee in Russia."  Outright corruption to anyone with common sense.  Head-turning and excuses from the liberal Reddit intelligentsia.
Here is the Democrat playbook for scandals.  1. Deny, stonewall, deny, stonewall, etc. 2. When evidence finally surfaces in spite of Democrat obstruction, say "it happened a long time ago."  Sorry Obama, Hillary and Carney....the truth is timeless.
That's life. It's not fair.  When you stop blaming your problems on the "rich" bogeyman, you'll start sleeping better.  Take responsibility for your own situation.  No one else is holding you down.
It's hardly a kneejerk but is a stance founded in the principle of equal treatment of all.   You want to treat children differently because of their race.    You are telling them they need extra special treatment because of their inherent race.  I'm sure that does wonders for their self-esteem.  Affirmative Action tells people they can't do it without help and in America that's bullshit.
Again, anything to avoid considering the content of the posted article.
Iran now clear to build nuclear weapons.  Russia invading Ukraine and just boldly hacked into our systems yet again.  China will soon make an effort to retake Taiwan militarily.  Islamic extremism is growing unchecked and even condoned in areas of the Middle East.   But who cares?  Obama made sure his bracket it filled out and his talk show appearances and golf are on the schedule. He's a hip, non-white guy and we aren't racist and stuff.  Plus he like promises us free stuff from those evil rich people.  That's all that matters.
This is the product of liberal indoctrination in our public school system.  We freed 2/3rd of the world and 70 years later "we weren't much better."  Fuck off.
Contrary to what they would have you believe, the Democrat party is really a party of elitism.
It's ironic that someone with thousands of dollars of tattoos is flying across the world to threaten third world people that are driven to poaching simply to feed their families.
Obama saying something else is Bush's fault?  When will he start leading? He is one who **provided ISIS with TOW missiles**.  Also, is there any **single one thing** that Obama likes about America?  This man is not fit to lead a kindergarten teeball team.  He should be put in handcuffs and removed from office.
Anthropomorphic global warming is a farce and a political movement to undermine Western capitalist nations.  Devastating periods of climate activity are going to happen, with or without humans present. Consider the ice ages. Glaciers several kilometers thick formed and moved thousands of miles, crushing everything in their paths. There is no scientist on earth that can tell you why this occurred.  There were several interglacial periods of warming, where ice was rapidly melting.   We are probably in one of those periods now.     Even the founder of Greenpeace stated before Congress there is no scientific evidence of anthropomorphic global warming.     Relax, the sky's not falling. We don't need more govt control to avert another fake crisis. Sound familiar?
This person is celebrating attempted murder of police officers.  If you think this is cool or even acceptable you should probably move out of your mom's basement.
"Hiding profits in tax havens is one of the most common ways large corporations avoid paying their fair share to the IRS."  You know what's not fair?  Working hard to get somewhere and having to provide free housing, Obama phones, food stamps, disability, education and health care to people who sit around and smoke weed all day.  Most low to medium income people don't understand this because they pay little, none or even negative tax.  Rewarding the unsuccessful and punishing the successful is an unsustainable economic proposition.
More nonchalance from the Democrat semen chuggers of Reddit. Your nonstop excuses for Democrat lies and corruption will be a double edged sword.
The only thing wrong about this article is the number.  There are 20+ million illegals in the US. Since Obama's executive amnesty and his orders to cease deportations and even apprehensions, they are pouring in.    Third world status?  Yes we can!
100 inches of snow in Boston.  The most ice on the Great Lakes in recorded history.  Longest period without a hurricane hitting the US mainland in recorded history.  But: Up is down.  Down is up. Any dissent of newspeak will not be allowed. Forward, comrades!

I am Barack Hussein "I will stand with the Muslims...my Muslim faith...civilization's debt to Islam...Muslims have built the very fabric of our nation...the Muslim call to prayer is one of the prettiest sounds on Earth" Obama, and I approve this beheading.
