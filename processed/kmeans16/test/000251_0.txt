TIL A 900Kg manhole cover was potentially the first man made item in space, after a nuclear experiment blasted it going 66KM/s into the atmosphere. One scientist best described the manhole's speed- "going like a bat out of hell!." The manhole cover has not been found since.
Very muchly, I agree WLG were gimped from the start, but having spent a week there recently they aren't doing too badly with what they've got.  On the other hand, getting from Riccarton Avenue for instance to the carpark beside the bus Exchange, you have to go through about 5 set of lights, and cross at least 3 lanes of traffic (at a time.) which is nearly impossible for someone who doesn't 100% know where they're going. Which is stupid, road's should be intuititive and easy to use.
Ah, I recall that event.   I have to admit that it would 100% appear like the Herald are closing ranks around the reporter, as this piece of drivel posing as a 'apology' does not explain anything akin to what you've just explained. Thank you /r/Hubris2, fantastic ELI5.
No, she was a well spoken 24 year old woman. However she said the old guy just gave her an extremely bad vibe from the beginning.   To prove it really wasn't her -She sat it two weeks later and literally got 100% no shit.. Unfortunately this puts the pressure on me when I sit my Full! God knows I won't hear the end of it if I get anything less..
I agree they're not an immediate threat, but if they do that ten times, they grow complacent about driving on the wrong side and eventually make a mistake while doing so..    I have an example: the lady that hit me recently, when she turned into the lane furthest from hers without looking, "you're the first person in years to turn at the same time as me" was her excuse and she honestly blamed me for turning at the same time as her despite the fact it's the law to say I can do so..
I'm not comparing us to other countries, relatively speaking we have had it good. However recently (past few years) it's just gone downhill.    We've got as government that's spending ludicrous amounts of money on a flag referendum, which had no public support at all.  We've got a public service for unemployed that treat their customers like pieces if shit.   We've got children dying in public housing due to a complete lack of fucks at housing NZ.   We've got house prices going up $2000 a week and anecdotally a severe speculator and investor issue in regards to people inflating the prices of houses, which they profit from, ~~which then isn't taxed.~~ ^See ^below ^for ^correction  We've got the young walking out uni with stonking student loans and a government which isn't providing any incentives for companies to keep employing NZ staff.  We've got no government party with a meaningful action plan to address climate change.   We've got families living in garages still in chch thanks to being shafted by their insurance companies, and again a government that couldn't give a Fuck.    And we've got a government which refuses to recognize there's a massive fucking rental problem in the major centres and they have an over budget, under delivered housing scheme to supposedly address it.   And that's just what I could think of off the top of my head.  Pull your head from the sand, this country is being driven into the ground.
I'm running a g900i disabled most onboard apps like Google *everything* (movies, books etc), Samsung *everything*(movies books etc), and an running stock 2 degrees firmware from NZ.   I do use the dark theme for Reddit Sync, but most of my usage is browsing on opera browser beta.  Anyway, it can be done with little loss of functionality -no Google now or S-voice for instance.   And this was spent all day without power save mode too.   So yeah, ymmv but disable stuff if your Rom allows, you will be surprised what crap you run that you never use!
Battery tips and tricks you may want to know.   Hi /r/Android I know we're not a help centre, but there's a lot of battery misinformation out there, I thought a post which contains some good info might be good to clear the air, and feel free to add your own tips and tricks.  * You don't need to charge your shiny new device straight from the box. In fact every cellphone I've ever come across since 2010 comes precharged to around 60%.       [Source: Li-ion does not need to be fully charged, as is the case with lead acid, nor is it desirable to do so. In fact, it is better not to fully charge, because a high voltage stresses the battery](http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/charging_lithium_ion_batteries)  * Charging every night will not ruin your battery life. The key word here is **ruin**. Unable to find any conclusive proof however. Your battery will charge to 100% and then the charger will switch off, and your phone will discharge over many hours to a preset level before the charger will flick back on and take it back up to 100%. As the source indicates, these 'microcharges' can be performed thousands of times with negligible impact to the battery capacity.       [Source: See Table 2 which indicates charging 10% can be done thousands of times](http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_prolong_lithium_based_batteries)  * Extra reading: However as evidence has [found it is best to have your device off and remove it once charged.](http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/charging_lithium_ion_batteries)  * Charge your phone in Offline mode (or ultra-battery saving mode if you have it) will significantly speed up charge time. Really handy if you don't have a lot of time and just need a quick boost.       [Source](http://www.instructables.com/id/Will-An-iPhone-Charge-Faster-On-Airplane-Mode/)  * If you've forgotten your charger, but have your cable at a hotel chances are the TV will have a USB port you can use in a pinch. (Or if there are limited power outlets and you have multiple devices to charge at once)      [Source](http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2012/07/charge-your-usb-gadgets-through-the-tv-in-your-hotel-room-when-travelling/)  * Try to avoid excessive heat unnecessarily. For instance never leave your phone in the sun on your dashboard, or by a window. Batteries really don't like being hot for very long. Once or twice is ok, but don't go making a habit of it.       [Source: "Lithium-ion suffers from stress when exposed to heat.." Table3](http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_prolong_lithium_based_batteries)  * If your phone has a tendency to randomly shut down, there is a chance your battery contacts have become too bad and need to be scratched. I've seen cellphones that wouldn't charge or turn on at all come to life immediately after lightly scratching the contacts with a sharp pin or knife.      [Source: actually my own experiences working for 3 years in a consumer electronics store.]  * Modern smartphones feed usually as fast as the charger can give it. As a result if you're hunting for a charger look for a higher amperage.      [Source: "Increasing the charge current does not hasten the full-charge state by much...A high current charge will, however, quickly fill the battery to about 70 percent." ](http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/charging_lithium_ion_batteries)  That's all I can think of for now, there is a lot of misinformation out there and thought /r/Android could be a trustworthy place for others to be confident about their battery usage.
Fucking idiot. There's nothing else to say.
No tax bill in NZ. :)
Actually. Good point.
Thank you, that makes sense, as mentioned above I had 3 lemonade mixed with flavoured vodka, the end of each drink was significantly more bitter/tart tasting than the rest of the drink. So what you're saying makes sense.   Thank you kind redditor for your response, I'lll use a cosy next time to drink the drink cooler to avoid the bitterness!
Because (and yes, i'm going to shamelessly paraphrase you here.) Everyone wants to justify sinking a grand's worth of wages into their shiny new toy.   Judging by the comments on a lot of posts, we have an awful lot of HTC and LG phone owners who frequent /r/Android (Jesus, should have seen when the G3 was rated best phone by the MWC, the mods were cleaning the semen off the floor for days, it was a major circlejerk.) and when the competition does something better they naturally want to bag it to make themselves feel better. Human nature I suppose.
Let's be honest here, most people already have a perfectly functional device, it's the WOW factor that makes people crave the latest.  Makers are slowly realizing they need a "Buy This MotherFucking Phone, It Will Make All The Girls Panties Drop at the mere site of your awesomeness."  One needn't look any further than Samsung thinking they could get away with largely a "Me too" phone with their Samsung S5. Not even ~~waterproofing~~ water resistance or a dodgy heart rate monitor could help the fact that the phone largely feels like a S4 in your hand.   Potential owners need a flash factor, something that makes people go: "Wow, what's that phone?" It makes them feel good, and helps to avoid buyers regret.  However HTC have missed the boat entirely. If customers want a good HTC phone, they could very easily go with the M8 and not miss anything from the new version.  Put it this way:   Your contract is up, you walk into TMobile, and go excellent, I can get a new phone!  How a layman sees it while looking at what phone to buy:  **Screen:**  * M7: 4.7 FHD  * M8: 4.7 FHD  * M9: 4.7 FHD  **Design:**  * M7: Aluminum unibody  * M8: Aluminum unibody  * M9: Aluminum unibody  **Operating system:**  * M7: Lollipop  * M8: Lollipop  * M9: Lollipop  **Speakers:**  * M7: Front Stereo  * M8: Front Stereo  * M9: Front Stereo  **Camera:**   * M7: Takes photos  * M8: Takes photos  * M9: Takes photos  Why would you walk out of that store with a phone that looks and feels just like the 2 year old phone sitting next to it?..   Most people won't - they will turn to the Samsung for a larger screen, or Sony or Samsung for ~~waterproof~~ water resistance, or Huawei for a cheapie to tide them over.   There's just no justification why most people with last year (or the year before) should upgrade to this model.   Don't get me wrong, people will buy it, but there's zero WOW factor, and this will cost HTC sales to their competitors.
Thanks, I searched and something something similar. I'll ask /AskReddit/.
Thank you kindly good sir.  Edit: Actually it is a much better low-light camera than the standard App, (Samsung S4) as it focuses better, and with the HDR mode always on, offers an advantage over the HDR mode over the Stock S4 camera as HDR has to be selected everytime, through a rather clunky menu.   Very good, and hell, it's free so always a worth a shot!
