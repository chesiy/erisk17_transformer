I would totally be okay with 3 Tomb Raider universes:   - Hollywood Survival Action TR Reboot/Rise of  - Isometric Puzzle Platformer Co-Op Gaurdian of Light series  - Tomb Raider: Shadow of The Colossus edition  They are all pretty special, it would seem :)
Jeez you don't know the guy, don't you think it's over the top to throw names at people you don't know for, at absolute worst, not getting a game you were expecting?  You're never getting an apology or whatever you want from any human being if you start abusing them. No doubt gearbox had to endure this because of outrage then too. It's Human nature to not want to capitulate to abusive language - so it is counter productive.  Why cant we as a community talk civilly?
It's nice to see him being recognized en masse like this, he genuinely seemed like lovely guy and I think everyone can agree Nintendo's ability to have fun with itself and just enjoy entertaining others is an admirable trait. I'm so sad for his family, friends and coworkers, he has definitely left his mark on Nintendo. They will remember him well.  RIP
I'm more worried that the message, what Metal Gear says about war (i.e. criticizing it), will be ignored in any future non-Kojima MGS titles, turning it into a gung-ho military propaganda piece :/ .   Then again, I could be worrying pre-emptively, I'm sure there are other staff that "get" the series' core ideas
Finished MGS4 again just then... (Spoilers) holy shit...   Played Peace Walker before this second time playing MGS4...  Big Boss' death ;_; omg so damn fucking tragic.  All the regret and sorrow for what he did to the world, chained to the shackles of his ideals of "liberty". Giving Solid the true freedom to stop fighting and take peace.  Holy fuck, after Peace Walker too, when The Boss AI accepts peace and this angers Big Boss in that game, here you see him finally accept it.  Jesus christ, this is the same game where a weirdo soldier poops his butt for a whole act. Lol.  Seriously, fantastic ending.
1979 Revolution - Play a photojournalist during the Iranian revolution. Been x-posting this because it looks so different and interesting!
People equate honesty in disliking something with being agressive, I see that as a false equation. You can recommend against buying a game without dropping outrage that will inadvertedly spur on a huge audience to make this devs life miserable.   1 . Ending a review with "Unfortunately I didn't enjoy this game much, especially the character models, which needed more work to scare me. I hope the developer can learn from these points with future games. 1/10" is different from "Oh, and the scary little girl looks shit. 1/10"  They convey different attitudes to the audience.  2 . Jim is a top tier reviewer, there are games with bigger potential audiences that would probably appreciate a review from him more than a small indie dev who probably didnt' expect to get much attention at all. There are knock on effects to doing an anomalous review in this way.  It's a sledgehammer approach the gaming community often misapplies.

Haha, yeah fair call. Snake has a "naked" getup ever since MGS3 I believe, so maybe, here's hoping she's got some different getups like proper camo etc.
My biggest issue with Arkham Games is the redesign of Harley Quinn, It's not a game breaker for me, but I always loved Harlequin designed Harley. I don't feel she needs to be "attractive" in terms of sexuality. She's more of a goofball maniac after all.
Can't wait for this on PC, I think it's really cool how much they are changing up for fans as well as new console players.
Haha, wow, thanks I think!  :)
That is amazing!
This game sounds a lot more interesting than I initially assumed, the art style looks beautiful and the adventuring looks simple but fun! gonna have to try it out, nice!
Thanks everyone! I have added a revised art style at the top of the post :) lemme know what I can change :)
Why is Geralt more ruthless in The Last Wish (First Book)? (spoilers for the first short story)    He slaughters those guys in the bar and then uses that conspirator against King Foltest as bait for the striga. In the games Geralt seems like he has more of a warm heart, does his character change in the books, or have the games made Geralt more sympathetic? Don't get me wrong, the book is so far really awesome (got the audiobook), it's just interesting to compare and contrast.
