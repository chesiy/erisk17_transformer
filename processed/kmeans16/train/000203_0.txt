The quintuplet consists of a pair of closely linked stars - binaries - **one of which has a lone companion;** it is the first known system of its kind.  I think that is why it is different but I'm not a space scientist
I was paralytic once from something and a stranger was at the door, friend of house owner, owner says to me 'he's cool don't worry, talks shot but he is cool'  Guy sits next to me as I am flaked out of my gourd and starts tlaking utter shit about meeting mob guys when he was in New York  I am sitting there plastered like a fecal remnant on a dead and krusty porcelain remainder and scanning the wall looking for some escape  That paranoia... that paranoia  Eventually I concentrated hard enough that shit started to dance for me on the low shelf across the way. It was a shoelace. A shoelace saved me.  Then my friend says lets watch requiem for a dream.  Strange film to watch paralytic and paranoid with a fucking weirdo who won't shut up about his imaginings   Writing this is strange but this is all fucking true  True as st.peter

This happened to me before went I went in to see Casper but ended up in Scent of a Woman but it was okay as it was a country town cinema that only opened in the summer and they never had new movies just what the owner wanted to watch himself he apparently had loads of money so it didn't bother him that it closed in the end but while he ran it no one knew what movie would play at what time, you bought the ticket for the start time and people said he would laugh at the cries and screams from the audience as they were forced once again to watch Al Pacino dancing blind for the tenth time.

No the news was officially announced yesterday. I already pasted the passage and the link is in the article. This is a fact. This is undeniable and you are just being desperate now because someone called you out on not actually reading it. I posted it in comicbooks too.
That's, ugh, cool I guess.

Still the best thing I have seen on the internet.

Maps to the Stars was good. I ended up watching 3 films with the actress whose name I can't spell in a week or so. Stoker (5/10), The Double (3/10 mainly for the set design and lighting) and Maps (6.5/10 - the worst DC I have seen but still more interesting than most films, Julianne Moore is amazing in it)  Also saw Batman Vs. Robin and agree with below. Not the best of the recent movies but still good.
