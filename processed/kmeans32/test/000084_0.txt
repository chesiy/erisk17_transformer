Open-minded Hoosiers, Sunshower Country Club is having a clothing optional 5k on August 1st. Registration includes an all-day pass to the resort. Come have fun in the sun and run (or walk) in your bare buns!   [Race info](http://www.barebutts5k.com/race/bucket-list-race/)  [Sunshower's website](http://www.sunshower.com/)  Some commonly asked questions:  **Do I have to be naked?**  For the race, no. Clothing optional. I don't know about afterwards at the resort. Normally it's nude-only, but since the event is CO, they may make an exception at the resort (though definitely not in the pool). Call to verify.  **Why naked?**  Why not? Seriously,  attend any socially nude event, and within 5 minutes not only do you forget that everyone is naked (including yourself), but you also forget why you cared in the first place. You stop seeing "naked people" and you just see "people".  More to the point, it's incredibly freeing to be casually naked with others. There's no judgement, no shame, no staring, no prejudices, no barriers, and no pointless swimsuits.  You really have to try it to fully understand it, but once you do, you'll be hooked.  **What if I don't look good naked?**  One of the other things that becomes immediately apparent in a clothing optional environment is that nobody has a perfect body, and that's okay. You often hear people make remarks like "nudists are usually the people you don't want to see naked". That misses the point entirely (you don't go to *see* people naked, you go to *be* naked and to relax and have fun), but there is some truth in it in that many people attend clothing optional events/clubs because they want to learn to love (or at least stop hating) their bodies. Years, even decades, of body shame melt away almost immediately once you let go of the fear and shame embrace the idea that there's nothing wrong or embarrassing about your body.  Plus, everyone is naked, so nobody is going to judge, look down on, or gawk at you.  **Is this about sex?**  No. On the contrary, most nudist resorts (including this one) are family oriented, which means any overt sexual activity or sexual advances would result in the offender being immediately thrown out, and most likely arrested. A good rule to follow is if it would get you in trouble at a community pool or rec center, it will get you in trouble at a nudist resort (except taking your clothes off, of course).  Despite what society would have us believe, nudity is not inherently sexual (just as something sexual does not necessarily involve nudity). This is another one of those things that you just have to experience to fully believe, but within minutes the nudity becomes normalized and you quickly see there's nothing sexy about it. It's just people.  **What if I become aroused?**  You won't.  **But what if I do?**  You won't. Every guy worries about this their first time, but it's never an issue. The advice that always given is that if the wrong thought or breeze or whatever causes a situation, just go swim or lie belly-down on your towel for a minute, but I've never seen or heard of anyone actually having to do this.. Nudists are open-minded, accepting people (and they're all naked too), so if that were to happen, as long as you didn't provoke, flaunt, or maintain it, nobody is going to care (or probably even notice, people will be looking you in the eye, not the crotch).  Trust me, this is about as sexy as going to the doctor, you really won't have an issue.  **What if it's that time of the month?**  Nudist clubs always allow women to wear bottoms (even in the pool) if it's that time of the month. I don't see that listed on Sunshower's website, but it's almost certainly the case.  **What should I bring?**  A towel, which you'll use not only to dry off if you go swimming, but also to put down any time you want to sit down (no bare butts on chairs!). You'll also want plenty of sunscreen (I'd bring both a 30SPF and something lighter like an 8 to re-apply if you're not completely dry), and some money for food/drinks. You might also want to bring a book, frisbee, tennis racket (I see a court on the website, though it probably also doubles as a volleyball court), etc.. Other than that you just need an open mind and a smile!  **Other questions**  Feel free to ask.   Hope to see you there!

13 Emails That Stood Out From The Latest Clinton Document Dump
I think he's got a real chance, especially because cries like this have lessened dramatically. Just a few weeks ago you'd hear "He's amazing but he'll never win!" dozens of times per day. This is only the second time that I've heard it in probably over a week.  Overcoming that was a really major hurdle, and he got past it pretty quickly. He's flying up in the polls (they look better every day), he's getting insane turnouts at his rallies, he's raising good amounts of money (from people, not corporations or SuperPACs), and most importantly, he's clearly the best person for the job.  I think we're actually going to win this thing. And by "we" I mean America.
I'm down for everything except for the "instead" part. I like being able to see how long until the next one starts.  Other than that, I agree!
We've needed this for so long (even if it's as simple as [this](http://i.imgur.com/Y792nwi.jpg)), especially since we've got two ults to choose from, usually based on comp, not to mention the other talents.
Wait, so a Republican candidate is promising to stomp all over state's rights if he gets elected? Either I'm missing something here or he is a even bigger moron than I already thought he was.  What you're missing is that republicans are for states rights and smaller government only when it aligns with what they want. They have no problems with the government oppressing gay rights, waging a counterproductive war on drugs, subsidizing fossil fuels, etc..
Thanks. Of course.
Yeah. Every hero has a trait, which is usually (but not always) a passive ability that helps set them apart. Diablo's soulstones, Nova/Zeratul's cloaking, Kerrigan's shield generation, etc..  Tyrael does have one (I was just being bitter), his explodey angel death bomb, but it's both terrible and practically non-existent. Everyone is begging for Blizzard to replace it with something that actually affects the game, and that doesn't reward Tyrael for doing his job poorly.  As far as buying him, I highly recommend him, as he's both fun and power, though he is somewhat of a challenging hero to play effectively. Unlike Diablo, Muradin, ETC, etc., who can just jump in, push the enemy around, and take a beating, Tyrael requires a a good bit of judgement (plenty of pun intended) to know when to initiate and press an attack. And you really have to be diligent keeping an eye on your back line, since you don't really have a hard disengage.  That said, when you do get a feel for him, you can really punish the enemy for their greed and foolishness. Smart enemies learn very quickly if the Tyrael that they're facing is dangerous and treat him with respect. Weak enemies simply face justice and die.  And that's why I love him.
I still don't see what the benefits are of legalizing it other than some hypothetical talk about how much money it'll bring in from taxes.  It's far from hypothetical. Look how much Colorado has already brought in.  I don't want people getting stoned and then possibly getting behind the wheel or doing something that ends up hurting or killing someone else.  Here's the core thing to focus on: prohibition isn't prevent people from using pot. They already are. Tons and tons of them. Many kids choose weed over beer because it's a lot easier to get. The only things we're doing by making it illegal is giving up the opportunity to regulate it, and funding criminal enterprises.   If they go making it legal for cancer patients as a pain management drug, do they really believe those patients are going to be the only ones using it?  This is a particularly disturbing comment. If you'd let people suffer in an attempt to keep other people from using marijuana recreationally, I think you really need to re-examine your priorities.  Sure it might slow down the black market for pot  When is legal all across the country, there will be no black market. If you want proof, try and find a liquor bootlegger.  the bigger problem is what pot does to you when you smoke it.  Alcohol is far more harmful than pot. Do you support a return to alcohol prohibition as well?  TL;DR - Prohibition doesn't keep people from using marijuana, and it does far more damage than it prevents (if it prevents any at all).
It's up there with [this one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YkLPxQp_y0) as best one yet, in my opinion.
Three quick pointers:  1. Don't fight pointlessly, especially in the beginning. 2. Experience is extremely important, don't leave a lane empty unless there's a very good reason. 3. If your team is down a person, avoid a fight. If their team is down a person, pick a fight (or try for an objective/mercs).  Good luck and have fun!
That's where I'm at. I've never used marijuana, and don't intend to even after legalization, but legalization is very important, and if we can get this passed in 2016, it gets us most of what a good legalization bill would, and we can correct it from there.  I know people hate this proposal, and I'd rather see something better passed, too, but I'll take "mostly legal" over "pointlessly  and counter-productively illegal" if that's what we can get.
