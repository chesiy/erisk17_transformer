Wait she doesn't come out?! Well hell, I wish someone had told me that 47 minutes ago...
Woah, that's one of the creepier things I've seen on Reddit in a while.
I'm sorry, had to log on just to call complete bull shit on that. Your first time might have been awesome, but it *definitely* doesn't have to be anywhere near the best you can expect. I can clearly remember my first two times, and neither of them were anything special. In contrast to yours, it just goes to show that every time is different. There are a ton of factors that could go into why it wasn't the same, but you're tolerance probably isn't one of them. It may have gone up marginally since the first time, but not enough to make that big a difference.  I would recommend next time you do it in the early/middle day. That would leave you better rested and make it easier to resist the urge to go to sleep when it comes and go do something fun instead. fatmenareepiccooks was actually right though about indicas causing sleepiness in perticular, I would try a sativa if you could get your hands on it.  Every method is slightly different too. Somking, edibles, vaping, dabbing, etc. are all different in their own ways. Edibles tend to be more intense and longer lasting, I personally like them better, but you could easily have an equally good-even better-experience another way, say smoking. I would also try it with other people, that's usually more fun. Just do your own thing though and don't take any thing anyone says too seriously (including me). In the end everyone is different, so go try everything out by yourself and don't be deterred or motivated based off of what people say on the internet. Good luck!
I'm not exactly sure what you mean I guess. What is the difference between dying and ceasing to exist? I don't think it matters though, you certainly wouldn't live through it. A big black hole would pull you apart just as much as a small one. If anything it would even do it faster with its extra gravity. No one knows what would happen at the singularity, but you would probably be broken down into pieces so infinitely small that we couldn't even come up with a measurement for them.  I haven't read the article you're referring to though, I could be completely 100% wrong.
In a totally serious way, Paul Blart... It gets so much shit but I really did like that movie. No one wants to see the second with me and it's been killing me. I might just break down and see it alone.  Also any movie that is the 4th in a series. On Stranger Tides, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, you name it. Sure they aren't nearly as good as the first few, but the nostalgia, the characters, the awesomeness, it's usually enough to make a pretty damn good movie, even if it doesn't compare to the others. Any movie with Jack Sparrow or Indiana Jones is awesome in my book, no matter how shitty the story line.

Who is yor favorite rapper, and why do you say Snoop Lion?  Ug, butchered the delivery.
How does one exactly laugh at something while not paying attention to it? Do you even think before you type? You got that one lonely brain cell left, use it.  While under normal circumstances it's easy to understand the difference between insults and jokes, yours seem to be the solitary acceptation. I'll tell you what, how about you actually make your jokes *funny* and your insults *offensive*. That way not only will I understand them, but maybe we could even consider what your saying 'coherent'. This might seem like a lot to take in for a person like you, but one step at a time, bud.
There was a kid who would just say some ridiculous shit to this one teacher because he knew he could get away with it and just wanted to see how far it would go. He said things like, "On Christmas Eve, I'm sneaking into you children's bedrooms (she had two infant girls) and painting myself green so I can and hold them as ornaments instead of your Christmas tree" and "In the middle of the night I'm going to climb into your husband, so that when he talks you'll hear *my voice*" (he put some great emphasis on that last part), and even "I went online to 'rentaslave.com' and ordered you a nice new pair. Oh, happy Martin Luther King Day, by the way". Just some weird fucked up shit. The most shocking part though, was her reaction. She never did anything about it. Just laughed politely and said things like, "Alright, now I think that's enough now, John" all the while still smiling courteously like he had just made some chuckle-worthy light hearted jab.
Pass the text book so we can puff up this-no I can't fix this, he's just a complete and utter stoner.
Uh oh
This would give me the same exact dilemma as my neighbors drive way. I know, let me explain. You see, they have no ordinary drive way, no sir. Its made up of individual stones meticulously fit together without cement like some sort of road mosaic. It looks incredible. Every time I see it I'm like, "Damn, I couldn't drive over a piece of art like that!". Same concept with the ashtray. Good job, OP!

Please repot back after you ask, I think we would all like to know.
Phew, glad that's cleared up. The way you worded that kinda made me think you were shitting your pants on the regular and that your 'wife' was a guy.  EDIT: 'Phew'
