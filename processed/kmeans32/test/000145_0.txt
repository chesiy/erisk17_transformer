Wat.
It has been for a loooong time. I'm always checking back for goodies.
Thank you very much for your insight and kind words. I wouldn't deny the fact that abnormal myelination could be a hard thing to see outside a trained eye. Maybe I've watched too many episodes of house, and have always pictured a diagnosis like this to be broken down in a very basic visual presentation. I just want to see it for myself, and have explained to me what I'm seeing. I'd love nothing more than to compare my son's MRI with a "healthy" one.  We already have an appointment with another neurologist, and as he's a colleague of our current doctor I'm hoping for an unbiased assessment. Only time will tell at this point. Thanks again.
I'm not sure they have a website, it's really just a butcher on a farm North of the city. They offer just about anything you can think of. They have all sorts of game meat (elk, bison, deer etc), and of course chicken, pig, and beef. A big juicy New York Striploin is about 10 dollars, and personally for me, the best thing I've ever eaten.   I stock up on all my meats there, hamburger, whole chickens, bone-in hams, steaks, bacon, and sausages to name a few. It's worth seeking out and having a look for yourself.  (FYI - you have to call in and pre-order bone-in hams this time of year)
Hey thanks! I'll give it a shot.
You're in the right sub if it's dreams of coolness you're after.
Two skin cracks in close proximity to one another on the side of the fuselage directly below the cabin windows. Both were removed, and the applicable repair was carried out. A "quadrupler" scab patch is 4 layers of treated, primed aluminum, of various thicknesses that are fit, drilled, and installed in accordance with the structural repair manual.
Trunk nebula gif is nuuuuuuts.
Agreed.
I remember the controversy that surrounded the band in the media due to their electronic style shift, I was very intrigued.   I received the album from my brother as a gift on my 18th birthday. The night I got it in the mail I had plans to hike to my friends cabin, as we usually did with whatever free time we had. I didn't go anywhere without my discman and a few albums. Of course I brought this one along with me and played it on a continuous loop for the entire trip. It was how our hikes usually were, especially during the cold winter nights when there wasn't much point in talking over the wind, better off keeping your head down and conserving energy.  This story is becoming more of a nostalgia trip for me than anything else, I apologize. Anyways, I'll never forget the moment we got off the main road and headed into the thick bush during the pitch black of the night, and snow falling like crazy. I fire up track one, everything in its right place, and it ended up being one of the most memorable music moments I have, and it sticks with me more than any concert I have ever been to. I instantly fell in love with Kid A, and listened to it on repeat for weeks, if not months.   I'm not sure if it was the pitch black forest, trudging through powdered snow that was still falling through the beam of my flashlight that made the moment so goddamn perfect for that album, or if it was the album that made that moment so goddamn perfect. Whatever it was, it is and probably always will be my favorite Radiohead album.  Good times.  EDIT: I don't think this qualifies me as "old", but I remember it clearly so I thought I'd chime in. Or maybe that's me denying the fact I'm quickly getting old.
I would enjoy this.
I've brought it up with the board, and they will "look into it". Another issue I have with this is, this is our shared visitors lot with "NO OVERNIGHT PARKING". Not sure if you can see it on the sign or not but yeah. The absolute gull of some people. The only time it really becomes an inconvenience is the weekends when parking is scarce, so I try my hardest to look the other way throughout the week, but find it really hard as I pass by him everyday. Thanks for the idea.
Newbie to the audiophile world. Looking to invest in a turntable setup, and was wondering if my current [Onkyo TX-NR609](http://www.eu.onkyo.com/en/products/tx-nr609-35517.html) receiver would be sufficient. Not only am I very happy with its sound (I play 320 kbps MP3's through a PS3) but I am restricted for space in my man cave, investing in a separate receiver would be a challenge.   What would be a decent beginner turntable setup, and how could I operate it through my current receiver? I'd like to keep my budget around the $500 CAD mark, but as always, am willing to weigh my options.  Thanks.
I really liked the live suggestion made by /u/sowr in my original post. The idea that their performance art currently best represents the band really stuck with me. It's a theme of its own when you think about it, a theme which is most relevant.   Again I will reiterate that I am no photoshop expert, and there are probably many around here better suited for the task. I would just really like to see a change from what we currently have.  EDIT: TL;DR The live tool experience best represents the band in my opinion.
That's because us fliers are simply cash cows, so fuck us.
Yeah me too.

Haha, I've been there. It's funny to be a dick, even if no one else thinks so.
Haha.
Awesome, glad to hear that. Let me know what you think.
Please take my opinion lightly, but I've read your post and all the comments in it. It seems to me most of you are taking it all way too seriously, who gives a fuck? You're not going to change how other people perceive or feel about it, so why even bother. I'm with you on the matter but it's pointless to bring it up. Some people like things in a way that you don't, good lord better point it out, that'll teach them. Singling out the downfalls of others is pretty sophomoric in itself, why not make a post expressing your "insight" in a more constructive way? Why not tell us how Tool's music has affected you, changed you, or got you through a hard time, effectively removing the spot light from the "idols"? As for the comment here literally over analyzing the shit out of the whole thing, I've never read a more desperate attempt at trying to have Maynard personally login and and agree. Jesus H Christ people, it's music, of course the contributing artists will get credit equal to the greatness of the art. It's the exact same reason why many humans throughout history have become house hold names.
Thank you.
First post to /r/Aviation, thought I'd share our group shot from our 50th delivery of the Twin Otter 400 series celebration. We've come a long way, and we're all proud.
NOoooooooooooOOOoooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!
Unfortunately I cannot shed light on the quality, as I've only just begun collecting my favourite albums on vinyl and have not yet invested in a setup. This of course is something I want to do right and make sure I am financially prepared so it'll be a ways away. All I can tell you is Diamond Eyes is on white vinyl and that it was indeed the 85 dollar bundle (95 Canadian for myself).  EDIT: I believe they are all 180 gram.
Who would like to see Tool collaborate with Cam de Leon again for the "new album" artwork?   I'm a fan of Alex Grey's work, don't get me wrong, but I just really love Aenima's style the most. I'd love to see it happen, although yes I know it's highly unlikely. Thoughts?
Preventing my 17 month old son from hitting, grabbing, and pulling hair.   Hello /r/parenting, I'm so glad I found you this past week. I can tell I have much to learn from you guys and I look forward to growing with you. Having said that, I am new to fatherhood with my 17 month old son, and his soon to be born baby sister. So far I am having a blast, with all the ups and downs, all I know is I wouldn't change it for the world and that this has been the best experience of my life so far.  The reason I come to you guys with this post is that currently my son has started to hit really hard, he has always had a thing for pulling my wife's hair, but now he's doing both to us. I really don't know how to react when he does this, should I be firm and tell him no? Or should we try not to draw any attention to it. So far I've been doing my best to make him understand that it hurts and that he shouldn't do it, but it's seemingly having no effect.  I'd really like to know how to deal with this especially before our little girl enters the situation and becomes another victim. Thank you so much for any help you can offer.
I had the same problem with the xbone, so I ordered it from future shop's website with free shipping. Showed up at my door in 1.5 days VIA Canada post. Not sure if it would be similar for the PS4, but it's worth a shot.
Although his/her answer was thorough and awesome, s/he did allude to Calgary being more of a white collar town, which is really not the case. Maybe on the surface it would appear that way, but there are many trades for one to get into. Even with only a high school diploma, you could definitely get your foot in the door as a pipe fitter and make a great living in a few years. Do you know people in either town or surrounding areas? That would be the biggest deciding factor for me.
This picture actually made me laugh, thanks for that. I found your dog reminded me of [this guy](http://m.imgur.com/ME0q6h3).   You should post him to /r/photoshopbattles.
I know a guy who would kill for a floor seat in Calgary. I live here so if you had one I'd meet you.  EDIT: realized how insane that comment sounded after I wrote it. Seriously, my buddy has never seen them, and missed out on the floor ticket sales.
This guy broke into my elderly mothers house and stole all of her sentimental jewelry that was basically worth nothing. She'll never get it back.   I have zero Photoshop capabilities, so I thought I would reach out to the Reddit community for some help to make these pictures a little more hilarious than they already are. I know they are kind of blurry, sorry about that.  [Picture #1](http://i.imgur.com/kdyaX.jpg) [Picture #2](http://i.imgur.com/xAPMb.jpg)  Any help would be greatly appreciated!
