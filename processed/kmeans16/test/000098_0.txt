When I Was Four...   I grew up in the middle of nowhere. Nowhere as in nothing but woods and dirt roads for miles. The closest store is a gas station a mile away, and all your neighbors, sparse as they are, tend to keep to themselves. My dad worked freelance construction and my mom worked with MRIs at the closest hospital (which was about an hour drive from home). He got a deal with our one 'next door' neighbor. He bought a 200 year old barn from him and using his construction skills, completely renovated it into a house. It wasn't by any means the best locale for their areas of work, but it was a home, and it was ours. Seeing that my parents both worked far from home on a pretty regular basis, I was always stuck with a babysitter. Most of the time it was my grandma, who I call Nana, but this particular week I was being watched by my grandfather.  Now, before I go any further let me say this. My grandfather was a good person in general, but growing up and learning later, he was very abusive to my dad and his two brothers, as well as Dad's mom. My dad was against me staying with my grandfather, and for good reason, but Nana was busy that day and there was no one else who really could on short notice. He was staying at my Aunt Marilou's house (whom I've never met, she died before my mom was even born). This house has been abandoned for years, and was about as old as the barn my dad had converted for us to live in. It has stayed in the family, and since it was only a half mile from our house, my dad kept up the maintenance. My grandpa didn't have a place to stay, so dad offered him the house for the week he was visiting from Tybee Island (GA).   Mom dropped me off at the house with him around 4am. Being a little kid, the only thing on my mind at that time of morning was to go right back to sleep. I woke up sometime around 5 or 6am to a thud. I looked around and didn't see my grandpa so I tossed the blankets over my head and tried to go back to sleep. I heard a muffled sound that shot my eyes wide open. It sounded like talking.  "Grandpa? Grandpa where are you?" I asked. I didn't get an answer so I sat up and decided to go look for him. From where I was in the bedroom, I could walk either into the living room or the dining room. I decided to check the living room first. Now, knowing the cliche' of all old houses having rickety wood floors and creepy paintings on the wall, this house fit it to a perfect capital 'T'. I hated walking through the living room, more because it was a long rectangular shape, more like a long widened hallway and less like a room. I always felt like the pictures on the wall were watching me everywhere I went. As I passed by the piano, I thought I heard a few notes play. Being a somewhat rational little girl I told myself I was just hearing things and continued to the door closest to the front door, which was the other bedroom. The muffled talking sound seemed like it was everywhere now. I didn't know who or what was there, but I was really on edge at this point. I shoved open the door to the other bedroom. Silence. It was so sudden my ears started ringing. I looked around only to find an empty bedroom with the covers still made. I closed the door and walked past the piano again, to the other room on this side of the house. I had never been or even seen inside this room, even to this day. As far as I have been told, it was only used for storage, and mainly for more creepy 'look at you everywhere you go' paintings. No shock, this door refused to open. After a couple of minutes of trying, I gave up. He wasn't going to be in that room. I wandered through the dining room and into the kitchen. No grandpa. Why was I not surprised? What I did find, however, was quite an oddity.   The old 60's style fridge was there with the door wide open. In the light cast from the fridge I could see all the chairs around the kitchen table were slid out, as if awaiting a crowd to sit down. I closed the fridge and put all the chairs back in place. Now this is where it gets really weird. I decided to go lay back down since I had no idea where my grandpa went.   I woke up again to the sound of muffled talking. I opened my eyes to see four white figures standing over me. Three of them were men and one was a woman. I can't remember the details of their faces, but it was scary enough as it was. I threw the covers back over my head and screamed for my grandpa. The talking stopped and I didn't see any glow through the covers anymore. I carefully eased the blankets from my face. Everything looked as normal as can be. I was still a little shaken, but I knew my grandpa had to be somewhere on the property because he was an adult. No adult in their right mind would leave a kid right? I decided to grab something to drink from the kitchen before I took a stroll outside to see where he'd gotten off to. I guess by this time it was somewhere between 7 or 8am.   As I walked into the kitchen, I began to get a sense of deja vu. The fridge was open, yet AGAIN and the chairs were slid out around the table still waiting for someone to sit down. I just shook my head and chalked it up to me dreaming that I put everything away, and did so again. I took one chair and slid it to the counter so I could reach the cabinet for the cups. I grabbed a glass and sat on the counter to drink some water straight from the faucet. I sat it down on the counter and climbed down, sliding the chair back where it was meant to go. I heard a grinding sound behind me. I turned to see my glass had slid about 4 inches from where I had sat it before I climbed down. This spooked me about as bad as the figures I saw so I decided to quickly make my way outside. Just as I was heading out of the kitchen, I felt a splash all over my face and right shoulder as I heard the sound of glass shattering. I glanced down just long enough to see the bottom half of the glass rocking back and forth on its side.   Needless to say, I booked it out of there. I ran right out the side door (which was in the bedroom I was using) and across the yard to the dirt road. I ran as long as I could, and walked the rest of the way back to my house. I have no idea how long that actually took. I remember vaguely stumbling up the cement steps onto the porch and banging on the door until my dad opened it.   "What's a matter? Where's your grandpa?" He picked me up and brought me inside. All I could manage to say to him was "I couldn't find grandpa and I got scared." He called in to work to tell them he couldn't find a babysitter and stayed home with me all day. When mom got home he explained to her what happened (about me running home by myself) and decided to leave to go find my grandpa. They were both furious. Where was my grandfather? He decided to drive up to the store to buy beer as soon as they opened since I was still asleep. He got into a long conversation with some of the locals and lost track of time. From that point on, I refused to go there without either of my parents. If it was still standing today I'm not even sure I'd step foot inside.
ahhh you've got me hooked! I'm so ready to find out what happens!
sounds like you smoked a bad batch, my friend. Sober up for about a month and see how that goes
Umbrella corps at it again!
oh god, I HATE clowns. At least you 'got it' OP! I would probably do the same to any clown that chased me tbh. Those things are so freaky!
Sorry you had to go through that OP! I'm glad he got what he deserved though. Am I the only one that had "Bartender" start playing in their head when they read the first few lines of the last paragraph? Just seemed fitting somehow
I'd definitely put as much space between it and you as possible. Who knows what they were planning down there!
aw, man! That reminds me of some Stephen King mess. Glad you're ok OP! At least they wont be hurting any more people!
I used to love my old job
Thank you for posting this OP! I thought I was the only one who believed all the 'gods' are one being that has been interpreted differently by different cultures. I also agree with the thought of moving to another dimension in energy form. Wasn't it Einstein that said energy cannot be created or destroyed, it only changes form? This has made my day :)
two words... don't blink! seriously creepy though!
It sounds like a possession and exorcism
two words: restraining order. Tell the cops she has threatened you and your family. You may not have to even go into details, especially if you tell them you're scared for the lives of your loved ones. I'd definitely tell the cops about the note being in the house!
It sounds like you guys may have an entity in your house. It can be attached to the house, land, or one of you. I agree with alot of the other posters about trying a night or two away from home. If it follows you, then its not the house. Might I suggest those shake-battery flashlights. If power fails, kinetic energy will likely prevail at least. Here's a question for Shauna: Have you ever dabbled in the supernatural? Playing with Ouija boards or trying to talk to spirits in graveyards, or the like? Sometimes it can cause something to pay attention to you. I know OP said he had toyed with one before. They have been known to bring about bad entities, and it may not show itself right away either. Sorry if it doesnt ease your worries any, but I'm trying to throw up any possibilites at this point.
I thought that possibly too, but if OP's baby was screaming because of the entity, then I don't think I'd rule it a nice one.
It's always interesting to meet a fellow empath. I've been sensitive to pretty much all energies. I know it can get overwhelming too, so let me be the first to say I believe you! I've dealt with several supernatural entities over the years, and I really do think they mess with us just because we can notice them easier than other people. It's scary to know something's in your house that can move things and touch you, especially when you may be the only one who notices. I hope the entities you've encountered haven't been too oppressive over the years, they can really drain you.
