"Steven Super California Fragile Lipstick Tree Fiddy Stars and Stripes Loch Ness $5 Wendy's Burger".      If you don't say the whole thing I'm not leaving the Oval Office.
I respect your opinion and do agree that it is a great weapon, but compared to what it used to be I just can't use it in the same way.
That's a garbage weapon that could have been so good but it sucks. *insert lenny here*
You mean the Original or the Stock?
Sniper can do his job better, Demo can do Snipers job + Demo's job of the tank. Soldier needs the Buff Banner to give extra damage for the team. Engineers goal is make sure his buildings stay up and bait sentry busters.      The meta is the best way to play because it is the fastest and easiest way to play for the most part of the game. I said it before and I'll say it again, The gamemode and the meta are like 2 years old I shouldn't need to explain this. Look at Google.
Psst, hey it's me, MrLoak, I'm the second coolest in the chat! (Coolest of course being BasedViva)
The 'Whatever Kills You Makes You Stronger' Challenge   Very simple premise, start with whatever you want, but the moment you get killed you must switch to that class and only use the weapon that killed you.   Did you just get killed by the Eyelander? You Now are forced into the Eyelander until you die, at which point you switch to whatever killed you.      You are allowed to use items that aren't in the same equip slot, for example the Tide Turner/Wee Booties or a Soldier backpack.      Have fun letting Rockets kill you so you can use rockets.      Also you should use the Auto Buy thing from scrap.tf before you do this, just to make sure you can use all the items you need.

At first glance this looks like me bragging about my "wealth", but this is actually all fake, using the console command "itemtest" allows you to equip and paint items with the unusual effect of your choice! (Disclaimer, you won't really own these.)
Spy is a soft counter to everything in this game, his sappers only break your guns if you're not near them or if you're dead. If you're dead then Soldiers and Demos can take it out anyway, and they can kill you easier than a Spy.      I'm speaking from past experience by the way. I've hardly ever had trouble from spies.
You can survive three without an overheal. I do it all the time.
They are way way better, which is why I don't understand the dude calling it broken, I might add that I was on Granary Mid, a small map where you can't hide and regen.
Fool I wasn't talking to you, I was talking to the person being all high and mighty, I also looked at their post history, [The first post they have on /r/TheButton was 10 days ago] (http://i.imgur.com/4YsbR29.png) which shows that they most likely did not arrive on day one.
I hide mine because I am an enigma, wrapped in a mystery, I will tell anyone who asks that I did infact press the button, anybody who wants to know can know that I pressed at 60, and that doesn't make me dirty, that makes me early, I've likely been here longer than you have you dirty grey.
