I didn't say they are all victims of child abuse, I'm sure many are not, but its clear to see there are lots of people there who are. The whole 'Nmom' or 'Ndad' thing is used in all kinds of psych forums and support groups to highlight the abuser, I just found it strange you felt compelled to say you found that to be 'crap'. They need help and support not a slap in the face.

fulfill  to realize, perform or do, as duty; obey or follow, as commands
"Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets.  I have come not to abolish but to fulfill them.  Amen, I say to you, **until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest part or the smallest part of a letter will pass from the law, until all things have taken place**."   Jesus breaking old testament laws while he claims to be here to fulfill them is just another case of the bible's contradictions. That's pretty amazing mental gymnastics to spin that as a good thing for Christianity!
How about Ericsson, HM, Skype, Spotify, Soundcloud, TicTail, Electrolux (the worlds second largest home appliances manufacturer), AstraZeneca..? on top of your IKEA and Volvo. When you take population size into account Stockholm is one of the most entrepreneurial cities on the planet. The rich are taxed highly, but still have luxury lifestyles and the highest standard of living in the world, and the money is spent responsibly to help the poor and unconnected become successful too instead of leaving them out in the cold.
Nope. Carlin is right. IQ tests use 100 as the *median* score. Half are above, half are below.
A leaked report regarding Park View school has been [obtained by the BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-27757987)    This highly-critical report found a classroom culture in which Park View School was not welcoming to non-Muslim pupils. It described a "madrassa curriculum" in PHSE (personal, social, health and economic) lessons and "posters written in Quranic Arabic in most of the classrooms visited"... and there were claims of an inappropriate external speaker being brought it to talk to pupils.  If you Google it there are plenty of pictures of the classrooms on the school's website too.
The vast majority of schools in the UK, regardless of if they are fee paying, have uniforms. The schools involved are all non fee paying, taxpayer funded. Blazers (in the summer) and headscarves are not a compulsory part of the uniform for obvious reasons but the few little girls who didn't totally cover themselves were openly referred to as the 'white prostitutes'.

We don't have a contract yet  That's really what it comes down to. As far as I can see through what you have written you have no legal protection. What work have you put into the business exactly?   Unfortunately it is looking like you've messed up big time by getting other people involved and still not doing any legal work at all. Technically, the idea isn't yours. He can use it and produce it as his own business, its a shitty move but it happens all the time.  As others have said, threaten to sue. Talk to anyone who could help you put together a legal (or even legal looking) threat about this and generally scare the shit out of him. Tell him that you will ensure any investors are aware of these legal threats.   If possible perhaps you could quickly set up a competitor (I guess you understand the business better than him and coders are easy to find).
It takes more muscles to have your mouth open than to keep it closed!  First time that fact has actually come in useful for me..!
As someone who has actually gone through clinical depression and generalized anxiety disorder, I think it is fair to say that for most people it isn't laziness. I have had days where I have sat in front of a computer trying to will myself to work for twelve hours straight and just can't, full on wrestling matches with myself in my own head to try to get out of bed. After a while of this stuff piling up you deserve to acknowledge that you are mentally ill, give yourself a break and not be labelled lazy. I'm not sure the 'psychologist' really knows what they are talking about, no serious psychologist/psychiatrist I have seen has ever gone down that route with me.  Take some time for getting better. Keep working out. Try meditation for focus (its easy to learn a few techniques online and it helps to train you to take control over your own mind). Get into a daily routine as best you can. Most people go through 4, 5, 6 different medications to find one that works for them because everyone's brains develop differently so keep going with that. Most of all, stay positive. It will pass eventually, try not to focus on your depression too much, keep treating it and eventually this will pass no matter what shit you have to go through between now and then. Maybe you'll have to take a regular job for a short while, who cares? You will always have time to start another business in the future.
Huh? Are you writing this from 2002? I'd never vote for le Front National and I enjoy some of the EU's benefits, but not *even* Greece?  The fact that the euro has one interest rate that's too high for some places and too low for others has hugely prolonged economic decline and mass unemployment at one end of the spectrum and encouraged bubbles in the Spanish and Irish property markets at the other end.   Even putting the economy aside, in the midst of their crisis Brussels made a joke out of democracy in Italy, pressuring the EU commissioner Mario Monti in as Prime Minister and *cheering* as he appointed a new government that contained not a single elected politician.  A Civitas report last week showed that the United Kingdom (I don't personally know what the deal is for other economies) has not seen *any* more trade advantages as an EU member than it would have as a non-member.  The EU has its benefits, but what you say about it being good for every country involved is just not true. Plus, the UK economy will overtake France's this year and is on a trend to be the leader of Europe by 2030, with the pound.
I have started doing this recently. We just have to keep in mind that there is a difference between getting *drunk* and having a couple of beers after a hard day to help you keep pushing through. Set limits.
What are some things that I could start doing right now to combat clinical depression
Can't tell if troll..
