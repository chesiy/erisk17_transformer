What type of dog is it?
Could've been great at music producing at an earlier age, born into a more richer family to buy necessary software, and make it big on youtube. 16 and still got some time left tho.
??? Believe it or not, I haven't seen Park n Rec. Saw first episode and thought it was a rip-off of 'The Office' which I loved. Everyone was annoying and I only laughed once in the episode in the very end when the dude with the mustache said something about a gun or maybe something about the flag idk I forgot. Seriously though, I'm talking from experience about my fecal situation. You've never had a dry shit?
Christian Bale. He's actually quite a douche if you've seen some videos or heard stories of him behind the scenes. He's the guy who will cuss you the fuck out because you brought him a bowl of green M M's when he likes red.

I just want to be given reddit gold one time. That is why I come back.
Every rendition of Mystique has been very unattractive IMHO. Margot Robbie would be good in the role but I like her as Harley Quinn more.
Are you kidding me...if you wouldn't tap that then there's something wrong with you. http://imgur.com/ozQi8OG
Murkah is my favorite host/guest. But where I think many might get confused with my comment is that Wings brought a certain type of spontaneous entertainment and hilaritiy. And, yes most of the time we would laugh at him but that was what cause most of the best moments on the show ever. Seriously go watch some 'Funniest moments of PKA' videos on youtube 90% the funny spawned from Wings. I love Murkah but he's more intellectual and calculated with his sarcastic remarks. Murkah is my favorite host/guest of every single person whose been on PKA but no one truly can replace or replicate what wings did for the show.
Not very hard at all to get into it. Check out busyworksbeats on youtube for things you really need help on. I was in a similar position to you when I was 14 and I started making beats on FL with no knowledge of chords or scales. All I really suggest is buying proper studio monitors. For hiphop production THAT IS ALL THE HARDWARE YOU NEED. Get some good VST's and demos and your set. I've been making beats for about a year and a half and [these](https://soundcloud.com/sonnywane/my-chain/s-unAqy) are the types of things I'm doing now.
But super heat vision can't melt steel beams.
Love to experience 'The Dark Knight' in the theaters for the first time.
Best fictional world to have a first date in?   Pretty self-explanatory...
I thought you were correcting my spelling, but it was correct and I just didn't know what you were trying to convey. Good day sir.
"They just cracked inter-dimensional travel"
Dude, worse could have happened, trust me. Just wait about a month and no one will ever remember that you said that. It really wasn't even a scumbag thing to say in the joking atmosphere. Don't worry about it.
