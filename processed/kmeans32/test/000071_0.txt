Its a horror film
I cant decide between them two
Anectodal evidence of course, but I left my theater today at around 12:30 am and streets were empty. I hung out at my friends house for a bit and on the way home there was a lot more cars, around 2 am, so a lot of people were watching this fight. Movie was awesome btw. The reviews made me lower my expectations, and I wasn't blown away, but it was a great 2.5 hours. Better than furious 7
Watch WrestleMania. It was great
I was soooo wrong on this one. It looked like a bomb to me. Second trailers did help a lot.
I say $210 million. Those presales are surprising me.
Is your MEPS station really far from you? Because if they have to fly you/put you in a hotel, you would probably do everything in one visit.  But if you're close to your station, like I was, you just go on seperste days to do things.  I say research all the jobs military.about.com and the branch websites.
How long have you been following box office?   I remember almost 7 years ago in ninth grade seeing on yahoo news the weekend box office results, I think it was I Am Legend that was on top, and ever since that I would check the box office every monday, eventually finding boxofficemojo and checking daily.  I dont even know why I care
I dont see it Avengers 2 outgrossing the first.   Nope. I say: 90 percent of the firsts gross.  Reasons: I dont think it will be good, the trailers them selves dont scream "must watch" if anything, people are watching just because they've seen the eight other marvel films.  The first one made a lot of money.  A lot.  Many things had to go right for it to go like that, and I dont see those same things happening again.  One thing that might prove me wrong, there's no competition. Mad Max ain't doing shit to Avengers, so it will have some time to gross freely.

Hmmm. Not sure if this is relevant to my post much, but I do write sometimes. Oddly enough, I write time capsule like summaries. Like, to myself. "on 4/2/15 I did this, and I was hoping too". I write these because I'm hoping ill find these amusing in ten years.
Some people live in the past. I live in the future, and I think that might be worst.   I cant help but constantly being in the future. Everything I do, is based on the future. Even this post. As I write it, I'm thinking of the replies and the red envelope.   When I talk to a girl, every little thing becomes a potential snowball. Hmm. She doesn't like action movies... So when we're married, how am I gonna watch new releases?   I'm going to the navy soon, I knew about this eight months ago, and honestly, these months have passed by so quickly and I haven't accomplished anything else beyond waiting. All I do evry day is think about it. I lost eight months of my life. Just waiting.  I quit my job a year ago because I didn't want to be there my whole life.  I forget about the past because it happened already.   Anyone else like this? Any tips?
Transformers 5 to take place in Cuba. Classic cars transforming everywhere.
Um, no, why?
Flash Boys by Michael Lewis, about a recent wall street trend.   Devil in the white city by Erik Larson, amazing book about the 1893 Chicago world fair, its construction and the serial killer living in the city at the same time. I just finished it a week ago and I find myself thinking about the time in which the story takes place a whole lot.   The Looming Tower by Lawrence Wright, not too heavy on narrative, sometimes it feels like an info dump, but a very well written and extremely well researched book on Al qaeda and the cia/fbi on the road to 9/11.
I've read three of his novels and enjoyed them all, but Michael Chabons "Adventures of Kavalier and Clay" seems very intimidating to me. Its about 600 pages and it won a Pulitzer. I feel like I'm going to judge it harder than I did his other books. What if my expectations are too high? What if Chabons style doesn't work past the 400 page novel?
I read AG riddles first book from that trilogy and I skimmed the last 200 hundred pages (the whole second half). Honestly, I dont think it was a well written book, and this one you're reading isn't probably that great either. Just read a summary online of what happens at the end and move on to a better book
Great Lakes. I was lazy. But I ended typing it up anyways lol   Thanks for the ama!
Fuck inflation in regards to box office. All effect it has is negated by the fact that there were less movies and less ways to watch movies back in the day. Saying that Gone With The Wind would have grossed $1 billion in today's dollars is wrong because it only broke records back in the day cause it played for years and it was one of very few movies available to watch.
Go for it dude. I realized three years after graduating high school that I wanted to do it, so I did. Now I'm just waiting to ship out. I wish i would have straight after high school though.
A prophet
11/22/63 was my first of his and since that I've read four more. Its such a great story.
BN.com also has this. I'm a member there so I get free shipping on all orders (dont have prime)
I live in his home area, I hate how fucking thug and ignorant people can be down here. Career criminals are the worst, and more needs to be done in this country to help youths make better decisions.
I read the first one and I liked it a lot. Gonna spread this series out for the next couple years. Great story.
While doing all this do I just block out everyone I know? I seriously don't enjoy anyone in life right now except maybe my sister and my dad. My mom is a huge factor in me wanting to leave.    The military isnt an option because I am disqualified from enrolling because of a marijuana conviction. Right now they don't really need too many recruits so what could have easily been solved with a waiver in the past, now leads to a permanent DQ.
Working out is the best thing for the body. Unless science advances exponentially in the coming years, you're going to be stuck inside your body for the rest of your life. Might as well make it the best body possible. Join a gym or workout at home its all up to you. I started just doing body weight exercise, just to have some strength, and eventually I wanted more strength and joined a gym. Amazing decision that has left me feeling and looking great.
I don't agree with your predictions at all. No way is the sequel to a movie that had long legs and great word of mouth going to open less than the first.
Sequel to be titled "War of the Planet of the Apes"
Why you gotta say spic tho
Is there a difference? I thought they usually meant the same thing
I party occasionally, but when I do, I stay next to my friends the whole time. I don't really like meeting new people.   That first moment when I walk into a party or place with a lot of people, I feel some anxiety, but it goes away if I'm close to my friends.
