[Dragon's Egg](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Dragon's_Egg) by Robert L. Forward. Absolutely magnificent. I'd link to the wiki, but it gives away the whole plotline. But here's some reviews.  "Knockout ... One of a handful of books that stretch the mind." ~ Arthur C. Clarke  "A tour-de-force meticulous creation of an unbelievably alien race ..." ~ Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine  "This is one for the real science-fiction fan."  ~ Frank Herbert, author of Dune  "DRAGON'S EGG is superb. I couldn't have written it; it required too much real physics." ~ Larry Niven  "Never in the history of science fiction, I think, have so many of the most exciting contemporary scientific concepts played a role in a book." ~ Frank D. Drake, Director, National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center  "Exemplary hard SF . . . There is no more dazzling practitioner of the form." ~ Locus  "Forward has impeccable scientific credentials, and ... big, original, speculative ideas." ~ The Washington Post  "Forward's plot, both simple and grand, is the whole history of an alien civilization and the effect contact with us has on it. Those who crave real science along with their fiction will be mightily pleased with this mind-expanding and engrossing example of SF in its purest form." ~ Publishers Weekly  "Dazzling, beautifully worked-out scientific extrapolations ... An adventure that's sure to please fans of 'hard' SF." ~ Kirkus Reviews

No.
Our Rules were adopted in consultation with our subscribers, we don't change them lightly. Paywalls aren't an issue that comes up much, but I've initiated a mod thread to discuss. Agreed, they're a pain. There are other non-paywalled sites running the story, or you can google the title and get unpaywalled WSJ article from search links, but I'm leaving this post as it's not against current rules, and at the least will make people look it up if they want to read more. But yes, annoying.

He did say in the Foreword:  The country in which I lived in childhood was being shabbily destroyed before I was ten, in days when motor-cars were rare objects (I had never seen one) and men were still building suburban railways.  Recently I saw in a paper a picture of the last decrepitude of the once thriving corn-mill beside its pool that long ago seemed to me so important.  I never liked the looks of the Young miller, but his father, the Old miller, had a black beard, and he was not named Sandyman.
