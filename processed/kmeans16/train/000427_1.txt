Interacting with people who are not nice.
Ha. Yeah.
Thanks.
Yes.
That's awesome. Happy for you. I am actually lucky enough to have a few close people that are pretty understanding.
What.
It was just so much dialog. I didn't find it charming. Usually Terentino's films have great monologs. I really can't stand Pulp Fiction either. (I know, I'm a bad person) it just doesn't do it for me. I love everything else by him.
I am specifically talking about people like that though. I didn't get too specific in the main comment because I didn't think it mattered and I didn't expect anyone to pick it apart. I just answered the question.
Same. It's one of the only things in my life currently that I actually like. I will think about quitting when I can have a life again.
I'm not *too* radical. It's fine if it's not your thing. But before I lost my health I worked at a dog rescue that currently has about 500 dogs, not to mention the hundreds more they have been placed in homes. If it weren't for crazy dog people like me there would be millions of innocent and loving dogs with no homes and the amount of strays would be an even more substantial problem than it already is.        If someone doesn't like me because of something like that I will gladly not have them in my life. Which has always worked out because it gives me more time to be with dogs as well as people who love the same way I do.
I accidentally tripped my cousin while she was super pregnant. She caught herself so it was fine. But yeah.       Also my  best friend and I had discovered masturbating with the shower head at about  10 or 11. We would shower together and take turns. We knew it was sexual but didn't really understand nor did we put much thought to it. We just knew it was awesome. The dialog that went on though. Oh jeez. "Hurry up its my turn!"... "Hold on I haven't twitched yet!"        We were weird children.
I wish I never learned that. It's making me uncomfortable and now I'm worried that it's going to come up all the time.
It always works for me. Whenever I have to do it it's because I have a bunch of hard smallish poops that are all trying to get out at once like it's 5 am on black friday. A finger in my whisker biscuit can get those bastards to go single file and I save myself from bleedy fissures that stain my panties in the wrong spot.
To not have chronic pain. I am 23 and have had it my whole life. Now it is worse and I know it will never go away. I have tried everything with no avail. It even caused me to leave my job that I loved. I basically cant function or have a life. Telling my friends I couldn't hang out on my birthday sucked.      In theory I will eventually find doctors that will not only listen to me but actually be interested in treating me. All I can hope for is enough treatment that make me well enough to be able to take a shower and go to the grocery store in the same day.      I am at the point where if I were diagnosed with some aggressive form of cancer I would be relieved. At least they would have to treat me.         EDIT: It's nice to hear from the rest of you chronic pain homies out there. We are a large but quiet breed. If you haven't visited /r/chronicpain I highly recommend it. I have gotten a lot of comfort through that sub.       Also I have  a connective tissue disorder so it won't be getting better.
Wow, that's crazy.
I believe in equal rights but I try and avoid feminism and preechy people in general. Just because I like my armpit hair doesn't mean anything.        I don't think labeling people is really a fair thing to do and personally I have many influences so there is no single category I feel comfortable being placed in.      But when it comes to my fashion sense there are a lot of hippie influences including belly dance and fire dancer kind of apparel. Most of my friend groupe is pretty punk rock so I do a lot of that. I really like the 90s punk style.         So I am whatever that's called.
