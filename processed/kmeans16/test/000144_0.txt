First, very few emails now days are sent in plain text unencrypted.  Almost all users have started using TLS, which means the emails would be transmitted encrypted in transit.    You missed the point. It doesn't matter if the user accesses his email securely, because the emails themselves are sent over the internet unencrypted. Any server that processes the email (of which there are many "hops") can see it.  On the third point, if you have the key, then you have to be able to see the traffic between the site and the user in order to decrypt it.  That means you have to be tapped in very close to the server or very close to the end user.  Neither of those are easy, most require physical connections at the location.  True a proxy server would be a great way to go, but the user would still need to be using the proxy server.  It is simply too much work to steal an SSL key and then try to get that traffic.  Sure, if it were Amazon or Bank of America, then yea, go for it, having a key like that might be really useful.  Having a key for Bob's Putty Store who sells putty to 20 people a month isn't going to be as useful.  Bob's putty store doesn't need HTTPS if he doesn't need the security of HTTPS. This effectively reduces the security model of HTTPS to HTTP+email interception.  If you signed up for HTTPS, you should expect your keys to be safe.
While it sounds all insecure, really, there are far easier ways of doing that attack that don't require hacking an email, then finding and setting up an MITM style attack or snooping on a connection.  First of all, you don't need to hack an email; these are sent in *plain text unencrypted*, so anyone on the network path it was  on can see them. Second, if it's so useless, why don't you publish all your SSL keys for all the websites under your control?  Third, what "easier" method is there for passive decrypting https connections or actively mitming an https connection than this?   The end user would need to be identified, then a MITM attack or network snooping setup on them.  Or set up a proxy server, then mitm all https connections through it that you've got the key for.
There is no audience here.  Maybe you should consider the possibility that I'm being honest here, then.  You showed up, feigned ignorance and produced a ludicrously biased study, and then 10 more that supported it.  I just went through all my comments on this issue. The ones which had any non-reddit links at all were https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3bm7fp/colorado_court_rules_use_of_public_funds_for/csntdkm?context=3 https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3bm7fp/colorado_court_rules_use_of_public_funds_for/csntkmg?context=3 https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3bm7fp/colorado_court_rules_use_of_public_funds_for/csnu5xt?context=3 https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3bm7fp/colorado_court_rules_use_of_public_funds_for/csnwoqc?context=3 https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3bm7fp/colorado_court_rules_use_of_public_funds_for/csny3kd?context=3 https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3bm7fp/colorado_court_rules_use_of_public_funds_for/csnzrly?context=3 https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3bm7fp/colorado_court_rules_use_of_public_funds_for/cso821h?context=3 https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3bm7fp/colorado_court_rules_use_of_public_funds_for/cso92m3?context=3 https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3bm7fp/colorado_court_rules_use_of_public_funds_for/cson1qu?context=3   After excluding the ones on law or otherwise irrelevant to this particular issue, and duplicates, the only sources I quoted were  http://www.hoover.org/sites/default/files/uploads/documents/0817938923_51.pdf  http://www.cato.org/publications/briefing-paper/what-would-school-voucher-buy-real-cost-private-schools http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pam.20113/abstract http://educationnext.org/debunking-a-special-education-myth/ (which I didn't use as a source, but to start a discussion) http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703864204576313572363698678  The other sources were *all* from https://nces.ed.gov/, and were raw data as opposed to analysis. I don't think there's much room to accuse me of bias in looking those up and linking them.  The four (not 10) sources that I did quote were generally the first analysis to come up on searching for the topic in question, each time. For example, seaching for https://www.google.com/search?q=who+uses+vouchers brings up Hoover as the first relevant result, searching for https://www.google.com/search?q=private+school+vouchers+costs brings up cato as the first result, the peer-reviewed study was written by the same authors as the hoover paper and was found while researching that one. For the WSJ link, I was actually trying to find out whether buses are included in certain public numbers, and specifically if private school buses were, so I searced for https://www.google.com/search?q=public+school+costs+include+busing. The first two links are local, so I ignored them, the third is governmental and I linked it, the fourth didn't quite break down what I was looking for, the fifth was irrelevant. When I came across the wsj one, I realized it contradicted the comment I was replying to, so I used that and stopped looking for what I'd been looking for before then. (I think this is reasonably accurate, but it is based on memory, so it might not be 100%.)  That should hopefully be sufficient to show that  You showed up, feigned ignorance and produced a ludicrously biased study, and then 10 more that supported it. Basically the only 10 studies extant, that in isolation could shore up a view that is categorically false.  is not an accurate description of what I did.  That's possible, but as it turns out, I'm not starting with an ideology and then seeking data to ram into the hole I've shaped because of it and ignoring everything that doesn't fit.  On the other hand, you don't have good reason to believe I am, except for your belief that "someone disagrees with me" implies "that person is deliberately wrong, no one could be mistaken, especially not me". I've laid out parts of my reasoning process throughout, and I never said I'm believing anything for ideological reasons.  Other posters have raised some of the obvious issues, and your responses have been...at best....suspect. "Sure, busing is an externality included in public budgets, ignored by most private schools..but um, I know some with buses!" etc.  They said that *all* public schools provide buses for free, and all private schools don't; I correctly pointed out that it was wrong. I wasn't saying any other aspect was wrong there.  I don't know what the thinking error is for you, and frankly I'm not really that interested in finding out.  Remember that your only justification that I am making a thinking error at all is private knowledge you've refused to tell me. It's possible my tentative conclusions are wrong, I didn't put in the amount of research required to have strong confidence in the results, but I did enough for "reddit-quality" comments. Your argument would be a lot stronger if you could point to specific evidence that I'm rejecting.  (By the way, I've updated slightly in the other direction after reading through the great lakes report someone else linked, as well as some follow up discussion between the author and someone from cato.)   You think teacher's unions are a problem? You think free markets are always the best approach to public policy?   I haven't studied the teachers' union very much, so I don't have much of an opinion. As for 2, definitely not.  Whatever it is, smashing the evidence until it finally complies with what you want to be true works for you, I'm sure.  Again, in order to claim that you need to point to specific evidence that I've ignored, which you refuse to do. (Also, if we consider your rejection of the cato study above as enough to not be called "ignoring it", then anything I've engaged with to that level was also not ignored. Or you could use your double standard.)  I'm hopeful you gain the ability to think critically and do exceptionally basic research.  I can kind of see how you think I wasn't thinking critically, but you kind of misunderstood some of my points here. I'm not saying that the sources I've linked are sufficient to prove that private schools are objectively better. I know I haven't done nearly the amount of research required to be confident in the results, (and even if I was, I wouldn't adopt your position of no longer paying attention to the evidence after being convinced). When I link such an article, my objective is firstly, to introduce the idea in case the other commenters haven't seen and, and secondly, if there's any major problems with it, someone will point them out and I'll get more info. I'm in no way considering the conclusion conclusive, and in fact I've updated after reading the replies; I still think school choice is important (for a number of reasons unrelated to cost), but am unsure or less sure of a cost decrease.   If this isn't enough to convince you, what would?
You've offered none, so you couldn't know that even if true.  You also seem to subscribe to the claim that nobody is ever wrong by mistake, which has the two implications of  1. You can never be wrong, since you know you aren't deliberately lying and 2. Anyone who disagrees with you is stupid.  These are some extremely dangerous views to hold, and it can lead to you to ironical situations like this where you refuse to defend your view because you think it can't possibly be wrong *and* anyone else can see that as well, yet criticize me when you *think* I would do the same.  I don't have much hope of changing your mind about epistemology, but I'll try one more time.  You clearly profess the belief that one should change one's mind on encountering evidence. You (incorrectly) think I don't possess that, and therefore you consider it a waste of time to introduce facts. I don't see a good way to convince you otherwise; I could make a list of previous views I've changed my mind about, but you could dismiss that as dishonest anyway.  Anyway, given that one should respond to evidence, under what circumstances would you change your mind? You believe that when you're sufficiently sure of something, it's impossible to arrive at an incorrect conclusion by mistake, so wouldn't that mean *you* should reject all new evidence? If that's the case, then you do consider it rational to disregard evidence in some circumstances.
On your first point, I asked for a source for the parent comment's assertion, and quoted a study that went a bit into the numbers. If you have anything better, I'd like to hear it.  On your second point, this isn't your tax dollars; it's those parents, who also pay school taxes. Also, if they're charging less than public school costs, then the aspects that aren't part of public schools can be thought of as for "free".

I also don't think the question is valid.  From your next part it sounds like you think the answer is simple. But that doesn't imply the question is invalid.  Always minimize loss of life.  If you have to choose one life over another choose the one with least property damage. If both are equal in all respects (probably will never happen) choose the driver.  That implies killing the least number of people if possible, which is one possible answer. However, note that the driver might not like this, and might not want such a car.  There are ethical problems with designing features that only hurt the owner.  It's definitely not as simple as you make it out to be, there's also the many people who don't think we should kill one person in the trolley problem and so on.
There seems to be some sort of entitlement that users in here can dictate exactly what services provide them.  The other extreme is not allowing any user complaints. Your logic would say that no one can ever complain about anything a company did, with the possible exception of actually illegal actions.   I think some people need a refresher, that if an organization is providing a service, and you do not follow the rules, there is a good chance they will not serve you.  Which rules? Their terms do not mention any restrictions on email.  If you would prefer to work by your own rules, you are free to create your own platform.  Would you say the same to someone complaining about Paypal's policies? Obviously nobody is forcing me to use circle, but why is complaining illegitimate?  Would you say the same to someone complaining about Coinbase closing accounts that donated to Gwern?  I would imagine there is a reason behind this, perhaps overlapping from the promotions when they were handing out free Bitcoin for accounts.  I've been ID verified and got no bonus, so that doesn't apply.  If you don't want to, I don't really see a reasonable explanation why Circles policies should adjust for your individual case...  If they want to disallow some emails, they should at least tell me on signup, or make the policy change public.
What kinds of fees are we talking about?   But when **transaction** fees go up  I know we're talking about transaction fees, I mean numerically how high.  Yes, if usage increases then fees have to go up. Even Bitcoin isn't immune to supply and demand, and remember that you're the one assuming the 20MB blocks are already filled up. If the number of transactions you can fit in a block is fixed, and more people want to push transactions into the blockchain, the price of each transaction must go up until there is equilibrium between transaction demand and transaction supply again.  If the blocks are completely full, then sort of. But what if the max blocksize is variable, and expands if more transactions show up? (And yes, it's more complicated than that, which is why there are developers running tons of simulations to try and figure out what's best to do.)  Fees go up - less tumblers used - tx volume goes down (since non-bot volume can't increase to match what computers could put on the blockchain).  Why do the fees go up in the first place? And remember, these fees are starting at 1/20th of the current fees, assuming 20MB blocks.
That was basically done in the original post (the one with the math and theory) and the response it got is basically "try it yourself"  He doesn't claim to be a physicist.  Never let the ideal textbook calculations or simulations get in the way of empirical data. I test for a living. I learned this my first week on the job 13 years ago.  Which is just.... terrible.  I agree. OTOH, they also mentioned a paper that agreed with them on the math, so either one paper is wrong, or misinterpreted, neither of which I have the expertise to judge.
http://hashingit.com/analysis/33-7-transactions-per-second  says the same, and it's from 2014.
The second of the ones I quoted, or  sabotage bitcoin by excluding clients and nodes  Sorry I was unclear.  I agree that if limits are set too high, then one small miner can do this. My system would allow anyone to bid for the blocksize, so it will be chosen by those who most want it, as in the Coase theorem.
That Chocolate Study
It's a distinction without a difference in this case. So he knew he was doing something illegal, ergo he got caught and is going to jail.  No argument here.  I really don't understand what you are arguing at this point.  Your claim that he "knew he was doing something wrong", which I think is not supported.  I get it, he's is your hero  I haven't said that.
What I think will happen (spoilers even if you've read all)   The first time I read through HPMOR (until chapter 101), I really didn't think Quirrell was Voldemort and behind both the Hermione plots. The main reason for that was because Dumbledore had a lot of evidence pointing towards him, and I kept on switching back and forth between thinking Dumbledore did one or both of them to Quirrell or some other perp. (What's mentioned in Harry's conversation with Lucius seems to pin it down, as well as some other things throughout the book.)  Then I saw that [Meta Spoiler](#s "EY had confirmed QQ=V in a retracted Author's note, which confused me. I now think it's almost impossible for that not to be true in at least some sense, or for QQ to not be behind both the duel and troll.")  However, all the evidence that points to Dumbledore is still there, and I don't want to blame *all* of that on Quirrell setting things up.  So my hypothesis is that Q and D are in this together, where "this" is some plan involving getting Harry to fulfill both of their wants.  Evidence in favor of this:  1. Dumbledore accepts Q apparently without needing to know who he is 2. Dumbledore doesn't grow suspicious of Q at any point in the year 3. There are pieces of evidence pointing to both D and Q for the same plots 4. Dumbledore let Harry off too easy for the prison breakout 5. Dumbledore plays along with the plot to get Hermione sent to Azkaban  Pieces of evidence against:  1. Dumbledore lost a lot in the war against V, including his brother (perhaps it's not really him/taken over by Horcrux, or brother's death was staged) 2. Dumbledore appears moral (perhaps he still believes in the greater good/ is trying to achieve immortality despite what he told Harry)  I'm willing to bet for this at 10:90% odds (I'll put up 1 to your 9). Any takers or alternate offers?  Edit: archived at https://archive.today/cZlqY for the bets.
