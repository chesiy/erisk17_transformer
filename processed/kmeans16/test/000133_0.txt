Yeah maybe his parents or descendants had great power so he learned a few tricks of the trade to get by, he's also new like Fish so we don't know anything about him

Is Bullock Bollocksed?   It seems he has a murky past, a dead end job, no missus and now Gordan taking the limelight  I wonder where Bullock is going, will he stay canon or will they throw in a newbie to complete him  Gordon has all the luck, drive and women just falling at his feet, Bullock is most definitely bollocksed
Sexual Tension   Well, Mulder and Scully finally got together in the second film so will that play differently now we have six new episodes to view soon?  One of the things that drived the series was the sexual tension / chemistry between them, the will it or won't it happen every week, it's what kept us coming back for more  So with this no longer an issue, will there still be a spark between them that will produce great scenes, maybe they could add more humour to compensate like a lover's tiff kind of banter between them, that would be entertaining
Yeah me too but it's an odd character to get behind anyway, think early in the season she should have had interests to follow, I heard she was an attorney or something  It would be great if she pursued some job like that and stirs things up in GCPD for Gordon then at night the claws come out and she has an alternate life
Imagine not getting let in somewhere then flashing an FBI badge
Lynne Hamilton / On The Inside   I know this was sung briefly in the cell by the old woman in an episode in the first series but I wonder if the full "I used to give her roses" will feature on an episode soon  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TC38KlmnSo  Maybe in the final season finale it has to be played over the last scenes, they need to do a homage when the final season ends and the prisoners all go on to pastures new  It would need to be Lynne Hamilton credited in the last episode as that song is probably more remembered than any of the Cell Block H characters
So we getting CSI meets paranormal then
Yeah but comics go where no episodes can but I wonder how this will be filmed, probably in HD so will look great but hope it's still on film and does not look too stale, the great thing about the series is it had a certain look to it, light and dark, funny and sombre, it had it all
New Series Theories   I get a cold war feel when viewing some older episodes especially the one with the submarine  When Mulder ran around outside it was so dark and foggy and very unnerving  The tension of the set pieces and the music really added depth to average scenes  Really hope the new mini series adds very post 9/11 and interconnected paranoia to the series as I know it's only six episodes but they all need to have a powerful message of current states of affairs
Wasn't The Freak put in jail in the original Cell Block H, I know she had lots of fights with Queen Bee
Bad Photoshopping
Easter Egg Archive   We need an extensive archive of all the little Easter Eggs littered throughout the season, I for one have seen multiple bats on buildings and in smoke and obviously in the pilot with Wayne's parents on the floor shaped as a bat, then there's the leaf when Bruce fell down the hill  The Riddler ? on the cup was the most blatant one and there's the Killer Croc reference when Bruce was sketching in the book  Then the collage of Arkham that Pengy did had the speech bubble saying oink
Ivy Pepper   I sure hope they give her far more screen time next season as she has barely been noticeable in the first season and the young actress Clare Foley is a great choice, very creepy but strangely alluring for a kid but largely under utilised  We need to see her pull more pranks and see her back story with her parents and what she gets up to, Ivy has just as much influence in the Batman universe as Cat but it seems Cat has gotten all the attention in season one
