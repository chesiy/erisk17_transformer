The show was so slow that at times it seemed to be almost plotless. I half think that Simon made it as an experiment to see if he could put out a show where almost nothing happens and see if anyone would watch it.   I loved the show. I loved the characters. I loved the music. I was tremendously sad when it was cancelled.   But I don't think I ever said, "I wonder what happens on Treme tonight" because I really didn't care what happened. I just wanted to pop open a beer and spend an hour with Antoine Batiste, Albert Lambreaux and the rest of the gang.   I lot of people have problems with a show like that, so they didn't watch it.
Just to be clear, there's no law that says a 1099 workers should be paid more than a w2 worker for the same work. It's just a general business guideline. An employer is free to pay an independent contractor whatever rate is agreed upon.  On the other hand, if you have been improperly classified as a 1099 worker, the IRS can reach back quite a ways to sanction your employer. The only real benefits for you would be a possible rebate of self-employment tax that you paid to the IRS in those years as well as eligibility for unemployment insurance.  http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses- -Self-Employed/Independent-Contractor-Self-Employed-or-Employee
How FOX Sports will use drones at the U.S. Open, and why the FAA is watching
Yes. I dated this one girl. She was actually my first. She took my v-card and then dumped me a week later to date one of my friends.  Then, about a year later, she dumped him and started dating me again. We were together for the whole summer. I started a new job in August and she dumped me a couple weeks after that.  She ended up marrying one of my (other) friends and moved with him to live in a trailer park in Montana. That didn't last and they headed back east and split up.    I got married (to someone else) and lost track of her after a while. A couple years back I decided to Google stalk her and found her FB page. We reconnected a bit and had lunch last year when she was in town.

Make no mistake, this kind of internet vigilantism is only going to get worse as years go by.   Look at some kid the wrong way or sit on the train with your legs spread too wide or make a dumb joke to your seatmate at a conference and some righteous defender of all that's right is going to whip out their bat phone and make sure your supposed transgression is spread to the furthest corner of the world.  Welcome to the fishbowl.
Nicely done, although the song is doing a lot of the heavy lifting.  I accidentally played the S2 teaser trailer at work and as soon as the sound came out of the speakers my co-worker spun around and was like, "Holy crap. What's that?"
I am amortizing the cost of the battery over the amount of energy it could reasonably be expected to produce. How you intend to use the battery is irrelevant. If you have an issue with my calculations, I'd be interested to hear it.   As for your calculations, the numbers you're using are way low. To disconnect from the grid you'd probably need at least two, probably three batteries to account for days with low or no sun. Even assuming you do the install yourself, which wouldn't be allowed by Tesla at this point, you haven't even added in the cost of an inverter to your package.  Unless you really want to get off the grid for some reason, grid connected solar with net metering and energy buyback from your electric company makes a lot more economic sense at this point than buying a $3000 battery.

I always find it fun and a little mind-boggling to talk about this stuff.   I bought my first computer in 1983 with money I saved from my paper route. As an aside, there's another thing consigned to the dustbin of history, the paper route.  I got a Commodore 64. It cost me $300. The price had just been cut from $600 and I jumped right on that. I couldn't swing the money for a floppy drive, so I got the attachment that let me save my programs on a cassette tape. Later on I'd get the money for a real disk drive and a 300 baud modem. I was living in the future.
Some professional sports teams sneak a "state of the art" clause in their stadium deal, forcing state and local governments to fund an unending series of upgrades and updates to their arenas addition to the huge expense of building the place in the first place.
As high as necessary to make the job worthwhile for you.  The only thing I'd say is not to get ahead of yourself. You don't know what their offer will be or even if you'll get one. Wait until you have the  numbers, then decide.
Here's a more complete account, for those of you reticent to give clicks to WND.  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2010610/The-Ghost-Boy-The-uplifting-story-Martin-Pistorius-survived-mystery-paralysis-love.html
Except that this is not true at all.   The US Attorney's office released some "get tough" press release where they said Aaron was potentially facing thirty or fifty years in prison or whatever. They took all the crimes he was charged with, added up the max sentences and voila, he's spending the rest of his life in prison. You see this kind of thing all the time. Blah blah person is facing SIX HUNDRED YEARS in prison or some nonsense.  Except that Federal sentencing doesn't work that. There are guidelines based on intent, damage caused, the number of offenses, etc. Given the circumstances it was very unlikely that Aaron would have gotten more than a year and even possible that he would have gotten off with probation.  It's a little confusing for some people because the CFAA, like a lot of federal crimes has a hefty max penalty, 20 years in this case, but no minimum.
I watched Sunset Blvd for the first time a few months back and it didn't really do much for me. Maybe it's because I've seen bits and pieces of it used and parodied over the years, but it seemed mostly silly and hokey and old fashioned.  I watched Double Indemnity after that and I was like, "Holy shit, why did nobody ever tell me this movie is so good?". That whole film is so good from beginning to end and it seems much more modern, if you can say that about movie made when Hitler was still a going concern.
