Yeah I know it's a real thing. But it's presented weirdly here. The way they hover then zip up quickly, the way no-one seems to notice it. It just pulls me out of the relative reality of the game.   Edit: Again, downvoted for voicing my opinion in a polite manner and not insulting anyone in any way. Well done reddit.
I used to feel the same until I realised I was the one in the wrong. I used to pull up along side the train because that would make sense. The trick is he can only hit enemies that are on the screen. Once you know this fact the mission becomes insanely easy. I always have the Vagos killed before the train enters the tunnel these days.  Edit: Downvoted for letting people know how to do the famously hard mission easily? What the fuck?
What's gonna happen when my watch doesn't get updated for gmail, gps, and any other useful function?  Then you got 2 good years of fancy watch uses, now you can go back to your phone and you're still left with a cool watch that tells the time. You could probably still make calls and send texts using it too.
It's not a bad style per se, but when you compare it to the cutscenes from any previous MGS game they're an embarrassment. I didn't know a storyboard was going to tell the story before I bought the game. When they started I was like "I really fucking hope this is just the intro and the whole game's story isn't told this way."  And so I was disappointed from the get go.
You can get lunchboxes by completing some challenges. The lunchboxes have given me some great loot that I've not come close to finding in the wasteland yet. I haven't bought any lunchboxes yet though. They gave us a few near the beginning to whet our appetites, now they're really few and far between.
Good response, thanks.
I know man. It was "coming soon" for what felt like months. then it arrived and was immediately removed because it somehow still wasn't ready.  I'm beginning to think this game is being supported by monkeys. I haven't played for over a week. I refuse to play until Raiden turns up. Even then, the combat is just pretty boring compared to Injustice. I don't know if I'll eve get back into this game. Very disappoint with it from day 1 to now.
Not the most American thing I've seen, but it's too awesome to not post here. And I'm English.  http://i.imgur.com/6WDf03g.jpg?1
Whoa whoa now, take it Eazy-E. There's no need 2-Chainz the subject like that, and that's the way it is. I wouldn't expect anyone to Bow Wow at my feet. When I'm sitting on the Lil Jon like a Big Boi you might mistake me for an Ol' Dirty Bastard, but fear not, that's just the Ice-T treating my bladder like a Flo-Rida, making me need to take a Wiz... Khalifa.  Oh my tired Akon bones. I knew I shouldn't have been testing out my new DMX at the skate park earlier, those things are Common anyway. I think I'll give it up like I just don't care before I Busta hip or something, then my leg would get all Puffy and I'd have to put a really big Ice Cube on it to dull the T-Pain.  I went to see the Dr. Dre for a check up and he told me there'd be a Diddy fee. Which was nice because I was expecting something B.I.G.  50 Cent is all he charged me, as thanks I bought him a 2-Pac of his favourite beer and a sole Eminem, a blue one. He asked me "How Kanye be doing this for me? I'm just working my Method, Man."  I replied "Pharrell the times you've healed me, made me feel better about myself. The least I can do is Snoop around your facebook page, see what beer and candy you like. It's not like I bought you a Gucci Mane bag or anything."  And then I left. I knew he'd be watching every step I take, and every move I make, and I knew today was gonna be a good day.  Iggy Azalea.
Yeah true, I could have worded it better. But I was fresh out of a conversation with one of those pricks and my anger carried over. I think the name is applicable though. Anyone who considers themselves to be a better human being than someone else simply because of the piece of metal and plastic they use to play video games on, is a retard. They claim "It's satire" and "It's a joke!". Well, it's not a joke to the people they insult and try to make feel like shit.
Fine... I'll say it if no-one else will.  Ahem.  Dat ass tho.
Regarding The Predator   If his match win animation doesn't include him whipsering ["Anytime..."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHhCYpnnGoo) to his fallen opponent I'm gonna sow cress seeds into Netherealm's carpets as a sign of protest.
Now the game's been out for a couple of weeks, what's the consensus?   I must say this game doesn't disappoint on the whole. Sure the multiplayer suffers from lag, but the lag seems largely consistent so I can usually work around it. Certainly no worse than MK9 and Injustice as far as I can tell.  The graphics are awesome, not the best I've seen, but definitely "next gen", which is something we've seen too little of since the consoles launched IMO.  Sound design. Top notch! I know they put a lot of work into the sound for the game and it shows. All the right crunches and whooshes are there.  Story mode. The best story mode in any fighting game I've played. Worth playing just for the cut scenes. I'm glad Netherealm put so much time into what is now a largely ignored fighting game mode. I love the fact that as well as each character having their own unique arcade mode ending there's a singular canon narrative to play through that solidifies everything story wise.  Music. Can't complain. It does the job, reminds me of MK9.  Krypt. I think this is a fun way to unlock stuff in a game, best krypt so far IMO.  Basically I'm loving this game more than I was hoping I would. I only have a couple of gripes, but they're small and easily ignored when looking at the game as a whole.  1. No Noob Saibot. My mains are always Sub-Zero and Noob. At least Sub-Zero's good in this game.2 2. Sub-Zero's defaiult costume is ugly as hell! But there's plenty of good ones and the inclusion of the Klassic skin made up for the poor Kurrent one. 3. I miss the avatrs from the old KoTH mode. But oh well.  What do you guys think of the game?
Sub Zero Klassic Skin   Anyone else really happy that this exists? I've always hated the new Sub Zero design. I don't mind the Kuai Liang and Revenant kostumes but god DAMN the klassic skin is too sexy. Feels great to represent my boy Sun Zero with him looking the way I remember. After giving him the MKII klassic skin in MK9 I love the fact they went for the UMK3 klassic skin this time.  Any other costumes you guys are super happy with?

Just saw this on a forum I frequent. I have no context, and no words.
Thoughts after a year of doing Let's Plays   Hey guys. I've been making Let's Play videos for a year now and would like to share some of my thoughts of my experience.  My channel focuses mainly on story driven let's plays, my oldest and most popular series is Skyrim Roleplay Advneutre where I never break the 4th wall. In addition to this I have done let's plays of The Last Of Us (no commentary), Gears of War Judgment, Max Payne 3, GTAV, Metal Gear Solid 2 HD (no kills, no commentary) and Heavy Rain Move Edition (no commentary). I also make and upload random videos like GTA montages and I used to make the occasional Black Ops 2 video.  As anyone who does let's plays can tell you there's much more to it than simply playing the game with a mic in front of you, which I wasn't expecting when I started. I think I've streamlined my process a lot since I began doing this last year and the general quality of my videos has improved as the months have passed.  I seem to be plagued by inactive subscribers, although this may be due to my upload schedule. I always stayed away from a schedule because I didn't want this hobby to start feeling like work, but realised my subs deserve content at regular intervals. So I started uploading my two current let's plays of Skyrim and Beyond Two Souls at 8pm GMT on Fridays and Wednesdays respectively. This doesn't seem to have helped my view count at all. I suspect that because the majority of my  views come from America I should start uploading videos at USA friendly times, do you think this is a good idea?  I'm disappointed that I have nearly 300 subscribers but struggle to get more than 15 views per video, after a year of doing this I've only made $25. I've considered giving up a couple of times but then I regain the passion for making the videos and carry on. Another thing that bothers me is that people almost never leave comments on my videos. I welcome feedback and always respond to the few comments that do get posted. Oh well, if they don't want to leave a comment they shouldn't feel obliged to I suppose, but it would be nice to have some interaction with my fans so I can humanise them. For the last year they've just been some intangible force.  Anyway that's my experience after one year of making let's plays. Let's hope the second year is more rewarding.
