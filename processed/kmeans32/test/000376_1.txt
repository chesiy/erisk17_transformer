Hey man and thanks for answer,   Yeah I really enjoy the "filling" feeling, but I thought something with some kind of knot would be nice.   I know that plug is pretty small and I have no problem to go like 2 or more times deeper.   I was thinking about going for the Chance since I like the knot at the head of it, or shape of it (not sure how to call it), but lately I was considering something with big knot.  I would like to get something that would challenge me, but wouldnt be crazy overkill.   About the firmness, I wasnt really thinking about it, but I think that Firm would be the go-to.   Yeah Im ordering to Czech Republic so Im prepared to pay some extra, but I can deal with that.
Im happy if i at least made your day a little bit better!
Man i feel for you , I just found out Im gonna get expeled out of year beacuse of not doing stuff i was assigned. I have no problem with my grades or anything, I m not being bullied I just cant get myself to do anything. Im just shutting myself in my room and spending most of my time sleeping and I cant find any reason to do anything. Sometimes I dont even get up to watch Tv and i just lay in bed the whole day. The worst part is when my dad found out and he told me that Im just fuckin my life, that i could have done it if i wasnt lazy. And i know he is right but I just cant...      I wish you all the best, hopefully we can both manage somehow :)
Yeah we want to see some pudgeee
Getting me out of my depressions
fair point
Can it be hentai ? Beacuse of yes i would go for Bondage Game: Shinsou no Reijoutachi so my life wouldnt be ruined like forever....

Another of what to do next posts   Hey guys, so I m level 29 right now and i feel like im not sure what do to next.   [Here is my monster list](http://imgur.com/3BrLWD8)    I know im supposed to work on farmin 6* but I m not sure who should it be.     I m able to giant B5. For the monsters , Ellin and Seth are momentarly unruned, moved their runes to fire pioneer and wind pierret, same goes for martial cat ( wanna fuse it) and light Sylph.   Any insight or advice will be greatly appreciated.   Thanks for reading and sorry if i made some grammatical mistakes.
For me it would be Soul Eater,   I was so dissapointed by the ending so i decided to check out internet and found out that the manga isnt even in half when the anime ends.
Hes on reddit. Hes already 7k
[Well here you go] (http://myanimelist.net/animelist/nexxy)
[Well this one definetly takes the crown] (http://i.imgur.com/karLW5E.gif)
mainly Eu east
Try Soul Eater
man those fma ones, dem feels
yeah soul eater needs one hard and akame ga kill would also be nice,   it got so annoying at the end i wasnt able to finish the last episode to this day
I wouldnt risk hugging him
Damn i really wanted that number...
* Meepo - Earthbind * Tinker - Heet-seeking missiles * Tinker has refreshable disable that can catch multiple people and Meepo can shoot 2 rockets 4 times and the best thing is -  * Aghanim 5 Meepoes - 4 rocket each one, I once managed to pick that in Ability draft, its really funny (at least when you are playin it :)).
Well i would probably say Soul Eater  or Noragami  also Black Bullet (curently airing)
