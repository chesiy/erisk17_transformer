This was all shot with the camera on auto, it's tough to work out exposure etc using a small phone display outdoors.  Immediate things I noticed: DJI Pilot automatically saves the video to your phone/tablet, which absolutely destroys the battery. My Note 4 died before I got the third battery into the Phantom. The ultrasonic sensor/visual positioning thing screws with your shots if you're trying to fly smoothly, best to turn it off or fly in attitude if you're looking for stable footage.  A fair bit of chromatic aberration in the final image, and it really doesn't like being pointed into the sun. I was happy to discover after my phone ran out that it'll fly without the phone connected, and because there's a record button on the controller, you can still film even if you can't see - the last 5 or 6 clips were done blind.  Oh, and it hates taking off on a slanted surface. Out in the bush I couldn't find a totally flat spot for liftoff, and the little "whoosh whoosh" warmup routine it does when you start the props ended up tipping it over. Grrrrr. Anyway hope that's helpful to somebody!

The Maron interview sheds a lot of light on this. I don't think you can relegate this guy to "he just does fart jokes" status. Between Wayne's World, Austin Powers and Shrek alone he's created what, 10 or 12 brilliant characters that have all crossed straight into pop culture. The guy is a genius and his vision is incredibly strong. If he wants to fight for his ideas I think he's earned the right.
Here's to you!
I've got a mate with a tiny knob, he's got a great philosophy on it. I wrote a song about him, you might like the sentiment: https://m.soundcloud.com/wrongtown-brothers/one-little-person
Cheers for the kind words. This is no intermediate level bike, it's a monster. I'm gonna try to get hold of some of those 800cc Triumph triples, maybe a BMW F800 GS or a crossrunner. Til I've tried a few I can't really make a call. But they're all huge compared to a proper dirt bike - the KLR and DR650 are decent dirt focused compromises for road/trail touring.
I don't disagree with you - nobody wants to see my ugly mug. Unfortunately I don't always have time to go and make appropriate vision to cover every second of the voiceover, and a talking head makes for an easy edit. I've done plenty of others the way you've suggested but this time the bike was back before I had written the story. Sorry!
You're very kind. Here's another I wrote in the same job :  My lebanese wife's shiny locks Sprout from armpits, back, arms and her box. Her pubes are so long And so thick and so strong That she knits herself into her jocks.  You might think it's strange for a man To permit so much hair on her can But it brought us great mirth At our eldest son's birth; He came swinging out just like Tarzan.  I'll confess, though, I'm catching the bug; Even though she's quite ticklish to hug - And the 'stache on her gash Sometimes gives me a rash - It's like rooting a fine persian rug.
Here's a 4-stanza mini-epic I threw together on a really boring job site once:  My lesbian friend said "I'm horny,  But fisting's beginning to bore me.  With five fingers up it,  I feel like a Muppet.  I'm sick of my b1tch speaking for me."  I replied "the solution is clear.  It's p3nis you're needin' my dear.  They're built for the job,  Plus they'll fit in your gob  And I happen to have one right here!"   "What luck!" said the lass, "I might screw you.  I've never been that fond of hoo-hoo;  A big pair of tits,  They're my favourite bits,  And most men ain't got 'em but you do!   I was slightly offended, but fark it -  It's not every day I can park it.  Most girls aren't impressed  With my man-booby chest  But it's big in the lesbian market.
As a motorcyclist, it's extraordinary just how much you can feel the difference when you get right up the bum of a truck. I've used it as a technique to squeeze the last few miles out of a low fuel warning, you need almost no power once you're in the draft.  Having said that, I've been playing with an adaptive cruise system lately in a test car, and that seems significantly less fuel efficient than the way I'd drive if I was operating the pedals. It slows down and speeds up quite aggressively to maintain the distance you choose from the car in front. I'd guess that early self driving cars, before they begin talking to one another, will be less energy efficient than fuel-conscious human drivers.
You and I could work as hard as we wanted and not end up with his size, strength or bounce. Even among NBA athletes, most of whom work like bastards, he's an outlier.  Edit: missed your point entirely, play on!
Highlights: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsvBg9UQXus  You know, looking back on it, there were some great dunks but the competition itself has always been a joke. Nique's two handed windmill with his head over the rim scores 45 and Jordan gets a 50 for the same dunk he did in the semi round? C'mooonnnn. As a kid this was a really huge thing, but looking at it now, I kind of understand why the name players wouldn't bother with it.
You start with the body - tall, lean, strong. Unbelievable athleticism, the league had never really seen anybody who could just hang in the air so long. Watch the old game tapes, Jordan would elevate for a shot, wait for the defenders to drop out of the air, then shoot right over the top, have a coffee and come down. His hands were gigantic too, he could palm the ball at will, giving him amazing control on the dribble, or in the air, or grabbing steals. And his speed was absolutely stunning, in the open court he had an extra gear that nobody could keep up with. 90% of the time he looked like a coiled spring, running conservatively, but then he'd explode and it was amazing to watch.  Then there was the offensive skills - his touch was absolutely ridiculous, nobody has ever come close. He'd make layups the league has still never seen again, changing his mind two or three times in the air and kissing it in with a little spin off the backboard. His post game was just unreal to watch, that turnaround fadeaway was so deadly. He was an absolutely electric scorer, if the ball was in MJ's hands something amazing could happen at any second. Excellent vision, too, finding teammates or punishing a sloppy double - and if he got a sniff of the rim, he'd rise up and posterize ANYBODY in his way.  You could talk about defense - that sprung from his ridiculous motor. The guy was just ON all the time, an absolute energy factory and there were rumours he'd party all night and turn up and still demolish you. He was a constant threat on defense, not just on his own man, but a demon in the passing lanes for steals and most games he'd have one or two out-of-nowhere flying blocks as well.   The competitive spirit and iron will just burned in him, he was the ultimate win-at-all-costs psychopath, to the point where it almost looks like it's ruining his life after basketball. He took *everything* personally, in fact if there was the tiniest reason to get pissed off with somebody, he'd make it his mission to destroy and humiliate them, and more often than not, these were his best games. Having said that, he never took a game off. You see LeBron and the heat coasting during the regular season - that would never happen on a Bulls squad, they just had a fire inside. 72 wins in one regular season is evidence of that.  And on top of all this and his many other gifts, he was also the most stylish player ever to take the court. Everything he did just looked so damn beautiful and in control. He was loose and fluid, but incredibly strong and athletic at the same time. If you played ball in the 80s and 90s, you'd see so much of MJ's style in the other kids - tongues out, scoop reverse layups, jumpman leg splits, people just wanted to be him. It sure didn't hurt that his Nike PR team concealed what a knob he was from the public so impeccably.   So yeah - perfect storm. Outstanding physical gifts, unparalleled drive to improve and win, smart, skilled, creative, unstoppable and more marketable than pretty much anything the world has seen since.
Anyone else finding L.A. Noire frustrating and annoying?   I'm starting to shout at my telly now, having just come through the Vice section. The evidence is so weak and the questions so vague at this point of the game that you're more or less just guessing in interrogations. Even when you get questions right, you seem to get bugger-all in return. And it doesn't matter if you stuff every question up, the game goes on. It's like a movie in which you twiddle a thumbstick every now and then to get to the next scene.  The action is pretty ordinary and formulaic, the driving is both boring and unnecessary, the city has little in it that makes me want to explore further, the main character is a bit of a prat... Sure, the stories are great and the character animations fantastic - but the gameplay is so fucking irritating that I'd probably be happier if I left it alone and never finished it.  Next to Red Dead Redemption, this feels like a gimmicky vehicle for the awesome animation work of Team Bondi, a half way step towards future games that might put the technology to better use. But that might just be me.
