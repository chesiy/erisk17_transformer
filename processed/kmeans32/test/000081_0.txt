What it comes down to is that I'm borderline sexist and don't really find women ensemble casts that funny. If you enjoy those comedies though, who am I to judge. Carry on.

I have a Bernese Mountain dog and he is the most gentle dog on the planet. He thinks he is a lap dog, despite being 105 pounds. Also, he is so sweet and gentle with children and other dogs. He is simply the best!
My cheeks sweat when I eat green apples. It's pretty weird and I've never heard of that happening to anyone else.
"Omar don't scare."
It woke both my girlfriend and me up. That was a serious shaker. 6.1 has got to be the second biggest earthquake since 89'. I am all for smaller earthquakes, as I figure that will take some pressure off of the fault lines, but I'm not gonna lie and say I didn't jump out of bed and quiver like a little girl haha. Earthquakes are no joke.
I'm really sorry to hear that. I wish him all the best.
What was the coolest animal that no longer exists on Earth?   I was watching Cosmos tonight and it made me wonder what was the most interesting/badass animal to ever inhabit Earth?
Lacrosse
Holy shit dude!

I'm not sure who to believe on this post. However, you posted a well thought out, seemingly informative and reasonable post that seems to be from a level of experience. Most posts in Reddit claim to be from someone in that field, when you can sometimes tell the person is just trying to make something up to sound smart or for karma. You are the only post in here on the other side of things, but you don't have that armchair professional air to your rhetoric. I can appreciate that. Have an upvote.

Responsibility
Maybe a 5 or a 6, I just have seen every episode and picked up on it part of the way through reading your well-written post. Funny stuff.
That is tragic. Sorry for your loss.
I was at a party in college drinking and having a good time when a few kids came over that were looking for some trouble. We were out on the front lawn asking their group to move onto the next party and stop causing trouble and they were getting more and more riled up. My buddy put his hand onto one of them to ask them to move down the block when another kid suckerpunched my friend and knocked him out. He immediately took off running, as we gave chase, and he started to run across the street. Right as my buddy grabbed the back of his shirt, the kid got plowed into by a car.  It was a grisly scene. The kid was hit so hard that he went through the car window. He was slumped over the steering wheel of the car and the driver was sitting there motionless with a look I will never forget. The kid's leg was backward and his bone was sticking out of his leg. He was unconscious for a while and we called the cops to send an ambulance as quickly as possible. He woke up after a while and started screaming in pain and trying to pull himself out of the windshield. He was cutting his hands up real bad and a few of us had to restrain him from hurting himself any further.  Several cops, ambulances, and firetrucks showed up and eventually he was removed from the windshield and taken to the hospital. The car was going 32 MPH according to the police after they measured the skid marks from the car's brakes. The dean of student affairs interviewed me a few times about what happened and told me that the kid had numerous broken bones including the compound fracture of his leg, internal bleeding, a major concussion and needed over 400 stitches. My buddy that grabbed his shirt had to get glass removed from his hand and needed several stitches. The good news is that the kid recovered and returned to school after a few months. I will never forget the whole experience, it was such an intense situation. In a flash of time, a kid's life could have ended, but he luckily was spared. We were obviously pissed at the kid for hitting my friend, but I would never wish that on anyone.  TL;DR: A kid suckerpunched my friend, ran into the street and got hit by a car and ended up halfway through a windshield of a car with terrible injuries.
That guy deserves to get his ass beat to within an inch of his life. I hope you are okay now and with someone who isn't a physcho.
Find a weapon!
I showed up to my construction site early one day and found this guy that would hang around the site all the time named Vito blowing a guy. Found out later that he got killed in a terrible way.
That's a crappy situation
