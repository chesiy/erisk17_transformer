Good points, I think it's a combination of things. We were totally outplayed by England in that first test and it kinda reminds me of the World Cup.  Australia went into the world cup as strong favourites and we choked up against NZ in the group stage but after that loss we pulled our head in and didn't skip a beat the rest of the entire tourney.  We needed that loss in the first test, we needed to have our hubris broken down for a second so that we could perform to out best.  I don't want to take away from England too much, we know that the team **isnt** that bad, the first test showed what they can do. I just think that Australia changed gears heading into this test.  I agree, let's calm down on the alarmist attitude. It's a damn best of 5 lol
Any other Australians out there?  [Splice Big M](http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4013/4549597895_c01ddd7068_z.jpg)

It's an interesting question. I have a friend, this guy is 5'10" and 240 lbs of muscle, he's massive. Every time we go out, he gets swarmed by women. You constantly see him get felt up by random women who don't ask. It's a rather prevalent double standard, that's for sure.   Now to your question, do my friends and I do anything about this? Not really. He's mentioned that he likes the attention, but no so much from the older gals, but we're not going to start confronting the women who do this. He's an adult, he if doesn't want the attention, he can speak for himself.  Now reverse the genders here and it seems like a weird thing to consider.
"Ill get this one, you can get the next :)"  It's that easy.

If if this thread is "Just For Kicks", then why are we posting pants size? :P   M/5'9"/242lbs/**see below**  I'm not sure lol. I really am not. I need to go clothes shopping but at the progress I'm going at, I know i'll just end up needing to buy new clothes in a month or so.  For context I bought an XL hoodie and that fits rather nicely and my 42 inch work pants (which I used to wear without a belt) now need my belt adjusted to the 3rd belt hole. Also, my 3XL shirts are far too big now. I could probably wear an XL comfortably :)
Maybe not ridiculous, but it sure was stupid.  Years ago I had prided myself on always taking care of my phone. I've never lost one or damaged one. This was mainly because I would always be careful handling them and I would always slap my pocket where it normally lives before I leave the house or do what ever.  So anyway, one day I was at the GFs place and in my board shorts. Before I dived in, I did the old thigh slap to check that my phone wasnt in either of my front pockets. Not in there, good job train_subject5967.  So I dive in and have a swim. After swimming around for a while and I lean up against the wall of the pool and feel something poking my lower leg.  **Its my fucking phone**. I now realise that these board shorts don't have side pockets but they have pockets at the bottom of each leg. So that's where I logically stored my phone when I changed.   **TL;DR Phone storage hubris cause the destruction my pursuit of life long phone preservation**
Jenny the fucking whore.  I'm pretty sure I'm lying to myself to think that the whole thing wasn't made up, but I kind of want a closure follow up.  True or false, that story was an emotional rollercoaster.
Oh god this is hilarious, I didn't want to spell the joke out or it would lose its oompf :P  Don't worry, upvotes for you
I did and I feel rather crappy about it.  Many years ago I met and hooked up with this gorgeous girl who was on a 'temporary break' from a guy she was dated (he has the same exact first name as me lol). Anyway, we had a insanely strong connection and she contacted me after getting serious with her BF. So we started a platonic friendship and we had the absolute best time. We became fast friends. Would talk most days and nights.  Things with the BF had always been on the rocks, he was emotionally distant and she couldn't date him anymore. She ended up leaving him for me and we had the most incredible relationship I've ever experienced in my life to date.   I've always felt kind of responsible for it, but I've been assured that the relationship would've been over even without my existence.
I get that, to a degree. It's healthy to have apprehension towards foods that's you know are high in calories. It can however be ok to have a little bit of those types of foods every now and again.  I remember feeling a moment of sadness when I saw how many calories were in a short stack of pancakes with ice cream and maple syrup. It had been years since I've had that, but it all hit me that I won't be eating that stuff for a while.  I guess you don't know what you've got till it's gone.
Fuckin' blowy-upery thingo
If I'm holding a door wide open for you, don't touch the damn door  Get your mitts off my lunch then.

I'm down 35 lbs as of this morning, I'm in the same boat - but I've only really had one person notice my efforts.   The thing is that I had a huge amount of weight to lose (started at 285) so much of the weight I have lost is likely visceral fat which obviously doesn't show on the outside. I'm down 3 belt buckles and 2 shirt sizes though :)   but I'm already starting to feel better  This is the main point, I feel amazing. I get solid sleep every night. I don't sweat as much anymore and aside from some hunger (extremely manageable) I have all the energy in the world.
A clever play on words. I don't care how tasteless the context is or who recites it. I will laugh and I will probably hate myself for doing so.
This is pretty much all you can do. It hurt for a long time, 2 years with someone means there are a lot of things which remind you of them. But time was the only thing which healed it.
I've been consistent with my feelings towards him, irrespective of the internet. I laughed my arse off at his old shit (I still do), but he hasn't made a funny movie I like since Little Nicky.

I've not seen it yet (doing so tomorrow), but this the the one thing I care about. It can suck, it can be boring, but it better not try to reinvent the wheel. The movie could be made with minimal reference to the show, but the main aspects of the show need to be in the movie. Brotherhood, growing up and defining yourself.  It's currently 32% on rotten tomatoes, but from what I read, those who're fans of the show enjoyed it.
misinformation (or lack of information)  While both of these are the problem, I'm sad to say that there is probably more *misinformation*. Which makes me fucking sad.   Think about it, somewhere an overweight person is spending their small amount of spare money on a pill they saw which guaranteed them something for nothing. Or there is someone who has a disease which stops them from being overly active, but because they were always told "you need to exercise to lose weight", they've given up hope and eat their sorrows.  I'm in the same boat as you, I really enjoy the 2-3 gym sessions I do each week. It really is a mental and physical boost. It falls back on the common saying in /r/loseit.  **Weight loss = 80% diet + 20% exercise**
Literally a conversation that 12 year old me and 14 year old brother had about a photoshopped Britney Spears photo.  "It can't be her, she's a virgin and that dude is going to town on her"  "Nah man, look closer. It's in the pooper, so shes still technically a virgin"  "Solid point bro"  Edit: My top comment is now about how my brother and I lied to ourselves as teenagers about anal sex. I hope you're happy Reddit.
The problem is that the second you make the distinction of 'pedophilia is a disease', then you would have to also think 'homosexuality is a disease'. How well has conversion therapy worked for them? Fucking horribly.  Study it all you want, but I don't think it's helpful to stigmatise people on something they can't control or probably don't want.   Also pedophilia =/= child molester.
It's name is false advertisement.
There is no shame in slowing down exercise and focusing on your diet, in fact if you're experincing discomfort, that's exactly what I would do.   When I first started i was walking *everyday* and while it felt great, after a month I started to get pains in my shins because I was trying to ramp up my efforts. I dialed back the exercise to 3 days a week and I felt so much better. And guess what? My weight loss has stayed the same.   If you do want to keep going, try some lower impact exercises until you lose more weight and gain more muscle. Swiming, boxing, cycling, eliptical, etc. These will all help with your pain issues :)  Also fucking stretch before AND after lol
I'm still weird like that though. I still love the smell of second hand smoke, but I hate the smell of smokers. There are two completely different aromas there. That being said, I won't let anyone smoke in my car, so there are some hard limits.
I still **love** it, over the past 11 weeks I've only had drinks twice. Once for a bucks and once for a 30th birthday party. Otherwise I've been sober. I miss having a beer with dinner, but the way I rationalise it is "I've drank enough beer in my life, I need a hiatus".  I won't be a teetotaler for the rest of my life, just until I get my weight back in check.
(Spoilers All) Why I'm not fully worried about the TV shows omission of a certain Lady.   Hey guys,  I was as shocked and annoyed as all of you when S4 ended without an awesome scene where Merrit Frey gets killed and there is the big Lady Stoneheart reveal. But I'm not yet worried about her character being completely cut from the show, I think most of this talk about her perhaps not being introduced is bullshit and misdirection by D D and Co.  If you look at the books, apart from her reveal at the end of ASOS she doesn't appear until well into AFFC when Brienne encounters her. Since S5 looks to be putting the focus on Dorne rather than the Riverlands, it is perfectly reasonable to think that she may be introduced later on in the season. They can't just have the Brotherhood disappear without and further information.   What do you think? Are you as optimistic as me?  **TL:DR - I'm not yet convinced that Lady Stoneheart has been cut completely yet (no pun intended). I think she will be revealed towards the back end of season 5.**
Our D D experience with LMoP so far! Session 1 (Spoilers LMoP)   Hey guys,  We're currently in our 3rd week of D D for the LMoP starter set and since I'm on my lunch break, I figured I might let you know about our rather fun experience so far :D  So we're playing with 6 PCs and a first time GM.  Our warband is:  - Bow human fighter  - Dwarf cleric  - Dwarf control wizard (missed first session)  - tanky human pirate themed fighter  - Shooty halfling rogue  - Sneaky human rogue   First session brings us to the dead horses, oh noes. Pirate decides to stay guarding the cart while sneaky rogue, bow fighter and shooty rogue go investigate. Goblin surprise round! Sneaky rogue gets hit, takes 9 damage hes on 1 HP. Others miss. Bow fighter kills one with a shot  and sneaky rogue hits the deck. Shooty rogue kills another, rest get cleaned up. Sneaky gets healed. We find the tracks heading towards the hide out and decide its worth saving Sildar, hes a cool dude.  Heres where it gets silly, pirate decides his character has no want to go chasing after this dude, he has his cart full of shit he doesn't want to risk his life when he already has the booty (words to live by). DM warns that he will get no exp or loot if he does this, stubborness now kicks in and his char stays with the cart...  Right, so anyway. Shooty rogue and Bow fighter scout ahead following the tracks to Cragmaw cave. After investigating the entrance, sneaky rogue hears two goblins in the clearing near the entrance gambling and having a good old time, its go time fuckers. We make quick work of them in our surprise round. We sneakily enter the cave, weary of any potential traps and/or patrols. We take the stairs, oh god! Wolfies! They mad and they loud, bow fighter insta-reacts "THEY'RE BEING LOUD AS FUCK, KILL EM" so after he executes these helpless potential friends despite a few of us saying "Arn't you an animal handler? Why not make some wolf-like friends?" doesn't matter, doesn't care.  After scouting the room we decide to press on. Slowly up the tunnel until we see the patrol at the top, shooty rogue shoots, misses. Bow fighter shoots, misses. Sneaky rogue shoots, small damage. OH noes. Patrol flees, wtf is that sound? Mother fucking wall of water. Jesus titty fucking christ, the sneaky rogue moves to the crevasse to the left and the rest go back into the wolf room. We're safe.  Sneaky rogue climbs the two walls to get a view of whats going on, he hears commotion! The rest of his party cross the stream and climb up with sneaky rogue. We see the goblins, its time to die. We engage and kill all of them (sneaky rogue gets fucked up and goes unconscious, saving throws himself back up). A wounded Mr goblin boss dude picks up Sildar and puts a dagger to his neck. Recently awakened Sneaky rogue is convinced of his dexterous skills, he throws his dagger... and rolls a natural 1. Oops. A follow up roll was low enough for the DM to decide that this dagger hit Sildar in the shoulder. Awkward. Sildar passes out. Goblin drops Sildar and gets killed by the party.  Sneaky rogue panics, hes got priors. He grabs the closest goblin arrow, removes the dagger and places the arrow in the wound. Sildar will never suspect a thing. We start carrying Sildar until he wakes up, lucky for Sneaky rogue Sildar says nothing about his wound....Yet. They proceed slowly to the last room scouting ahead we see a bugbear and his mean entourage. Oh noes, this will hurt. Lets hope for a good surprise round. Bow fighter does massive damage and so does everyone else, bugbear dies before he reaches combat. DM exclaims how fucking lucky we are, 2D8 + 4 damage **are you serious**!??!? We only have an average of 9 hp. The party clears the rest of the room without issue.  Its loot time, yay. We carry that shit back to the cart. We laugh all the way back to the bank.  That was the end of the first session, lots of lulz were had and we really enjoyed ourselves. I know it sounded like only a few of us played much, but I left out much of the nitty gritty stuff that the others did. This is a summary after all.   Ill post another thread shortly showing the other two sessions as I think I'm almost at my word limit.  **Too be continued..**  Edit: [Here is part 2!](http://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/2ew0sn/our_dd_experience_with_lmop_so_far_session_2/)
(Spoilers All) If you could ask GRRM one question that he has to answer Yes or No to, what would it be?   Simple enough.  Hypothetically if you could ask GRRM one question which he has to give a yes or no answer to, what would it be?  As much as I would like to confirm R+L=J, I feel that it is all but confirmed. I would probally ask something like, will Jon be a leader in some form (King, warden, etc) outside of the Nights Watch?  Edit: Alternatively, I would ask *Will Dany turn crazy?*
(No Spoilers) Poll results for 'What book are you up to?' for /r/asoiaf and /r/gameofthrones.   Hey guys,  Its been 2 days since I had posted the thread with the poll attached which asked *Which book have you read up to in the series?* in /r/asoiaf and /r/gameofthrones. Now I know that there are a lot of factors into this poll (e.g people who have not read any books are less likely to even open the thread, let alone vote in it) but we did get some interesting results nontheless.  [Enjoy :)](http://i.imgur.com/6KkkOjs.png)  Discuss :3  **Edit for clarification - Both polls were conducted separately from each other in the different subreddits**
