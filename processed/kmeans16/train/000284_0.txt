The OP concerns what Arnold Schwarzenegger is saying, which is news/relevant because it's coming from a well-known Republican figurehead that is extremely popular on Reddit.  I could have chosen from roughly 50 sources; they all repeat what Arnold Schwarzenegger said verbatim or otherwise give excerpts. The source doesn't matter much when it comes to quoting what Arnold Schwarzenegger has to say.  Quoting Arnold Schwarzenegger isn't a big deal and the source is basically irrelevant. Dismissing climate change or its level of seriousness as "science fiction" warrants a source better than almost all the world's climate scientists' consensus on the matter.  The Cato Institute ain't it.
Me too; you're question prompted me to find the answer I had never bothered looking up before.  I don't have insurance and won't for a while, so I hope it's not serious.
Fascinating. Thank you for taking the time to elaborate.
Expressions on the mask, Mark Hamill's Joker, comic book references (Jason Todd's crowbar massacre was a nice touch), fourth wall breaking, absurdist Deadpool imagination sequence, and a perfect ending. Couldn't ask for much more.
I find it weird that OP thinks using the phrase "consenting adults" is a strange thing to say, or even worse, suggests pedophilia. I've used that phrase about a million times when defending my position on same-sex marriage, as in I don't care what consenting adults do so long as they're not hurting anyone.   WTF does "consenting adults" have to do with pedophilia?
His change throughout the first book is for the better. He's grown above what society made him and become what society could be.  The only part I would argue is that I believe he was *always* better. From the outset he knows he's being manipulated and hates it. From the very first violent encounter, he doesn't want to hurt anyone, and of course, the people watching his every move *could* intervene, but they don't, and this recurs three more times.  When he's at the lake and Valentine visits, he's done. He's had it with everyone's shit and she has to talk him into saving a world he's not convinced is worth saving. He sees the military that's been manipulating him as his real enemy and refers to them as such. He always doubted that he was on the right side and never felt in control. Valentine later confirms this on Eros telling him that no one is really in control of their own destiny and that she has manipulated him and was manipulated herself.  The end of the book proves what he suspected all along and also proves that he has always wanted to do the right thing and will search the galaxy to do so. The bugger queen obviously knew he was pure of heart or she wouldn't have created the elaborate set-up for her infant queen based on what she saw in Ender's mind.  I see the story as being about an inherently good person who is too powerful a tool not to be misused. He's like some well-intentioned nuclear warhead that doesn't mean anyone any harm.
You're far from alone.   RT critics: 78%  RT users: 76%  IMDb: 7.2/10  IMDb Arithmetic mean: 7.3.    IMDb Median: 7  IMDb Mode: 7  IMDb Metascore: 69/100   Metacritic: 69  User: 7.3  At a glance, one could logically conclude that, on a scale of 1-10, Brave is between a 6.9 and a 7.8, which would land it "good" territory.  Personally, I gave it a 6/10 on IMDb. It was horrible by any means; it just didn't do it for me.
I know the roundabout so well by now when it comes to these issues because this debate rages every single time a mass shooting happens, which is far too often in this country, and while I would like to see something done and I value human life far more than I do gun rights, I have yet to get a satisfactory answer to this one question: what do you do about the guns that are already out there?  [The United States has 88.8 guns per 100 Americans.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_of_guns_per_capita_by_country) That doesn't mean 88.8% of Americans are armed; rather that's how many guns there are in the United States that are owned by somebody. Let's say we went gun control crazy with waiting periods, mental health screenings, background checks, the works. Hell, let's say we banned the sale of any more guns at all making it 100% illegal to sell a firearm. [There are by various estimates anywhere from 270 million to 310 million guns in the United States.](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/06/04/a-minority-of-americans-own-guns-but-just-how-many-is-unclear/) What do you do about all those?   The best suggestion I've heard is a buyback program, but that's voluntary and costly.   What's the solution? Because until we deal with the reality that the United States has an out-of-control gun fetish, any further restrictions are like saying you can't add any more grains of sand to the beach.
You mean I'm not the only one who thinks [this](http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110710044111/marvel_dc/images/f/f4/Supergirl_Vol_6_1_Textless.jpg) look ridiculous?

"Pastor" Nate Utley promotes Youth E.D.G.E. Indy (a youth group at Colonial Hills Baptist Church) That's all I want to say in the description. I don't want to ruin how psychotic/creepy this video is for you.
Please help! I'm new in town and my mom   grandfather are visiting as tourists! Where do I need to take them? What are the best restaurants (especially Mexican and BBQ?)   I haven't been here 8 months and I've been too busy to sight-see. We're doing the obvious stuff: tower dinner, Alamo, River Walk, etc., but what are some need-to-see places and must-eat restaurants? I want them to have a good time, and I'd like to at least pretend I'm less of a tourist than they are.  INB4: I know how to use Google. I just figure legit San Antonio natives will know a little better than tourist websites.  Also, I'm aware there's a FAQ. It's extremely incomplete and honestly not that helpful.
Dark Knight trilogy mash-up: Batman, Joker, Bane, Scarecrow...
Which DC series would you like see back on the shelves as part of the New 52?   My picks:  Justice League: International - It was just getting good when they canceled it.  Shadow Cabinet: An old Milestone series featuring Icon, Rocket, Donner, Blitzen, Iron Butterfly, Mechanic, Payback, Starlight, Twilight, etc.  Cyborg: I think it's pretty messed up he was promoted to be a core and founding member of the Justice League and doesn't have his own book.  Black Lightning: Very cool superhero who doesn't get the exposure he deserves.  Ragman: He looks cool and there just aren't a lot of Jewish superheroes. He could even join Batman Inc. and be the sanctioned hero of Israel or something.  The Creeper: An entertaining character who, in the hands of the right writer, can be a great read.  Lobo: Yeah, this character reeks of the 90s, but he's kind of like DC's answer to Wolverine.  Hitman: One of the best comics DC has ever published.  The Atom: The on-again, off-again Leaguer has some interesting adventures.  New Gods: It's kind of a classic, and Orion and Darkseid have already made appearances.

Let's see if my fellow atheists like a rare pro-Christian story   Here's a pro-Christian story for you. I drained our bank account today to do laundry and go grocery shopping. I was thirty-something dollars short at the register and the nice, old, Christian couple behind me said that Jesus implores them to help me and my daughter. I thanked them about a hundred times and all they said was "bless you" in return. Some of my faith in humanity has been restored :-)  I'm an atheist and I have been most of my life, and believe me, I know all about the evils of religion and the harm it's caused throughout history and today, but we have to be willing to give credit where credit is due.   Yes, I know it would've been better if they'd done it out of their own personal goodness instead of what Jesus would have them do, but regardless, it was a nice thing to do, and I am grateful.  TL;DR - Christian couple pays the balance for my groceries and I, as an atheist, am delighted.
