Well he got 2 tonight so maybe he'll be able to scrape together some AB's. I agree with you though
Yeah you're probably right. Oh well.
but he's just watching. he's not going to get any playing time with our core back and healthy and playing so well, I would just rather him stay hot and keep hitting.
Why can't Carpenter be good against everyone but us. Curse you fantasy...

"Hey did you see that post about the guy that paid in all pennies?" Yes, yes I did.
I went last summer and my friend and I had the park to ourselves after 8:00. It really is worth the trip.  It's a little jarring at first but trust me if you don't love to far (I live 4 hours away) it's totally worth it.

How much were they though?
I did that for my dc's and it's amazing. Good call. Thank you. It doesn't hurt that they are gorgeous boots
How many seasons have you gotten out of them?
Yeah my local shop does a huge last season's model sale so I'm gonna head down in these next few days. I ride dc's now. I got a good 3 seasons out of em but they're shot. Thanks for the advice
Hey Nathan I am a huge fan and I've seen every episode.   I just want to ask about the girl Rachel. Is that actually how she is or do you exaggerate the awkwardness for the camera? Also when you get her for more than one segment (The Hunk and Quiznos) doesn't she start to ham it up a little too?  Thanks for doing this. Favorite show on television
