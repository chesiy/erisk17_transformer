The dead body in my car.
No man can outmatch my stealth skills aswell as my skills in unarmed combat. I will best any man I come across.
I threw my keyboard out the window and smashed it.
But not just anyone was allowed to enter.
The Ice Cream Man   So back along time ago when I was young around the age of 8 or 7. I was a really intelligent child, but I was also athletic so I played alot of sports. So one day I decided to go down and meet some of my friends at the basketball court near my house. It was a short walk I went down the street, took a right, then a left and I was there.   Except, this day was different when I was on the way there. I was stopped by the sound of the Ice Cream Truck's music. I took a look over my shoulder and saw a car following up behind it looked similar to this: [This](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Volvo343DL1980.jpg)   I took a closer look but it was still far away, I was trying to get a glimpse of the driver. I saw his face and some of his details he had a huge nose, a fairly sized mouth but his eyes were terrifying to my 8 year old self for some reason.   He pulled up right next to me looked at me and said "Would you like some of my Ice Cream?" He was fairly tall to be driving that car so he looked quite squashed inside. I was warned of stranger danger constantly so I knew to walk faster and faster.   He followed me for a good 2 minutes, every 5 seconds his questions turned into shouts. He saw a car coming up the road then shouted at me. "I know where you live, and I'll be back!" I quickly turned around and ran back for my house and when I got back, I locked the door behind me and peaked through the blinds. Luckily he didn't follow me.   There was one small detail I didn't realise about this event because I was 8 years old, he was furiously masturbating in the front, and I no longer wish to know what he meant by "Ice Cream".   The reason I posted this is because I am now 17, and his car just pulled up in my driveway... **Please help me...**

That is the same as me. I play quite a lot of DayZ on medium pop servers (Australian). The one I saw (Actually I did not see them, because they were in the Camo building wall glitch) my friends ran in to try and secure it, because we had a farming hoe. Then suddenly one of them loses their gear, then they get carpet bombed. Luckily I was on the hill outside. This happened at Veresnik.
There would not be a linear story. You could side with Bandits and Heroes, maybe they would both have the same objective, but they would get there different ways. If eventually the devs let us learn their new scripting language and let us build custom mods for SA, I will learn and make this. You wouldn't even need to do the quests, you could just kill everyone and rule the land.
I didn't say that they would completely remove Multi-player. It would be an additional mode, where you get a single player character. This character wouldn't be available for use in Multi-player servers.
[Update] Hill Figure
Haven't broken my legs once at the prison. I have had my legs broken numerous times elsewhere.
Probably not.
I thought it was a Train or a Submarine.
Wait, the V3S *isnt* a submarine?

I would choose a house, put cans in the kitchen, if you could open the fridge and close it, that's where all of my cans and canteens would be. I would have a room in the back of the house for my Armory. Also of course I would have a room where there is a bed and in the closet I would have multiple types of clothes such as: Hunting Clothes, Ghillie suits for scouting, etc.

R.I.P Good Content
I remember my least favourite encounter with a hacker in DayZ, I was running along, SKS on my back, suddenly, in the corner I see "I have emptied my SKS" then my character opens a pipsi and drinks it, just a as a really cool bandit looking character appeared and headshotted me with his fully customized M4. *I hate hackers*
Just join another server if you see this.
This is so true, when admin Logs come out admins will check who killed them, then ban their killer.
Did you also get cancer from that?
[HELP] Making AI eject from a Insertion Chopper I made   I am new to creating missions for ARMA II using the editor and I am creating a small scale mission. I am trying to make an insertion in a blackhawk, except when it lands, it only ejects me and not the rest of my squad. The squad is grouped to the player, but the player isn't grouped to the chopper.
Don't even try to hack. Use money printers in the server, put them underground and somewhere no one will hear it or see it.
Game would probably still be broken by then, how about 3 years?

Sometimes you just have to let go of your AKM.

You forgot one: no servers
