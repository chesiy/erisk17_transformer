there's no secret to gaining elo it's really just a case of working on what you already know like CS well, dont back when your mid laner is roaming (if you play mid that is), dont go for a kill unless you're 100% sure it'll be a success. It really is just a case of working on what you know and making small tweaks constantly. Oh and LOOK AT YOUR MAP MORE YOU DONT DO IT ENOUGH

What if she WAS the weird alien in TPS? What if the destroyer didnt kill her. It changed her and that's why you dont see any alien creatures in BL2 because the destroyer created them before it died. There are so many questions surrounding that character and no one seems to care about her! . I wanna know if she was the siren Lilth was searching for when she came to pandora, they share VERY similar tattoos so it's entirely possible.

FUCK.
Thank you, kind sir :)
As a Zed main i wish they'd fix the W + Q bug and the bug where he just stands still after using his ult
yeh something like that, but if i remeber correctly it's due to the dominion pros practicing on that day or something, so you get paired with super good players xD
