Fantastic story, I for one would love to see where you take it.
MRW I saw the finale of Jurassic World.
Nerf guns.    My 3 year old daughter and I love nerf guns. She has a few that she can operate on her own and I have some that I have to prep for her.   We have a hall way with the air intake on the ceiling and it's extremely fun to watch her shoot a balloon that is stuck on it.   Also cooking with your little girl is one of my favorite things to do. Nothing too complicated, but just enough so that she is learning and feels like she helped.   Wednesday night we cooked pancakes and I mix everything in a blender.  Her job was to press the buttons. The way her face lights up brightens my day.   Pixar movies are also a great bet.
