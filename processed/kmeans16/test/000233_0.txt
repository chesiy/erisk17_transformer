No chance. I went to the last rally more so as a spectator, and the behavior on both sides of the rally was disgusting.   I saw counter protesters assaulting and spitting on people.    I also saw the reclaim Australia people screaming racial slurs and trying to intimidate people in smaller groups.   Honestly it was an embarrassment to say the least. Both sides should be ashamed of themselves. Neither were proving anything except that people are arseholes no matter what side of the argument they are on.
"I have a son, you have a daughter. We'll join our houses!"
Cheers!
Go ahead! I was forced into it but i like how they turned out, the person taking the photo's got some awesome shots of him.   edit- i was forced into doing the topless shots, not the photo's in general haha
My son with my beard.
You are either brilliant, or crazy.   I have not decided
So are the concentrate's just straight flavoring or are they like a doubler?   Yeah i'v got some on order but i have to wait until after Christmas. I used the last of it yesterday so i'm not too stressed haha   merry Christmas to you too
oooooooo perfect, Thanks!   Yeah i already have nic, out of VG though so i cant mix anything until i get that :(
What to do?   It's such a beautiful day, give me something to do. Anything at all.
Centrecom in sunshine are just as bad. I called them to check if they had a certain graphics card, was on hold for 15 minutes then was told they had plenty in stock. I told him I would be there in 30 minutes to grab it and if he could get one ready for me which was all good. Then I get there to find out they dont actually have any at all. Apparently i was the arsehole for wanting the next model up for the same price because they fucked me around.
24, been in the trade for 7 years. finished a 4 year apprenticeship in australia as a fitter and turner/ toolmaker. Moved into maintenence for the dollars but we still have a couple of lathes and a mill we use for repairs, breakdowns and general bits and pieces. Kinda miss being in a proper tool shop though.
when I was 14, i ran into a door at full speed and knocked myself out cold while chasing a friend around his house. the last thing I remember was his mum yelling " stop running around before someone gets hurt!!!" then bam I was out. scored I nifty little scar under my eye from it.
the look on the office ladys face at work when I ran out of the toilet in a rush with my pant down to answer the phone because I thought I was the only person there.
I change my tampon
such a sad day
