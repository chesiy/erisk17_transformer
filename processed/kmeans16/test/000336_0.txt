We also attempted a stuffed crust pizza. Is this enough cheese for you guys?
Congrats!
(Funny)DH and I are obviously not on the same page.   Today, DH and I were texting while he was at work. Out of the blue, he sent me a link to a gun he was looking at (no surprise; he's always looking at guns or hunting stuff). In reply, I sent him a picture of [this onesie](http://i.imgur.com/sJPHyk8.jpg) one of the local hospitals is giving to babies born during the MLB All Star Week. Guess which one of us has baby rabies?
Except Monopoly almost always ends in rage quit...
Are you and I the same person? I started a wish list about a week ago, spent 2 hours one night making it because I was so bored. I only ever talk about baby related stuff; I'm starting to worry if my husband things I'm insane. I'm always reading about how to raise kids and constant worry about being a good mom, which my husband claims is adorable and sweet. I have baby names picked out and often use these names when referring to our future kids (all names are husband approved). So far, I've crocheted 3 baby blankets and one dress in the last month or so and I'm itching to make more baby stuff. I have researched OBGYNs and already know where I want to deliver. I think I need an intervention. Please send help.
I've spent the last two hours looking at stuff on Amazon and adding things to a wish list. This is all your fault haha.
Shame
I was a little skeptical about staying there at first since it's a value resort - I feared it would have a cheap motel feel to it and would be too crowded. We stayed at French Quarter last time and I thought Pop wouldn't be as nice. I must say, I like Pop so much more. Despite being in a room on the first floor, it was fairly quiet (we were on an end in the middle of nowhere though so that might be why haha). The grounds were beautiful and the 50s pool was relaxing - a nice escape from the hustle and bustle of Disney. Absolutely amazing value.
Yay!! We got ours in the mail today. We are leaving May 9th, and I'll be turning 23 while we are there :)
I thought I was the only one who does this. I started doing this hard blinking voluntary twitch thing a few years ago. I thought maybe it was a side effect of a medicine I was one - it seemed to start about the same time I started new meds - but after stopping the meds the hard blinks never went away. I also have bad anxiety so I've also thought it could be a coping mechanism for that too. I feel tension around my eyes and it only goes away when I hard blink. I've mentioned the twitch to doctors and they've never heard of anyone else doing this, so I quit bringing it up during appointments. Even though it is partly voluntary I can't seem to stop doing it.
Have you talked to your professor at all?  My husband was in the same position as you last semester. He was all set to graduate, but he could not for the life of him pass any of his tests in his language course. He had to get a decent grade on his final just to pass - he was averaging 50s on the tests and he needed close to a 75 or something on the final. In the final weeks, he asked his professor for help as much as possible, tried to show he cared about the class and was really trying but just couldn't grasp the content. He also told her that he needed to pass this course to graduate and that he had a job lined up after graduation, which obviously he would lose if he didn't graduate. He studied hard for the final, but he was confident that he failed. However, two days before graduation his professor emailed him and said he had just barely passed the class and he was graduating. I have no clue what he actually scored on his final, but he likes to think that talking to his professor is what helped. She actually was willing to work with him - she offered extra credit and was willing to drop his lowest test grade to see if it would help.   So, if you haven't talked to your professor, I would highly recommend it. Seek all the help you can get. Best of luck.
I'm from Northern Kentucky and can confirm there are tons of people with that last name.   Edit: Wording.
I'm terribly sorry you feel the way you do about your body. I would agree that a therapist is your best bet. Are there no services that offer any type of free counseling in your area?  I agree you probably have body dysmorphia - definitely search the internet and read about it. There are online support groups you can join, or you could just read through people's advice on how to overcome this.   I am 5'9" and I weigh 140 and sometimes I feel overweight as well. But let me tell you what I'm beginning to learn: being skinny is overrated. At your height and weight, you're not overweight; you're probably curvy like I am. Some men (and women too!) absolutely love curves - they're quite sexy. You have to learn somehow to embrace your body, love it. Honestly though, if you're curvy, and not just skin and bones, that's a good sign that you're healthy, and that's what's most important.   Also, you've overcome anorexia? Wow! I'm sure that was tough. That's something to be extremely proud of. That shows that you are strong and capable of getting better.   I wish you the best of luck in feeling better with yourself. Be positive. And find some support from people who know what you're going through.   Edit: spelling and whatnot.
Here is my two cents. Do not be afraid to talk to your girlfriend about things like this.  Don't be afraid to ask "What do you think about me getting you a promise ring?" I don't understand why men propose without ever seriously talking to their girlfriend about it first.  I guess men want the girl to be surprised, which is great, but you need to make sure that the girlfriend is on the same page and wants the same things. The girl can drop hints about wanting it, but that's not talking about it.   Also, don't worry if it's "too soon." If you feel the time is right, then the time is right. My husband and I got engaged four months after we had first met and only three months of dating. I was 19, he was 20, we were both sophomores in college. My husband and I talked about getting engaged after only a month of dating. We talked about it, then talked some more, then talked even more. We talked the subject to death, making sure we were always on the same page - and we always were! When we got engaged, we got a lot of shit about it being too soon and everyone said we wouldn't last. We remained engaged for two years before we got married and now we are very happily married.   So, don't let anyone tell you it's too soon. No one can tell if you the time is right except you and your girlfriend. So before you decide to take a step forward in your relationship, have a very serious conversation with your girlfriend, and do it only if you both decide it is the right move.
Interesting. The coin is the same on both sides, which made me think it wouldn't be legal tender, but I wasn't sure. Thanks for the information!
I still have hope that we will see LSH on the show, and let me explain why.  Did anyone watch How I Met Your Mother? While the show was still on air, fans had a theory that the mother was dead the whole time. Then in an interview the actress who played the mother debunked that theory, saying it was just a ridiculous conspiracy theory created by fans and that the mother is not dead. Guess what fucking happened on the last episode? So, the actress lied about the show's ending!  What is the moral of this story? Trust no one. People who are involved with making shows lie all the time to throw off fans. Thus, I hope they haven't officially decided to not include LSH.  Edit: Stupid autocorrect.
