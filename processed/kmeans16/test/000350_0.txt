Ultimately in a country where a shit song like [DJ waley Babu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OulN7vTDq1I) is becoming insanely popular what else can you expect? Certainly not class and intelligence.
Watch [Bakita Byaktigato](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT_fFFFtctk). I linked it to the full youtube video, and while the film is in Bengali, the video is decently subtitled. It is partly a movie about romance, though I will better characterize it as a movie about *leela*.  In my opinion, it is probably one of the best 100 films ever made in India.
Open one in Texas, and name it Jade Helm.
FEMAs Region X says, Our operating assumption is that everything west of Interstate 5 will be toast.
Didn't they call him Bekar patel?
What is the problem with a piecemeal regulation if it is good? And as regards incentive, you may be different, but in many cases people have to work extra jobs just to make ends meet. The majority of American poor are actually employed, and there are significant populations of homeless, unemployed Americans. A place to sleep, and food to eat is a basic animalistic motivation, when you make people work two to three jobs just for that - then you cannot just wave it away as   In some cases, it's money.  You are confusing **need** with **incentive**. Two very different things.  And as regards, basic income it is still a fringe idea. Not a single mainstream candidate supports it, and yet without it libertarianism is categorically destructive.
Why not Tom Corbett then?
Cool story - knew it before hand. But I hate that asshole Horus. He is a religious extremist and a fanatic, and is directly responsible for most of the filth on defence.pk
The solution is to reform archaic labor laws. India remains 138 in the ease of doing business rank. Have you ever tried opening a startup in India, and seen the paperwork involved?  Saner labor laws will create more valued startups - internet dependent companies who can push back against the Mittals and the Ambanis. And finally, the GOI has to invest in fiber optic infrastructure. Even in the US of A, the big ISPs do not care about internet infrastructure, and in fact bribe Republican legislatures to purposefully stymie improvement.  Superfast internet, like that in Chattanooga, TN is municipal broadband, built by taxpayer money, in the understanding that there exists a critical mass of startups that will be attracted and will help pay for the infrastructure investment.  Another critical aspect in India is net neutrality. Nobody gives a shit whether you, as a lone consumer care about net neutrality. You have no *aukaad*. And this is not India specific, but is present in USA too. FCC was able to enforce net neutrality, because Obama had their back, who gets big donations from Silicon Valley. And even then, the Republican Party is trying tooth and nail to repeal it - including defunding the FCC. Do you think net neutrality happened in USA because the consumers demanded it? Dream on. It happened because there are internet dependent companies whose valuations rival, and exceed AT T and Comcast, and who can outlobby the ISPs.
You just described my grad school experience till now. I have now cut back on quite a few projects, and am better at doing a cost-benefit analysis. And oh yes, I now understand fully my advisers' saying, "If your work does not lead directly to a publication, don't do it."

Smells fake. Especially, the following phrases jump out:  *lived in the woods* and *started several of my own businesses*
Calibri is a terrible, terrible font. At least use Palatino.
Coincidence: I discovered (*torrented*) this series in 2013, and watched it all at one go in December 22, 2013. I know that date so well because as soon as I finished part 1, I was so impressed by one man that I had to Google him: [Victor Sarianidi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Sarianidi).  Imagine my shock when I find out that Sarianidi passed away that day, just a few hours back.  Even more amazing was the absolute uncorruptibility of Sarianidi, who first discovered and later the Afghan museum curators who later protected with their own life the [Bactrian gold.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tillya_Tepe)
