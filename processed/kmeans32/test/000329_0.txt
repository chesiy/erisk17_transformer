144 deaths, 1,391 injuries and 8,061 device malfunctions were recorded out of a total of more than 1.7 million robotic procedures carried out between January 2000 and December 2013.

Wow, this is rather disheartening, but I'd be interested to hear I_R_C's response.  I'd like to think him above this.

Did you also Photoshop ugly on all the bridesmaids?
My only point is more attention would be given to it, not that it would magically be cured in two days.  I was agreeing with the principle behind it.
Sad, but true.  Our priorities in this world are fucked up...  :-/  EDIT: Never  mind, the downvotes of Reddit have spoken. The priorities of the world are completely in order.
Seriously.  How are we supposed to know that it's a woman if we can't see the kitchen?
