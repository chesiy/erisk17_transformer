Today's decision was NOT a "favor" to the law (nor was the first decision). Today's decision was basic statutory construction. It is not ideological (and it certainly is not in any way unusual or rare) to read statutory language in context of the entire section or statute.  In February during oral arguments for Dept. of Housing and Community Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project, Inc., Scalia said "When we look at a provision of law, we look at the entire provision of law, including later amendments...We try to make sense of the law as a whole."  In Justice Thomas's majority (and unanimous) opinion in 1997's Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., he wrote, "The plainness or ambiguity of statutory language is determined by reference to the language itself, the specific context in which that language is used, and the broader context of the statute as a whole."  There's nothing new about looking at the specific content of a statute's language and to the broader context of the statute as a whole.  As for Scalia, Thomas, and Alito's dissent in King v. Burrell, they are being intentionally disingenuous. As the Chief Justice pointed out in today's majority opinion, in Scalia's dissent (joined by Thomas and Alito) in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius (AKA the first Obamacare Supreme Court case), Scalia said that without the Federal subsidies, "the exchanges would not operate as Congress intended and may not operate at all."  We look at statutes in context. As Scalia, Thomas, and Alito noted,  the subsidies were required for the law to operate as Congress intended.
I did three searches on Reddit to make sure this wasn't already posted. :P It was such a neat story, I was surprised this was the first mention of it!
I went to Awesome Con last year and had a fantastic time at the panels, getting a few photos (with Rob Paulsen and Maurice LaMarche, Cary Elwes, and Ernie Hudson), and walking around the floor.  There are some fantastic panels this year (hearing from George Takei may well be worth the cost of admission alone. He has a compelling personal story, both as one of the first prominent out Asian-Americans, as well as as a person who grew up in a Japanese internment camp). And the voice actors reading from a movie script is not to be missed! (Last year, they read Ghostbuster scenes.)
Not sure why I've been downvoted. When I say it's unacceptable that there is still zero cell phone coverage in most tunnels, that's not based on a first-world problem sense of entitlement, that's based on the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008, a federal statute that originally required coverage in the Metro system by 2012. When that deadline went flying by, it was moved to Sept. 30, 2015. And as the linked article notes, it appears likely that this deadline will be missed too.  I don't expect perfect cell service, and since it's Metro we're talking about, I don't even expect cell service. But we're supposed to have cell service.
Thank you! :-)
Indeed. For all the complaints from anti-Israel people that Israel is an "apartheid state", Israel allows freedom of worship, including Islam. Whereas attempts at sharing sites that are holy to both Jews and Muslims is all too often met with violence from Palestinians. Hell, Ariel Sharon setting foot on the Temple Mount was claimed to be the reason for the 2nd intifada.  For that matter, Egypt just banned a Jewish festival at the tomb of Rabbi Yaakov Abuhatzeira in the Beheira province. http://www.latimes.com/world/africa/la-fg-egypt-jewish-shrine-20150118-story.html
You can't. Not without entering the litigation stage, which is something one doesn't want to do. As /u/skivian noted, its an issue with more than just allergies. In other ADA contexts, like the work or school environments,  they can make reasonable demands for documentation (with reasonable being a huge caveat there), but in the public accommodation sphere, it is difficult to ask for documentation without the request/demand itself being a violation of the ADA.
This won't prepare you for culinary school, but if you're looking for an easy, educational cookbook with recipes that are intended to be made there and now (as opposed to a multiday process), I recommend Elaine Cook's "Now You're Cooking: Everything a Beginner Needs to Know to Start Cooking Today." It's out of print, but you can get a used copy off Amazon for a penny plus the $3.99 to ship it. It's well laid out, teaches techniques, and doesn't call for fancy equipment.
An excellent question, and for Colorado, I don't know. As a theoretical matter (removing it from the sphere of jurisdictional-specific case law), I could see a potential case against both. The facility for failing to notify its employees and the police for failing to ensure participants were aware this might occur. (The odds of an unknowing person being affected by this drill seem higheven if the home warned its nurses, what about delivery people? Patients' families? Other visitors? This points to possible recklessness on the part of the police.)
The Archstone building is REALLY close to the metro. And the Pentagon City Mall is right above the metro stop, so, that's right there too (not just Macy's, Nordstroms, Apple, and all the usual mall stores, but don't forget the convenience of the food court, which includes a Panera, McDonalds, Chipotle, Subway, etc.). You'd be right across the street from Costco, CVS, CPK, Chevy's, etc., a block away is Rite Aid, World Market, Noodles   Co, a thai place, a sports bar, an Irish pub,  and one block beyond that is Harris Teeter (grocery store) and Bed, Bath, and Beyond. You'd also be in walking distance of the Aurora Hills branch of the Arlington library, which is small, but they are quick to get in books from the rest of the Arlington library system if you put in a request.  I'm not sure what iidesune is talking about-it's an easy commute with no need to switch to the Red Line. You'd take the Blue Line from Pentagon City to Farragut West. It's five stops, and would take you around 19 minutes.  Do you have any specific questions about Pentagon City I could help with?
Thanks! I guess this is the sort of thing they might have told people on October 1st, but rather than make us come in for 15 minutes just to put up away messages and stow files, etc., my boss had my team stow our files the night before and telework on the 1st for 10 minutes, so, yay for not spending more time commuting than working the 1st day of the shutdown, but we might have missed out on some last minute instructions. :P
In this political climate, I don't see how we can get retroactive pay. The constituents of those pushing us into a shutdown are hardly likely to be thrilled with their Congresspeople if they let us get paid for no work (even if the lack of being able to work was not our choice).
(Oh, and if you have any specific questions, PM me.) :-)
Well, I'm glad you posted it. I hadn't seen this one before.
Adorable! What is your sheltie's name?
Absolutely no reason to use anything extra other than bar prep course materials. The most important thing is to not panic during the exam. Read the question carefully, and respond the way a lawyer would. It is less important to remember case names or even case law than it is to respond in a clear, logical fashion.  Beyond that, I'll pass along the sage advise one of the barbri lecturers told us: every point you get above passing is wasted effort. You don't need to get 100%. You're not looking for an A. You're looking to pass. Don't lock yourself in a law library exclusively for three months. See friends. Read fiction. Go to the movies or the theater. Hell, go to a strip club. Just make sure you are balancing your time so you don't burnout studying.  Study the prep materials, practice the multiple choice questions, get a good night sleep the night before the exam, and don't panic during the exam, and you should do fine.
