No chance. I went to the last rally more so as a spectator, and the behavior on both sides of the rally was disgusting.   I saw counter protesters assaulting and spitting on people.    I also saw the reclaim Australia people screaming racial slurs and trying to intimidate people in smaller groups.   Honestly it was an embarrassment to say the least. Both sides should be ashamed of themselves. Neither were proving anything except that people are arseholes no matter what side of the argument they are on.
Nah he croaked. He was well into his 80's.   I remember my dad coming into my room laughing before he told me. Seemed fitting for the old bloke, he was a bit of a joker in his day so i'm sure he would have wanted us to see the funny side of it.
Cheers!
Go ahead! I was forced into it but i like how they turned out, the person taking the photo's got some awesome shots of him.   edit- i was forced into doing the topless shots, not the photo's in general haha
My son with my beard.
I work around the corner!
I had a fast tech delivery arrive on the 24th. God damn was I stressing haha.   I also got some juices from VE at the same time.   Sorry to hear you missed out :(
Yeah i have already lost myself to the joys and wonders of coil building.   At the moment i'm using a 30w hana clone with a lemo, and i just got an order from fast tech with all my new mechs and attys (all clones) so i spent the better part of my night playing around with them.   I'm loving my dark horse clone ontop of a nemesis. Looks and feels great
So are the concentrate's just straight flavoring or are they like a doubler?   Yeah i'v got some on order but i have to wait until after Christmas. I used the last of it yesterday so i'm not too stressed haha   merry Christmas to you too
Awesome thanks mate

Again it depends on the trade, I'm a fitter and turner working in maintenance. Im on a 12 hour rotating shift roster (days/nights). Rostered on for 12 days a month. Pretty good money (between 80k-110k depending on overtime) with plenty of time off. Can't complain.

My mum needs some help.   http://www.gofundme.com/flrd1k   This is my mum, she has not been dealt the greatest cards in life. Although she worked her arse off as a single parent working her way through university while raising 3 kids.   Her passion in life was nursing and was on her way to becoming a midwife. It was all taken away from her due to a debilitating injury at work that left her unable to go on with her career. After the accident and unavoidable surgeries that followed, she was left with a difficult battle with depression and other medical issues that really impacted negatively on her way of life.   Now because of her previous qualifications (which are now usless to her) she is unable to qualify for government funding or assistance to help pay for a course to be able to return to work and generally improve her life.   She was always worked so hard and selflessly for my siblings and I and I just want her to be able to do that. So please, if you could take a minute to have a look and help an amazing person out of a shitty situation.   Thanks
Just woke up from a 14 hour night shift. Imagination broken
What to do?   It's such a beautiful day, give me something to do. Anything at all.
I usually take my own outside micrometer set (0-100mm), depth micrometer set and vernier. All shops iv worked in have supplied them but its hard to keep track of the condition of the tools when everyone else is using them too. Also a dial indicator and base. Very easy for them to be damaged and no one says anything, potentially causing you trouble down the track.

looking for something to do tonight?
Totally worth it! You get over an hour and a half air time and a free breaky! The take off and landing are a bit tricky but at the time you don't really think about it.
obviously they have never been to dandenong
