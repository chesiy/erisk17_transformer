So I found this: http://www.uer.ca/forum_showthreads.asp?fid=1 catid=301  There look to be a bunch of interesting sites around. I would be down for exploring some and taking pics :)

So if I'm not mistaken, you guys didn't cover the boss theme from MM3 in History Repeating. Any particular reason (like, wouldn't it have fit in the albums' narrative)?

I noted in the description that I'm trying to find alternatives, like day-care or walkers. I have time outside of work to take care of it, and I understand it can't be left alone for 10 hours. So, would taking it to day-care while I'm at work be sufficient?
... good one
About to start working full time, and I want to get a dog. What breed should I get?   I'm about to start working full time in a suburban area in Washington state; I'll be living alone and out of the apartment for 9-10 hours every weekday. I want a dog for companionship though, and am willing to do the needed grooming and exercising (1-1.5 hours per day), though I don't think I'll have a fenced-in yard.  I really want a Husky. I'd likely get an adult rescue (not a puppy); would it be too demanding?  Otherwise, other breeds I'd be interested in are Mastiffs, Australian Shepards or Shiba Inus. Would any of those suit my lifestyle better?   Edit: If I were to get a dog walker to walk the dog around midday (so the dog would never be alone for more than 4 hours or so), would a Husky be out of the question?
Ooooh narrated by Robert Webb. Interesting!   Edit: So the kids keep partying and acting like entitled cunts? I guess some change is better than none... source: watched some clips
Oh, I like that idea. A bit harsh though (in that you'd need a judge); getting people to partake in the show would be tough.
Dang! Nice!
Whereat, if I may ask?
Fame? Charity?
Agreed. I don't recall saying anything to the contrary :)
I like it!
I do believe there are people trying to support families on minimum wage. Jobs are hard to come by, so people take what they can, which is typically insufficient. Also note that the minimum wage hasn't gone up with inflation over the past 30 years.
Hahaha... riiiiight
Me too, but hey, in the USA most them are millionaires at the very least. They'd be eligible to be part of the show anyway :D
I came here to post the same info. Thank you!

You've given us quite the taxing challenge. How about "Washing"? Could you afford us more characters? This really constitutes a problem...  Sorry I don't have anything better :(
