Let me rephrase I don't want to pay for an app before I know I would use it.  So say I find a 5 dollar app.  I don't want to spend the money if I decide I don't like it, which is why a trial period would be nice, or if I'm trying to determine between two similar apps.
I am trying to do a startup and have freelance SEO be my income while working on the startup so i think i will be good about the other aspects of the job.  The one concern that you bring up repeatedly is getting paid.  Do you use some system for recurring payments?
Nope I'm not, I just don't freak out about small things like op is talking about.
You get that on any region specific subreddit it's obnoxious.  Hey I'm visiting Vermont?  What should I do?  Well look at the history of the past 300 times a person has asked that and you might have a good idea.
Will OP deliver?
Hang in there little buddy, lots of fish in the sea
Id invite you to my party?
Wasn't aware of that.  With that being said should it really be required for construction zones all to have a police detail?  Will a flagger suffice?  And what about projects like road paving?  The construction company might pay for the cop, but they count that into what they charge to do the job, which would be footed by the taxpayers, right?
I was trying to come off not as a badass, just trying to frame it that I had some knowledge on how to throw a punch and defend yourself.  But everyone it appears took it as me trying to sound tough.  Oh well whatya gonna do?
This is what I'm talking about, I want employees to feel like I can trust them to get their shit done on their own and treat them like adults rather than micro manage them.
More money elsewhere, match fixing scandals, and loss of champions league spot.
Whatever we are happy with our multiple NFC championship game appearances. (Not really)
Nope hood was closed otherwise I would have.

He isn't wrong but the success of the movie greatly benefits him and his brand for future roles and comedy specials etc.  But hey do what you want.  I don't think a company should make it mandatory, but depending on what you are asking and how it could benefit you in the long term should also be taken into consideration.

I'd like to think so.

Oh you...
Then I guess I die?  Not sure, I swim with friends so hopefully they could save me.  Shit happens, can't prevent every single possible scenario that might kill me?
Agreed

1. I don't understand what you mean by how you hold it? 1. Well that is a gray area i am working out.  Sorta the same deal that is going on with Airbnb if say someone slipped on my driveway and broke my arm and sued me I could be liable.  Currently homeowners insurance in some cases will carry over to a certain amount to your possessions stored elsewhere but not the full amount.  I would probably have to offer some sort of 1 million dollar guarantee like what Airbnb does. 1. Yes, just like airbnb, this isn't for everyone but just go on craiglist and see that people are seeking places to rent and store things.  I had 4 fake craiglist posts up for different types of properties going for about a month and half.  I had about 88 e-mails inquiring about the space. 1. Again I point to Airbnb, because these things can happen in that scenario as well.  However what Airbnb has as a huge selling point is the background verification and review system that incentives people to be honest.  I am a huge airbnb host and make a lot of money doing that.  I could go in and steal my guests camera or computer and sell it for a few hundred bucks.  But I won't 1. because I am an honest person but 2. even if I wasn't I can make $2,985 max each week renting out properties.  So even if I did steal and make a couple of hundred bucks off of it, a bad review where they mentioned theft in my home could cost me way more in the long run.  I imagine the same would be true of storage and trust.

Is it ok to run any type of component cable and HDMI cable through a wall?   [Picture of the Living Room](http://i.imgur.com/vSD1AKh.jpg)  Hey Guys,  Included is a picture of my living room.  As you can see in the picture I have a tv over a fireplace.  My plan is to build built in shelves and cabinets on either side.  I'd like to hide all the electronics in one of the cabinets, and run HDMI and component cables through the wall so it looks good.   So basically what I am trying to do is put the wall plates behind the tv, and then somewhere to the left lower down that would eventually be behind a cabinet.  This way I could easily plug in stuff to the tv without having to re-run wires every time while always keeping them hidden.   So as far as I know, certain power cables need to be regulated for being placed in walls for whatever reason.  I don't plan on running any power, just HDMI and component cables.  Do they need to be a specific kind to be run in the wall?  Or will what I have purchased work for what I have planned?  I appreciate any help you can provide.  Also not sure if this is relevant but that wall is an exterior wall with insulation in it.
