Wow I didn't realize how much people didn't like that. I guess if you don't put "/s" after something blatantly not serious the hoard jumps on you.

Yeah the original was a bit spooky for me.
Your choices are wrong.
Honest question: why do people think this? I really didn't think he did very well at all in Guardians.

Guardians of the Galaxy.  Sorry. I didn't genuinely laugh once and I didn't care about anything that was happening or any of the characters. Above that, I thought it was boringly written and I thought Bautista, Saldana, and half the other characters did a cheesy job with already cheesy enough lines. I love Pratt in Parks   Rec, Cooper in everything, and I like James Gunn as a director. I was really looking forward to it. In the end, I didn't even appreciate it as a fun, cheesy, space-opera. Maybe I'm heartless. I'm guessing y'all will think I am.
I said it before, and I'll say it again. They should have gotten Mark Strong. He's an excellent actor who excels at playing an intimidating, stone-cold badass. Plus he's naturally bald, so that won't look weird.  http://1serial.tv/uploads/posts/2014-02/1393572396_7.jpg
I love how into it he is.
Might wanna NSFW this.
If you are in for a longer ride and have Netflix, watch the BBC series "Luther" starring Idris Elba. Judging by the movies listed, we have similiar taste. I promise it wont let you down. It's incredibly well acted, written, and directed, and has some amazing cases and killers. The last two episodes of season two were up there with Se7en and Prisoners. Really good stuff.
On the other hand, I met Macklemore in the NBA store in NYC two or three days ago. Dude seemed really sad and didn't say a word as I asked for a picture. Made me feel like a bit of an asshole for asking although I've been a huge fan for a while. He was all alone and looked tired as shit.
Well shit.
Same here. Here's a few I took.  http://imgur.com/a/O9etA
Holy shit. That's amazing.
As much as I love /r/thatHappened, keep it off every single Confession Bear.
