I've thought of that but it means you still have to play without throwing, right?
http://tryingtomakesenseofpeople.tumblr.com/post/113807401152/okay-what-you-dont-understand-is-that-feminism  These are being done by 'official' feminist groups (such as UN Women): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrxEnQPgouc  are you really going to sit here and tell me that they aren't real feminists too?  and I'm not trying to erase nb but men and women alone make up up to 99.7% of population...  also, MGTOW is not the counterpart to feminism, MRA is and they are 2 diff movements
she doesn't have to ult to get a kill

yes, escape velocity
because I messed up okay
oh okay I guess I am attuned to it, so that's why I am having a hard time understanding. thanks for being the most sensible here and well people talk behind other people's backs as it is. that's just how the world is. take care!
I think the first step to fixing this problem is to teach people to be logical human beings   children should be taught to (almost) always ask for sources or proof (if it's a personal matter, ask the specific person for personal information based matter)  Also teach children to be kind (do unto other as you would have them do unto you sort of morals). As for me, I just don't care (not in the sense I don't want to hear it, just more along the lines of do what you want-provided it's logical) whether another girl or guy does this or that (or not that I wouldn't support them if it seemed appropriate). I would recommend also that people focus on more important matters than trivial things, like whether this person did this or that (please be logical, if the rumor is someone fed someone else then it doesn't apply here) is not going to fix world hunger. (if you're going to argue what am I doing, myself. well I am studying hydrology because I believe having accessible drinking water is important)  ugh, if you are going to criticize me for celebrity matters, it's for entertainment (entertainment is necessary too, and as i mentioned, I like hearing people's stories, maybe they even inspire me but like okay it's not like there isn't anyone who has a new boyfriend every week other than Taylor Swift)  if I missed anything, be logical  honestly, I feel it comes down to being logical or having common sense. I know not everyone will 'be nice,' but if you're not going to do it, nobody else will.
gender is neurological/psychological, so it exists (it is not a social construct) even observable behavior patterns for each gender are real  but yea, if there is no 'defined sets of genders, there is no 'transitioning,' you can be born and well what gender are you?? we can't define it if we didn't have male or female.  people think gender roles are checklists, when i see it as more of a guideline. and it just happens, no, someone did not sit down and said, girls will like to shop and boys will prefer sports. Rather, it just happens that these trends are true.
I met a girl, in a club space. She explicitly told me she was cis (I hate that term by the way) and then a week later turned genderfluid. We don't talk anymore.  transtrenders claim that dysphoria is not necessary; they might change pronouns on a daily basis. Moreover, you can tell they're just doing it for oppression points or whatever.
she asked for advice on reddit 2 months before it happened
sona can get too boring to play really fast (not to mention the multiple nerfs, like 30) for such a huge investment; not amount of fancy particles is going to make it more enjoyable (unless they just overhaul her kit I'm talking about in-game effects, for example remove cc with her heal and what not).  also, in my opinion: might as well not give the discount since the discount is fairly meaningless.  Ezreal doesn't get boring fast (although may the skin might since all skills are blue but w/e). and Udyr certainly has dynamics.
not all champions in the other 4 roles must have some form of cc to be a decent team comp  for example, people would just go that once thresh is picked, he's all the cc they would need  and you're the one that's incompetent
something need to be done about katarina: how can people say katarina is balanced?   This is about her ult, only  here is a list of champions that CAN'T stop kat's ult:  -Akali -Caitlyn -Corki -Mundo -Eve -Ez -Fiora -Gankplank -Graves -Jinx -Karma -Karthus -Kat -Kayle -Khazix -Kog -Leblanc (since she lost silence) -Lucian -Lux -Yi -Miss Fortune -Mord -Nasus -Nidalee -Nunu -Olaf -Rengar  -Rumble -Ryze -Sivir -Swain -Talon (since he lost silence) -Teemo -Trundle (?) -Tryndamere -Twitch -Varus -Vlad -Yorick -Zed -Zilean total: 41/123  champions with UNRELIABLE cc: -Ahri -Amumu (must use bandage toss to stop her; his ult does not stop kat) -Anivia (ice ball is slow, not sure about wall) -Ashe -Brand -Cass -Elise -Fizz -Gnar (must be mega gnar to stop her) -Heimerdinger -Irelia -Kennen -Morg -Nocturne -Shaco -Shyvana -Syndra? -Twisted Fate -Viktor -Xerath -Xin? -Yasuo -Ziggs -Zyra total:24/123  a grand total of 65/123 champions that cannot be picked  conclusion: just by picking kat (some might argue akali, yi and fiora but roots do stop these champions, unlike kat), you invalidate half the champion pool. Not many of the adcs (not everyone is gonna pick ashe, vayne, tristana or quinn) can stop kat's ult and because adc is necessary, we only get to choose 4 out of 58 champions and it's not even 58 as some are not viable (for example: zac, urgot and galio) and yes she has high win rate and high banning status (especially in korea, don't know about NA): http://www.op.gg/statistics/champion/katarina/  my problem with kat, not that I lost to one, is that she is the reason you cannot just pick any champion into any role and well forces picks (mainly support since the support is required to have CC just so you can stop katarina) where as sometimes I want to support with zilean and karma, for example but cannot.
oops
I don't know any satanic music...
