c/p  Basically, I have to rely on mouz and ehome getting 1st place, rest I pretty much fucked up. Wings got through instead of HyperGloryTeam, and NA is just a big fuck up overall anyway. I doubt they'll implement anything like you suggested. (I'd be more than happy if they do)
I hope that was sarcasm. Otherwise, you are pretty fucking dumb yo
nop
That's a bit high for me, if you come around, please contact me :)
Seems like you didn't read my first comment at all. You just saw "I'm happy they scored" and that's it.   Read it again, and see what I said.   "I hope this urges Mourinho to change Drogba and mix it up a bit,"
Thanks for the trade!

If I decide to overlock it at some point, would Hyper 212 be enough? Sorry for bothering mate, thanks for answering my questions :)
How well optimised is this game?   I'm rocking AMD Athlon X4 640 3.0, 7850 1GB, and 8 gigs of RAM.   Based off that, I can run this game, but is it well optimised? I wasn't able to enter the beta and see for myself unfortunately. :/

Harry Hole - Jo Nesbo = Good way to 'start' ?   So, I'm not a frequent 'book-reader' or however you want to call it, or should I say, I "wasn't", but nowdays, I'm more into books than anything else, and even tho I didn't read books what really interests me are mystery books.   I just wanted to ask, since there are many suggestions for ones that love mystery ( like myself ) to go and read Harry Hole series, so I'm simply asking what do you guys think about it overall, what's the best book from that serial, is it smart to start from beginning ( even tho I will 100% skip first 2 books ( Bat and another one, can't remember now).  Sorry if this breaks somekind of rules, if it does, please notify me, I'll delete the thread, just wanted to see other people experience of this novel since there are some mixed feelings about it overall that I encountered.   Thanks, and cheers!
SK CandyPanda ?    Yo guys, i just watched ocelote stream, and someone send ocelote a message, about candy panda, something me gusta and spanish shit' ( no offense ), and it was something SK ad carry, me gusta ad carry, something like that.   Ocelote replied "ya veremos". If google translator doesn't lie, it says " we will see".   I really hope CandyPanda come back, cuz i think he's awesome guy, despite what happened in the past, and his disinteresting to playing with SK.   http://pokit.org/get/img/82896559a1592df86ce5d4c89c42d1bf.jpg  - top right corner  does this mean yellowstar is still "in" or what ?
