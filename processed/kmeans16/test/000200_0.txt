Would help to search things like "first project" within the sub and you'll probably find a lot of good suggestions. Would also just start googling "mini-bar project plans", things like that.   There'll probably be a contingent of peeps telling you that this is too ambitious and that you should start with something simple like a box or table. Personally I think diving straight in to what you want to make can be an incredible learning experience, regardless of the obstacles and mistakes you'll make.
Talk about what you feel like talking about and ignore the inner monologue that keeps questioning whether what you're discussing is "interesting" or "compelling". Once you start naturally talking about things, even if it's just an instinctual undeveloped opinion, it will sounds interesting because you'll have even somewhat of a passion behind it. Short version: Don't think, just talk.
During the day, and all I need is power/wifi. I was specifically referring to places within New York City, so while the poolside resort sounds appealing I don't think its a realistic option.
Yeah definitely don't take 2.  Couple more piece of advice: Do some exercising tonight/tomorrow morning. And meditate tonight/tomorrow morning. If it's something you don't normally do, check out r/meditation or google it for some quick tips, dosn't take more than 10 minutes and will help tremendously.
Appreciate such a comprehensive response!  You are correct in identifying them as Stafford loans(4/6 of them are anyway).  To your questions:  1) I do not have an emergency savings. I just started building it up a couple weeks ago, opened a savings account and designated auto-deposits.   2) About 5% of my monthly income.  3) Stable as it can get. Catastrophe a la financial crisis is really the only scenario I see losing it, but let's be honest that could happen at any moment these days.  Sounds like the best strategy is to allocate all of my extra $ (my  goal is for 50% of monthly income) towards emergency fund and loan payoff. Having the mindset of paying off the loans being the equivalent of a 6.8% ROI is the best way for me to rationalize it.  Thanks!
Oh dear
From what I've read the issue is more with the Angels manager who isn't so much interested in playing the most offensive capable catcher. It makes sense, but bad news for Carlos. That being said I'm unaware how talented he is as far as calling a good game.  EDIT: spelling
Awesome! Thank you for this.
Yeah I'd say Russell is probably the best bet out of the bunch. I'm not as high as other people are on him. Might be worth seeing the solid ss/2b that are struggling and try to buy low on one in a trade. If you're in an espn/yahoo league, Alex Guerrero has 2B eligibility and I think he's worth starting despite his limited at bats(the moment someone get injured in that lineup, and someone will, they'll work him into it every day)
Then we're like-minded individuals. The name still carries cache though and there's plenty of ignorant owners that would deal for him thinking he's a good buy-low.
I'm starting him. And honestly expecting him to get lit up. At the end of the day it's a game and it's worth tossing the dice on guys you believe in. That's my rationalization anyway
As much as I love segura this year I think you may be jumping the gun. Didn't Andrus have a homerun and steal last night?
He got very lucky last year. Look him up on fangraphs there's a good amount of material on how his peripherals screamed regression for this year. Still a good player, just probably won't repeat last years effectiveness. I'd try to deal him to someone looking to buy low.  EDIT: I still think he's better than the waiver wire fellas you mentioned
By balls to the wall do you mean the 31st ranked defense in the league that year? Perry would have been fired if we didn't make the playoffs. The only reason the D came together in the playoffs is from leaders like Antrel Rolle and Justin tuck stepping up and rallying it together as a unit. We were the first playoff team that had more point against than points forward during the regular season. Eli literally had to bail us out in the 4th quarter of almost every game that year, which is what made it so exciting. But our defense was atrocious and Perry doesn't deserve that ring.
That's awesome- congrats
I just finished "Stranger in a Strange Land". A popular science fiction novel from the sixties, this delves into a deep examination of what we value in a western culture, particularly in regards to religion and sexuality.  More importantly, this book is funny. There's humor enriched in all the pages, and makes reading it a genuinely enjoyable experience.   After reading intense and complicated sci-fi, I chose this as a light option. I ended doing a serious examination about what my values are how people view things in western (especially American) society.  I'd suggest looking up some of the tremendous quotes from this book on a site like Goodreads, see if you find any intriguing, you may want to pick it up.
