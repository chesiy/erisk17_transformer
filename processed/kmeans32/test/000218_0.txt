Not clothes, bathing suits, swim trunks, speedos,  Yeah, sorry, that was a bit unclear. I didn't mean shirts and pants, but articles like swimming trunks. It's just that the notion of wearing *anything* in the shower is foreign to me. But I guess it's mostly habit. So how do you wash your naughty bits? Just pop 'em out real quick? I'd imagine you'd have to find some way to do it, since showering without washing your ass/genitals would sort of defeat the point, no?    High schoolers don't shower after gym class  I don't mean to be a dick, but... Ew.
Which two actors's on-screen chemistry do you enjoy the most?
Incest.
If you read the article you'd understand the use of the word 'loser'. They're literally (in its proper use) losers.  EDIT:  Your comment below this seems to have been deleted, so I'll add my reply to it here:  I had this page open for quite some time before posting, thus your edits weren't visible for me when I posted, apologies.   Let me address your points now:  It just says "players that tended to do poorly were insulting women more." Okay, there's a good chance they were insulting men more too.  I'll quote directly from the study:  While playing with male teammates, men generally follow rules associated with navigating hierarchies. Skill did not moderate focal player positivity towards a male-voiced teammate, but higher skilled individuals were less negative. **In addition, when performing poorly, players increased the number of positive and neutral statements** (Table 1), **and were generally less negative towards a male-voiced teammate**(Fig 3). As decreased cooperation or behaviours that lead to failure are often punished by teammates [35,36], the increase of positive and neutral statements and relatively less-frequent use of negative statements **suggests poor-performing, lower-skilled males are demonstrating submissive behaviour towards a male-voiced teammate.**  Males behaved in the opposite manner when playing with a female-voiced teammate. Overall, the female-voiced manipulation experienced a greater frequency of negative comments, but female-directed negativity decreased as focal-player performance improved (Fig 3). **In addition, focal-player skill further moderated player behaviour with the lowest-skilled males behaving less positively towards a female voice.** Focal players also increased the use of positive statements as their skill increased (Figs 1   2). Taken together, these results suggest that it is lower-skilled poorer-performing males that are significantly more hostile towards females, and higher-skilled focal players are more supportive.  No, players that performed poorly were not insulting to their male team mates, quite the opposite: their comments towards their male team mates became more positive.   Females on Xbox seem like an easy target, as do little kids.  Well, the point of the study was that aggression increased towards (apparently) female gamers who were doing better than them. While I don't disagree with your statement that females are often seen as "easy targets" in the world of online gaming, this specific phenomenon seems to have more to do with the fact that these gamers couldn't handle it when they were outperformed by women, when at the same time they weren't behaving aggressively towards men who outperformed them.
Lisa Kudrow delivered all of her lines beautifully. Her brick joke was fantastic!
On what issue have you completely changed your mind?
I wonder...
Break to love? Damn!
Wow. Just... wow. One of the strongest performances I've ever seen from any player!
Here's my prediction: Federer gets the first two sets, Murray the third, Federer wins it in the 4th set tie break.   EDIT: So far, so good. 1-0 Federer  EDIT 2: We're still on course! 2-0 Federer  EDIT 3: Federer was in a hurry. No 4th set tiebreak.
But what happened to the princess???
Wow, Djokovic basically broke his own serve just now...
Cheers!
Ain't 'allegedly' just the best word?
After that insane start Rafa seemed to get a nice handle on Brown's game in the second set and I turned to my friends and said, shaking my head: "Well, it was fun for a second but now Rafa's figured him out. He'll destroy him in 4 without much sweat."  I humbly retract my statement. Never have I been so glad to be wrong. What a game!
Thanks!  /u/sembello: rebuttal?
Don't count on it. Even if the technological progress allows for longevity, there is no such thing as "forever" in a decaying universe.  So even if science figured out how to stop all mechanisms of aging in the next few decades )(color me sceptic), all you could possibly hope for is to live a very, very, very, very, very long life.
And there one is! Amazing!  It took me less than 10 seconds to find this in your comment history:   Nevermind the fact that the current state of the USA has it that by default men are not US citizens unless they sign up for the draft. Women got all the rights and none of the associated responsibilities, and thats just the way these poisonous little radical fucktards like it.  That's a pretty neat magic trick, /u/kgtx!
The Van is labelled in German though.
Following the woman up to her room after you've already said your goodbyes at the bar doesn't strike me as a particularly good thing. It's misguided at best, creepy at worst.  If by the "good thing" he did you mean that that he didn't try to force her into anything after being rejected, then your bar for goodness is pretty darn low. I'd call that the basest of human decencies.   Regarding "OP is a scumbag wife": OP made it obvious that they're both married. So him trying to get some strange isn't scummy?  As for a partner having drinks with a stranger of the opposite sex, I guess that comes down to what you and your partner have agreed to. I've never found it troubling in my relationships, but I can understand why some couples put it on the "No-No" list.
I think that would be a good idea.
Nope.   But as Pager Western showed in an extensive study in 2009, black felons were at least as likely, if not more likely, to be hired than white men with the same qualifications who didn't go to prison. [^^Source] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2915472/)  Or let's look another fun study that shows that the infant mortality rate of non-hispanic whites is more than double the rate of blacks.[^^source](http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6205a6.htm)  Wait. Shit. I got mixed up, it's the other way 'round.
Wanna bet?
If you have a beard your mileage may vary on that one.
Except gay people can have healthy, fulfilling relationships as consenting adults.
Thank you for this comment!  I've been lurking in this sub for the past few days and your comment was the most helpful I've seen so far! Like OP I've wasted weight on unnecessary junk (which prompted the use of more boosters, which led to a spiral of clutter). I just tested a more minimalist design with great success. Thank you!
You can resign from the council. Voila!
So, wait, you *didn't* buy it?!
I... what?
Wow, talk about petty...
I do understand the sentiment even though I suspect it's a bit hypocritical. I doubt that out of all of the mods over at /r/gameofthrones, none has watched the leaked episodes... Well, it's a moot point.  I guess there's just one thing to do: **Whenever you see anyone over in /r/gameofthrones (or any other sub) ask about a place to discuss the leaked episodes, send them a PM to inform them of this subreddit.**   That way only people overtly looking for a discussion are told of this place and the mods over at /r/gameofthrones can rest assured that this sub is only "advertised" to people who want to take part in the discussion.
It's been so very long since I read the books so I'd appreciate it if someone could refresh my memory:  Is that how Mance dies in the books? This scene seemed very unfamiliar to me. Also, it seems like they completely changed Tyrion's story line or am I remembering that wrong? Was Varys with him in the books?
