It was on my evening commute back from class at SF State to my house in Portola Valley - so it was dark and way after the rush hour commute - probably around 10 PM.  The commute was great. 3 or 4 lanes the whole way and almost no traffic. I would fly down 280 with music blaring (I build speakers into my helmet) then hit the hot tub as soon as I got home.   I got several tickets - - one more point and I would have lost my license. C'est La Vie.
The World to Hillary   Huffington Post: [Bernie Sanders and a lot of unlikely allies are backing up Jeb Bush about part-time workers](http://www.businessinsider.com/bernie-sanders-jeb-bush-conservatives-2015-7) (Source: Business Insider)  "If he is talking about the need for more full-time jobs than part time jobs, that's absolutely correct," Sanders said.  The flap came after Bush proposed increasing economic output by increasing worker participation, helping part-time workers get full-time work and helping Americans who have dropped out of the workforce find jobs. Democrats have tried to use the comments  Bush said growing the economy would require Americans to "work more hours"  to say he's "out of touch."
Would like to hear from mechanics/shop owners, but I seriously doubt it.  Can you imagine a mechanic EVER having to tell a customer:  "Yes I know the problem only occurs when cornering quickly, but I can't test it in my 'agreed with the insurance company' route"  "Only occurs over larges bumps - no I can't test that"  "On steep grades? Sorry mate - not allowed by my insurer."
This 20s movie as you put it was made in 1948 and starred Humphrey Bogart.  It has an IMDB rating of 8.3, and a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 100%/critics   93%/audience.   It is #34 on Rotten Tomatoes list of the [Top 100 movies of all time]( http://www.rottentomatoes.com/top/bestofrt/)  So yes, a paraphrased quote was used in a 40+ year old movie (Blazing Saddles). It was also used many, many other times.
On business travel - Gin   Tonic.  If I'm just with colleagues, I get it full strength.  If I'm with clients, I have the bartender just float a little gin on top. It tastes like a gin   tonic, no one can tell that it isn't full strength, and I can keep them coming all night without getting wasted.
I hope you take this in the spirit it is meant. While my ex was the one that was very disrespectful within our relationship (see my other post in this thread) I had difficulties with her beliefs as well.  To sum it up, the majority of Christians have a belief in an afterlife that is conditional on your behavior (yes, I've really oversimplified, but please go with me on this).   It can be very difficult to see the person you love most as being on a path that does not lead to the afterlife that you believe in. So, while a Christian may initially say they are OK with you being an atheist, be aware - - belief is a powerful force, and as time goes on, it can really mess with how one sees their partner.
Everybody that just left Reddit please raise your hands.  No? I didn't think so. Based on all the complaints, I don't see much of an "exodus".
I believe that Victoria facilitated several AMA on issues related to current events. Perhaps she can shed some light on this issue.

It's just a flesh wound. ... Right, I'll do you for that!
Legal experts said they're often surprised that people who comment online, even younger Internet users who've grown up online, seem to believe they're protected.  "In my experience with speaking with groups, and even speaking with some students, they seem to believe they will be protected when they speak on the Internet because they choose to use some fictitious name," Tulane University law professor Amy Gajda said.  Illinois' opinion was based in large part on a pair of earlier, lower-court decisions in the state, which held that the anonymity of someone who makes comments in response to online news stories isn't guaranteed if their opinions are potentially defamatory, according to Don Craven, an attorney for the Illinois Press Association.  "It's not that you get to say whatever the heck you want to say and you're going remain anonymous," Craven said.
We're at a party, sitting on a couch talking, and I'm concentrating on what I'm saying, sort of looking off in the distance while I'm talking and WHAM . . . "why are you looking at her? who is she? why are you flirting with her?"  What a psycho bitch . . . so yah, I married her and it took me 15 years to figure out it was a bad idea. Doh!
And if you load it up with ALL the veggies (and skip the mayo) it's a pretty healthy meal.
When post-Cold War Ukraine gained independence, it held the worlds third-largest stockpile of nuclear weapons. Rather than use nukes for protection, Ukraine sought and received assurances from the international community that its borders would be respected if it gave up its nuclear weapons. In 1994, the U.S., United Kingdom and Russia signed the Budapest Memorandum, in which **all sides pledged to respect Ukraines territorial integrity, refrain from using military force or economic pressure to limit Ukrainian sovereignty and provide assistance to Ukraine if it became the victim of aggression from another nation.**   Obviously, Russia has broken its part of that agreement. Now the question is whether the US will break theirs.   **If the U.S. breaks their word, they should consider the devastating impact on American counter proliferation efforts around the world**. How could any nation ever trust U.S. security assurances if they see, in the carnage and destruction in Ukraine, **the deadly folly of trading nuclear weapons for American guarantees**?
