This a thousand times I am editing videos of all the candidates for a website at work right now and every time I watch trump I cringe at how extreme he is. The far right loves him but moderates and independents won't touch him. I would bet Jeb will get the nomination and take Jindal as his running mate.
I started playing a few months ago, and can already play a few songs . it is my first instrument and while it is challenging I am able to teach myself with the help of the internet and a couple books. I am not sure I could say the same for other instruments. I picked the ukulele because it seemed fun, I liked the sound ,and I liked the idea of traveling with it. I get what your saying that billing it as easy may discourage new players when it requires practice and patience like any other instrument, but people who do things just because they are easy typically don't make it too far in any endeavor.
Thanks I will give it a try!
Hey fellow Charleston vegan couple of places to check out delz up town,  black bean co, co Asian restauraunt, octobachi, fig and Macintosh have great veggie plates and butcher and bee mez plate is great too. Let me know if you have any questions .
I went to an eating disorder clinic many years ago not as a vegan but as a vegetarian. When I checked in I was allowed to list 3 things I wouldn't eat I chose chicken beef and pork (I figured they wouldn't serve much fish and I was right) after three days of complying with the menu they gave me I was allowed to  choose the foods I wanted as long as they met my dietary requirements so I actually never ate meat while I was there had yoghurt a couple times and eggs once when I didn't get to choose. I hope this helps put you at ease a bit . I have been in recovery for 6 years its a hard battle but I am much happier now than I was back then. If you want to talk inbox me.
It was kind of a kink themed club

There was an episode of sex in the city where Carrie had a bi boyfriend he was portrayed realistically and in a positive way. But Carrie couldn't handle dating a bisexual and left him at a party with no explanation ( wtf )
We had a first year teacher this year with 4 preps and no prior education experience. I think he had a degree is bussiness and was teaching marketing type classes. He quit 6 weeks in he didn't realized what teaching would be like and   he didn't have the skills or support to push through it. It isn't for everyone, that guy was a smart, good guy who will be great at someone's company he just wasn't meant to be a teacher. The same way that I would probably crash and burn at a marketing firm. What others have said is helpful too take a day off ask for help, see what is on teachers pay teachers on days when you are overwhelmed with planning. It gets easier , but if you don't like it and it,s making your life miserable then getting a routine down isn't going to make you love it all of the sudden. Best of luck whatever you decide to do.

It depends on the level of the students. If they are higher level you may be able to use reading like a historian. http://sheg.stanford.edu/rlh I typically use a non primary source to give them an idea of what we are talking about and then give then a primary source document. We break it down as a class after each paragraph we talk about how we would say it. Sometimes I have them do a # that would follow it if it were on twitter to check for understanding. For the Gettysburg Address I break the speech up into sections and have groups re-write it on the white board. For my students primary source work is all bout understanding so anyway we can break it down is huge. You may also be able to use some mini DBQs they have step by step instructions on how to use documents to create an outline and eventually write a argumentative essay. Hope that helps good luck on your first year.
I loved psyc, but I got out of college and I was bar tending to make ends meet, I had planned to go to grad school and become a counselor but I wanted to take some time off. Part of being a bartender is talking to people listening to problems I was good at it but I was exhausted by it (I am sure that the 12 hour shifts didn't help) and you can't really offer any real solutions, you can just listen .I figured I needed get a better feel for if I wanted to be a counselor, I started working for a crisis hotline that too left me feeling burnt out. I went a head and applied to grad school , a few psyc programs and a couple education programs . I got into a few schools and I decided to go with education , I had a real tough time when I was in middle and high school , and it would have been much worse if it wasn't for a few out standing teachers. I felt this was a way for me to help people , that was sustainable for me. I love my job , it is very challenging, and time consuming, but I wouldn't trade it for the world.
Are you kidding me I encourage my seniors to become welders, or go into construction, if they know they dont want to go to traditional college, the military and police academy always come up for options too. Teachers need to realize not everyone wants to go to college not everyone needs too. Sorry your teacher said that welding is a great career.
I was a bartender for a long time , so I've hear pretty much everything but a guy came in one night kept ordering whiskey on the rocks, and then he ordered a red headed slut, I brought him the shot. then he said "I wasn't talking about the shot I was talking about you" and put 200$ down on the bar, and his hotel key. (I guess I should mention I am strawberry blond) Still grosses me out to think about it.
1 It will seem really overrated in the beginning.  2.Do it with someone you love the first time and there is a good chance you wont regret it. 3.Once you start having sex there is no going back.  4. Don't let anyone pressure you into it, it is your choice how you use your body and who you use it with (this doesn't just go for your first time it goes for every time)
Well you can make the argument that he wasn't the first president, because we declared independence in 1776 and Washington didn't take office until 1789, so there was a 15 year period where other people ran the country. these men (all 8 of them) were presidents of congress because the position of president of the executive branch wasn't created until the Constitution was written. source http://www.fourwinds10.net/siterun_data/government/us_constitution/news.php?q=1244133512
