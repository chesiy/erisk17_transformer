Nope, I'm being dead serias.
YES! I do the exact same thing. I've been off the butts since September 2013, but I still do the 'keys, wallet, phone, smokes' thigh slaps when I'm out the door.
I'm going to chime in, because technically I'm allowed.  I was born in the U.S back in 87' but I've been living in Australia the majority of my life.   I actually kinda wish I was over there with you guys, getting into the celebration. While I see myself as an Aussie through and through, I do kinda still feel some sort of connection to the states.  Luckily for me I have dual citizenship, so if I wanted to, I could live with you doods :)
I think Reynolds is a good actor that has a bad agent.  I was going to make a post, but you summed up all I was really going to say. The above line is my main point.  I have a bit of a man crush on Ryan Reynolds and he truely seems like a hilarious person outside of acting. But he hasn't chosen his movies well **at all**.  The only dramatic role I appreciated him in was Smokin Aces and that's not really saying much.  The dude really needed to get a role with this season of True Detective of something. Go back and do some more hefty dramatic roles.
My last relationship started like this. I got a FB message from a friend asking if I was single and if I were interested in a cool chick he knew. I was curious so I said yes.   We chatted on Facebook for a bit and hit it off. Dated for almost a year, it was quite nice actually.  I'd almost rather meeting girls via friends. That way you can get someone you know and trust to vouch both to me and the other person.  Helps weed out the crazies too :D
I get that, to a degree. It's healthy to have apprehension towards foods that's you know are high in calories. It can however be ok to have a little bit of those types of foods every now and again.  I remember feeling a moment of sadness when I saw how many calories were in a short stack of pancakes with ice cream and maple syrup. It had been years since I've had that, but it all hit me that I won't be eating that stuff for a while.  I guess you don't know what you've got till it's gone.
Fuckin' blowy-upery thingo
Me! I'm happy :)  Honestly, I am. I'm at such a stable part of my life. 27, almost saved enough for a house, my career is solid and I have a permanent job doing what I love.   There were only two things which were actively bothering me. One was my weight and the other was finding myself a lady. These two issues tend to go hand in hand.  I've been working on my weight for the past 3 months, I'm down 16 kgs and I'm working on my fitness.  In a little bit, ill go back into the dating scene with some confidence and find me a lady :)  Please don't respond by saying "finding a girl won't make you happy, blah blah". I am happy, but I would be happier in a relationship. I left my last relationship a while ago because I wanted to be single to focus on my career. I'm done with that, I want to settle down.
I'm down 35 lbs as of this morning, I'm in the same boat - but I've only really had one person notice my efforts.   The thing is that I had a huge amount of weight to lose (started at 285) so much of the weight I have lost is likely visceral fat which obviously doesn't show on the outside. I'm down 3 belt buckles and 2 shirt sizes though :)   but I'm already starting to feel better  This is the main point, I feel amazing. I get solid sleep every night. I don't sweat as much anymore and aside from some hunger (extremely manageable) I have all the energy in the world.
A clever play on words. I don't care how tasteless the context is or who recites it. I will laugh and I will probably hate myself for doing so.
The real question is, what order?   Also FYI, */r/thosearetheheartandsoulofreddit* doesn't exist :(

I've not seen it yet (doing so tomorrow), but this the the one thing I care about. It can suck, it can be boring, but it better not try to reinvent the wheel. The movie could be made with minimal reference to the show, but the main aspects of the show need to be in the movie. Brotherhood, growing up and defining yourself.  It's currently 32% on rotten tomatoes, but from what I read, those who're fans of the show enjoyed it.
(Spoilers All) Why I'm not fully worried about the TV shows omission of a certain Lady.   Hey guys,  I was as shocked and annoyed as all of you when S4 ended without an awesome scene where Merrit Frey gets killed and there is the big Lady Stoneheart reveal. But I'm not yet worried about her character being completely cut from the show, I think most of this talk about her perhaps not being introduced is bullshit and misdirection by D D and Co.  If you look at the books, apart from her reveal at the end of ASOS she doesn't appear until well into AFFC when Brienne encounters her. Since S5 looks to be putting the focus on Dorne rather than the Riverlands, it is perfectly reasonable to think that she may be introduced later on in the season. They can't just have the Brotherhood disappear without and further information.   What do you think? Are you as optimistic as me?  **TL:DR - I'm not yet convinced that Lady Stoneheart has been cut completely yet (no pun intended). I think she will be revealed towards the back end of season 5.**
Our D D 5e experience with LMoP so far! Session 4 (Spoilers LMoP)   Here is the 4th session of our LMoP campaign! Its been a real blast so far and this one was the conclusion of the Redbrand Ruffian hideout. To read the [3rd part click here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/2f505e/our_dd_5e_experience_with_lmop_so_far_session_3/). Links to the previous sessions are in each thread.  Here is our current roster for this session:  - Human bow fighter   - Tiefling sorcerer  - Dragonborn barbarian  - Pirate themed tanky fighter  - Dwarf control wizard (Player away this week)  - Human GWF fighter  We pick up where we left off in session 3, we've just killed the giant penis monster (nothic) and we've discovered a magic invisible wall! We heal our wounded players and head out. The bow fighter asks that the fighter go first with him behind him, they pass through the invisible wall. and cautiously walk down the hallway, the fighter hears some movement in the room and decides to bust down the door. He sees a man in wizards robes writing away on some parchment with a glass staff next to him... Wait a minute, we're looking for a bad guy called *Glass Staff* **DUN DUN DUNNNNNNNNNN**. The shoe drops and the fighter points his sword at the wizard "stop what you're doing, you're under arrest" the wizard stands up, smiles and says a magical word. He casts charm on the fighter, the fighter fails his wis saving throw miserably. He is now convinced that this wizard is his best friend. The bow fighter fires an arrow at the wizard, he hits and does some damage. everyone else piles into the room. The fighter yells "Dont hit my friend" and charges at the bow fighter, grappling him successfully to the ground. The pirate charges at the wizard and does some damage and the other two do some damage to him as well. I should note that the DM upped the HP of the Glass Staff to around 80 HP because he had a feeling he would die too easily.   After that first round of combat, it comes around to the bow fighters turn, he tries to break  the grapple and fails. In the fighters turn, he faces his attention to the pirate wailing on his new buddy wizard. He tries to crash tackle into him, rolls very poorly and ends up smacking his face into the side of the bed, hes knocked out for a turn. The wizard opens a door behind him and disengages through it past 3 of his friends in the next room. Everyone piles in and charges the ruffians. They're taken care off easily. The wizard backs into a corner and falls to his knees in submission "Ill tell you everything, please don't hurt me!". What a pussy. The wizard explains that he is just an agent of another called The Black Spider, a drow. He is at the echo wave cave, there are only two more rooms left in the hideout and there are several bugbears, one of them knows the location of the black spider. Jesus, we didn't even have to torture this guy. The fighter starts going through his quarters and finds some cool shit, brings it back to the group. He is kind of ashamed of his behavior and appologises to the group.  They tie up the wizard and gag him, you going to jail. They decide to have a short rest since that wizard did a number on everyone. around 40 minutes into their rest the door gets bashed down. Oh o. This is all very small quarters fighting, the ruffians come through the door one at a time, this is tricky shit. After the first one dies, it opens up a gap to get into the other room. The sorcerer tries to cast again, wild magic kicks in... He rolls confusion. What a cock head. All players within 10 feet need to roll d10 in their turn to see what they do. Everyone affected either does nothing or is unaffected. It comes to the fighters turn. He rolls a 1. That means that he runs full distance in a randomised direction. Roll a d8, 1 or 2 and he runs at the other room. Rolls another 1. He sprints full speed past 3 ruffians and a bugbeag, they all get opportunity attacks. The fighter gets reasonably lucky and only ends up being brought down to 0 HP. Fuck this sorcerer man. Hes knocked unconscious. Thats right, a few hours in and this fighter has done nothing helpful lol.  The rest of the team is able to kill the remaining Ruffians and are able to lap around the side of the bugbear. With advantage they're able to bring the fucker down without any further deaths. The experience is given. BOOM!. Level up. Everyone is back to full hit points. Lucky for that, the fighter is hurting like a bitch. They all prepare themselves, they know there is another 2 bugbears in the other room. FOR SPARTA. With some clever positioning the team is able to position it so the bug bears get disadvantage in their opening round, and combined with a decent surprise round, we're able to take down the last two bugbears without any deaths :D  The bigger bugbear appears to still be alive, the fighter and the bow fighter try to interogate him, they fail miserably. The Barb says "Dont do it like that" he approaches the bugbear and says "If you don't tell us what we want to know, ill start cutting body parts off, you're not dead yet" after rolling a natural 20 on his intimidation check, the bugbear tells us everything about the Black Spider including where he is and where Cragmaw castle is.   That was it, we returned the wizard to the town leader for prison transfer. Overall we had a great time, I was playing the fighter and I was having fun even though I ended up doing fuck all due to some funny circumstances lol.  Sadly it was a shorter session, but what ever. Still awesome.  We're taking this next week off, but Ill try to post the 5th session when it occurs :)  Too be continued....
Enough with the damn drama.   Hi everyone, I would like to preface this by explaining that this post is only directed to those who perpituated the bullshit drama over the past few days.  I am sick and tired of this crap over the past few days. Why are you all still harping on about this. There is so much heresay, unfounded rumors and flat out lies being told by the public that I am starting to really feel sorry for everyone involved. This whole thing started with a few isolated incidents with sG and has now evolved into a retarded episode of Jerry Springer.  Whether you dislike swindle, khezu, tralf, PPD or ANYONE involved in this matter is irrelevant. Do you know what is relevant?  ITS NONE OF YOUR DAMN BUSINESS, if this was never aired publicly it would of been sorted out quickly and without all of this high school gossip rubbish. To those involved who intentionally spread bullshit to incite drama, you are not better than TMZ. You should all be ashamed of yourselves.
