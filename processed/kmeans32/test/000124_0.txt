Well it's obviously not your hardware, You're actually on better specs than I am for the most part. What I found was cranking it all down and making it the only program I was running. The slowly turning it up.
The Acrolith   Part 2: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3dzlvu/the_acrolith_part_2/   Countless google searches have brought me here to this forum. Never used reddit before, but I guess this is where people who have had experiences like myself accumulate. Ive never had to fear for my life before, despite my line of work and I dont know what to do. Running seems pointless due to my situation and the police are of no use. I dont feel in control of my own existance anymore. I feel like I'm going to be ripped apart.  Ive worked at the Moss Hill Institute for the criminally insane for just over 2 years now. I never went to college. But when you 66, 230 lbs, and own a security guard license; its easy enough to be hired as a guard. I used to enjoy guarding, its stressful, but rewarding work. But this is NOT what guarding should involve. I should never have been put anywhere near something like that without knowing about it. I swear if I make it out of this Im suing anyone I can. Fuck Moss Hill. I wish I never worked there.   Well, I didnt always work there I used to work as a bouncer at a nightclub two towns over. When I heard about security work only about 20 minutes away, I was so deeply relieved. A job that didnt require 2 hours of driving every morning and every night. And an even better perk than a short drive was the fact that I got to work in the security room , monitoring the CCTV screens. easy-peasy. I had landed the job I was going to ride with all the way to retirement. Little did I know about the one person that would make that job hell. Rufus Baker.  Rufus Baker was not my angry boss. Nor my shitty co-worker. Rufus Baker was a patient in our mental hospital. I had heard his name at least 10 times on my first day. He was a high-profile patient kept in restraints at all times. Though no one really knew why. He had been there since he was a young adult. His origins were unknown. But we knew asking questions about Rufus was an easy way to get fired (That was in fact the reason for my position being open). He was a very thin, light skinned with thin grey hair. But, the most definitive feature of Rufus was his stoney grey eyes.  Rufus seldom stirred. And is he did stir it was to stare at a different part of his pale blue room. He looked at the wall as if he could see straight through them, to all corners of the building. When switching through the screens, I always seemed to come back to Rufus. He was our only patient kept in high security at all times, but in comparison to some of the other patients, he was completely harmless. Twice a day two people would come in and feed him and a Doctor would look at him and a little screen next to his bed, then write stuff on his clipboard and leave. Watching him was completely mundane and boring, but I couldnt stop. I had always been into mystery novels and the horror genre. So trying to figure him and some of the other interesting patients out was a lot of fun for me.   Things began to change when I had done a routine check of all the cameras and went back to Rufus to see if he had changed positions. He had not. Bored with the cams I decided to try and draw Rufus (Im no artist, but doodling kills time). I pulled out my sticky notes and drowsily reached for a ball point pen to my right. I tried to pinch it between my fingers, but I realized there was no pen to grab. It was now about 5 inches from where I had originally saw it. Puzzled, I grasped at the pen again, it then skittered like a bug across the entire width of my desk, and fell down between the frame and the wall. I sat there for who knows how long in complete awe. I looked around for any sources to the pens movement, but found nothing. To make it even worse I couldnt reach the pen now because the desk was built into the floor. 	 I sat back down and laughed it off. I opened my desk and reached for a new box of pens and popped it open. Luckily these put up no fight I turned towards my sticky notes and scrawled on the top one was  ***DONT*** . Similarly to the pen incident, I searched for a source to the note, and found nothing. Due to my usual choice of media, I have a tendency to jump to conclusions and freak myself out. I calmed my senses and began to think rationally. This was a prank, it had to be. I shook it off thinking I would discover the source later.  And I did discover the source, but sooner rather than later. On screen was Rufus, looking straight at me. I felt shivers run down my spine and goose bump crawl down my arms. I got up and swiftly backed away from the screen. His stony eyes followed me the whole time as if we were in the same room. Very unsure of the situation, I fled the room to take a much needed coffee break. I had to clear my head, and get away from the screens. I thought it couldnt have been real, I was just sleep deprived. Or maybe I had too much to drink the day before? When I returned, I didnt switch back to rufus for the rest of the evening.  I was nervous to go to work the next morning. I actually had the phone in my hand at one point to call in sick, but I was also excited that something was finally happening with rufus. I finally felt like I was in a mystery novel. Ive spent my entire time at Moss Hill trying to figure Rufus out, and now I was starting to know why. But when I got to work I didnt even look at Rufuss cam until 4 hours in. And when I did he was just sitting there, as usual, like a statue. I was deeply discouraged, But something caught my eye, in the corner of his cell, were a pile of pens. My pens. All of my Pens were gone! I promptly got up, and let my boss know I was going home sick.  I didnt return to work for a few days. I instead used my time to try and figure out what to do about the whole situation Being a very superstitious person. I decided that it was most likely safer find a job as a mall cop, but I would regret dropping it for the rest of my life. So I did some research, and it came down to either I was crazy, or he had some form of telekinetic power. And he must not want his image recorded, at least on paper (I assumed this because he seemed to leave the video recordings alone). I wouldnt resort to telling my superiors about this yet, because when people get involved with him, usually results in their termination.  I brought a new pack of pens with me and an old polaroid camera, to test my theory of him not wanting to be on paper. I didnt let my bag containing my pens and camera out of my sight until I was ready to try it. I tried the pens first. I got a hold of them fine, they put up no fight. I started to circle back to my assumption that I was crazy until I discovered that I couldn't get a drop of ink out of any of them. This surprisingly made me excited. I reached down for the camera with shaky hands. As I aimed the viewfinder at the screen I saw Rufus slowly crane his neck in my direction (Or at least the direction of the camera in his cell). My heart was now beating like bass drum. I snapped the picture.  Almost instantly Rufus did something I don't think anyone has ever seen him do. He stood up. Not like how you think someone who has spent their life in bed would stand up either. He stood up swiftly in a single motion, pulling through his restraints like they were fashioned out of pipe cleaners and paper mache. All lights in the building began to flicker and dim. The building seemed to shake. Not shake like earthquake style, but like jiggling jello. It was like all of reality seemed to tremble. Everyone on the CCTVs seemed to react too. A deep voice rang in my head and shook my body to its core. ***I AM THE ACROLITH. BEFORE THERE WAS LIFE THERE WAS STONE. BEFORE THERE WAS STONE THERE WAS ME*** He jutted his arm out to the side in a violent manner, his stony eyes seemed to emit a deep, grey light. On one of the cams I saw something that straight out of a nightmare. A patient in the cafeteria began to grab at his torso like he had a bomb inside of him. Suddenly a giant, malformed, stone and wooden arm burst from his chest cavity.  The arm fluently grabbed another patient and threw him at a group of tables with incredible force. The poor man with the abomination jutting out of his chest collapsed to the ground and the arm went limp. ***YOU WILL NOT REMEMBER ME. I WILL CONSUME YOU*** I could now see that everyone heard and felt the voice. Patients and guards alike were holding their head on all of the video feeds. You could feel the presence of Rufus all throughout the building. It was like being in a sauna and having someone with a hot wet towel wrapped around your neck. I felt fatigue grip my whole body and I collapsed to my knees, then puked up what little I had eaten. When my senses returned I ran from the asylum faster than I thought possible.  So now here I sit at home on my little laptop holding my gun as closely as I can. 911 dispatch keeps brushing me off as a prank call, and I think Im going to die. But there is one thing I have that gives me confidence. I have a picture of him, and Im going to try and figure out why he doesn't want me to have it.

I once had an appendicitis and my appendix was is a abnormal place. So when it rupture it completely popped and filled my insides with a purple goo. Plus with the fact that it was in the wrong place the doctors didn't find it for almost a month, resulting in an infection and a month in the hospital where I had 8 IV's hooked up to me and was constantly in pain  TL;DR - don't underestimate any medical condition  edit: I'm also a type 1 diabetic which further complicated things
Thanks!

I think you'd love The Witcher 2: Assassin of kings. It's Really immersive and the gameplay is sweet. It's difficult at first though. It's focus really based off of the characters.
Why does it matter that I pointed it out, I wasn't starting shit. I skateboard and longboard. If someone replied something like "shut the fuck up, longboards are better!" they would be the one starting said shit.
I could go a little bit higher on the price too (530$ish) is there anything more you would recomend adding?
Dude it's a serious question, it's something he's afraid of. Just because you're annoyed by someone trying to get help on a sub where that's totally welcome doesn't mean you get to be a bully and talk about how cool you are, when you say "All I do is wait it and and boooom close your eyes and think of a dream or a mirror and ENTER IT" (or whatever the hell that gibberish means.) or how you "had a Dementor from Harry Potter suck my face when I was in bed. No fucks given. Get the hell over it."  You're not some all knowing lucid dreamer, you're a bully on reddit, and you're the shit that's wrecking this sub *and* reddit as a whole. You fucking snob.
You could use it to go to the future! Although, it might be faster to wait normaly....
I had tons of fun beating the campaign solo, it can be done it's a little bit harder than co-op and after you beat everything you can do what im doing now and collect all of the special guns. Plus with sub-reddits like [r/coopplay ](http://www.reddit.com/r/coopplay) and [r/borderlands](http://www.reddit.com/r/borderlands) you can get co-op players easy! I completely recommend this game, it's my favorite.
PS3 [w] to complete my collection (I need lvl 50s) [h] everything that's not on the list inside    PSN: test_subject3919   want: transformer, bouncing Bonnie, nasty surprise, and I would like legendary heads if you could give them to me preferably zer0 or axton heads!  I don't have the badaboom, but I DON'T want it because I would like to get the last legendary for myself.  Almost all of my guns are lvl 50 except striker is 48 and neogenator and blackhole are 49s I also have sandhawks, evil smasher and fibber
Dude, that's awesome im jelous!
Bitch, you woke up that way too; just like everyone else.

I don't know why but when I saw you it made me really happy
It's mostly just belief and focus, it doesn't always work for me i only go it to work twice. If you're teleporting just focus on where you want to be cover your eyes and imagine a popping sound and then you should be there
