Ahhhhhh I hope I win !!
Crossing my fingers!!  GO Reddit!
How have your sales been this month?   Hi everyone, we have a small bath and body products business in Los Angeles, and I've noticed that sales have been a bit slower this month.  Sales have been climbing for us every month since March, but suddenly I'm finding June to be really slow.  Is it just me lol? This is our first year in retail so I have no idea what types of sales trends are normal.  Thank you ahead of time!
I agree.  It must be because I've kept my HR monitor on auto.  I use the GPS tracker 3-4x a week so I'm sure that doesn't help either.  I've just been so happy with my Force that suddenly having to charge so often has been kind of a bummer lol.
Crossing my fingers! :D
Sorry for being so vague with the question lol.  I hope I can explain it better....   I always try to keep an eye on my google analytics, and the last couple of days I've been getting traffic that landed on Co.lumb.  When I click it, it takes me to http://co.lumb.co/ .  I'm just not sure why people are landing on my blog and it's appearing as Co.lumb.
Awesome!  Thank you so much for letting me know :)
I'm really such a noob and I'm not sure which resources it is lol.  My hosting company pointed me to the "resources" icon on my cpanel and it shows that I've maxed out the usage.  You were absolutely right on the backup plugin being the problem.  I've since installed p3 profiler and apparently the Ready! Backup was taking up the most juice. Since I've disabled it, the blog is much better.  Thank you so much for dropping in and helping me out :)
My dog is pretty quiet, so his way of begging is by staring.  A few times at night I've caught him 2 feet from my face staring.  He wanted to go pee and I was watching a movie on my laptop in the dark.
Thank you guys so much for replying.  I really wasn't sure about it but after everything I've read, and all of your posts.. I think that I'll pass on the offer.
French fries.  Always french fries.
The thumbnail photo made it look like you were fingering air... lol.  The kitty is a cutie!
soooo muchhhh sodiummmmm
I've stopped there a few times and never noticed the baklava milkshakeeeee!  That sounds delicious!
I'm actually not afraid of flying and even though I dry heave, I'm not actually nauseous.  I've tried to suck on ginger candies but the dry heaving doesn't go away.  I've tried taking Bonine but it didn't help either.  One time I took NyQuil which helped me fall asleep, but after 2 hours I woke up with the same symptoms plus body aches :(
I make soap and sell soap, but I still love trying out other people's products :).  I love looking at the ingredients label so anything with fun or exotic butters always catches my eye.  I love an all olive oil soap but I know that it's going to be a little slimy in the shower and have little lather.  I don't personally care if it's colored, but I do LOVE a good exfoliation soap for my body.  For my face I like an unscented or very lightly scented with essential oils, uncolored, bar of soap made with lots of olive oil.
I love your hair!  You look beautiful :D
I do that all of the time!  Cringeeeeee....
Awww she looks so sweet.
o.O
I'm not really sure.. maybe a total of 20-30 minutes?  As soon as we got off the Bart, walked up the stairs, and we saw a line that was already formed outside on the corner.  Someone was there at a table selling round trip tickets.  The shuttle arrived after 10 minutes of waiting and the ride was 15-20 minutes.  Make sure you only use clear bags or gallon ziplocks.  We totally forgot about it, but good thing my purse was pretty small :D  Have a great time if you decide to go!
I LOVE your blog.  There I said it :D That Pesto recipe looks delicious.
OMG please please fire him.  I can not stand Benjy anymore.  I don't know if it's cause he's getting older?  If Elisa is driving him crazy, but Benjy is just becoming more delusional and less funny rapidly.
Yeah definitely a bigger cab with our luggage and carry ons.
Immigration policy?
Hm.. hard to pick just 1... I think that trader joes' dark chocolate peanut butter cups are darn delicious.  Their cookie butter dark chocolate bars are addicting too.  Then there's chocomize where you can add whatever.  I like their premade salty bar.  Kit kats are bomb, and so are almond snickers.  I'm hungry... can you tell? Hahahahah
Henry Cavill.  We were at the Immortals premiere and I saw him take photos with female fans in the theater.  So I gathered up my courage, walked over, and asked if he would take a photo with me... Well he turned around, took a look at me, and said " oh they are going to start  the movie" then went back to chatting with the hot girls.  I guess my t-shirt, jeans, and glasses wasn't very cute :( *edited to remove typo
I love thissssss!! Lol
You would think that with skills like that he'd be super lean.
Sorry to hear about your breakup :( I don't have a lot of advice on this topic since I don't know you or your situation, but I know that you'll be ok.  It probably sucks big time right now... but watch some good movies, eat some good food, and just treat yourself like a king while you ride this whole thing out :D
I think she seems really nice, really pretty, has a great body, but she seems like a bit of a fame whore and she really can't sing.  Benjy and Elisa seem perfect for each other.. both very delusional.. LOL
so cute!
