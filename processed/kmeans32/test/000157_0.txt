Arnold Schwarzenegger: "Climate Change is Not Science Fiction"
Brilliant. And very wise.
TL;DR: What we have is a modern-day case of the emperors new clothes. So many compromises to the truth have been made and careers advanced by hiding or glossing over gender-integration issues in the military. It will take concerted opposition from a range of politicians who have the courage to look beyond the latest headline in the New York Times or on CNN.  edit: paraphrased article.
not really.
That "your words reflect your level of thinking" is the bitter truth. You can either own your words and defend them or resort to looking down on others. Yes, my life must be miserable indeed.  Spending tax payer money, or any other person's money for that matter, on stadiums is a waste of time and benefits no one. That is your level of thinking. Own it, and do not be so cowardly!
Lol.
This is a very very apt depiction of what CU actually is. Actually, the one person doesn't have to own the speaker. He can loan it from his friends from far far away.... Enter Wisconsin.
No, that is not a bad thing. It is the general discussion of the matter that will bring out everything that needs to be considered to do it right. As you have pointed out, if we tilt the scales without providing the environment for and skills that will allow people to break into entrepreneurial endeavors, then we will have a catastrophe as you pointed out.  So your points and concerns are actually very well founded and important sir/madam.
Actually, yes.
But, but.. ?
Yay!

I thought we all were. This is reddit! Every one is here because we all know and are tired of the very fact we are discussing. Yet you want to propagate it. How is that making things better?

The only part I agree with us the part that your suggestions will never happen. You need a good people for that to happen. But if you had a good people, you wouldn't be in this mess in the first place. The system will inevitably collapse on itself. That much is for certain
Pope calls for end to fossil fuels
Where is the decency in this world. At this rate, there will soon be no reasons to wear any clothes at all. Then you'd hear lamentations about how that every guy you encounter only seems to have sex on his mind. ... Go figure.
That's the problem with your reasoning. It is assuming that the gifted ones come from a background of privilege. Do you see the demographics in graduate school? Hmm? You are looking at life from a1950s lens. You can not do anything in this world without at least a college education. And even if you did, you would need a week educated labor force to execute. The 'labor' you speak of, that is, the skilled manufacturing and similar work from the 50s are the programmers and engineers of today.  Please stop this idea that education is not necessary. Why do you want to keep importing education from abroad and allowing your own people to wake away?
This is the problem with the idea that what is the real you is physical. This body along with the brain is just a bio-machine, wet-ware. Like an exoskeleton used by the actual you for an earth-life. You are plugged in during pregnancy, and disconnect once it is destroyed or no longer functional due to irreparable damage or wear and tear from aging. It's really not so difficult to accept this is it?

Who is this government you speak of. What you are really saying here, and cleverly trying to conceal, is that Americans are incompetent. Is there a transformation that goes on between private and public sector? Are 'Americans' in private sector a different species than the ones working in the public sector?  Your argument makes no sense. A system is efficient if it is well funded and managed. When these services are subject to the whims of ideologues, then you have a problem. How about the banking sector? Can you point me to a government fail even remotely close to the epic fail we witnessed in the banking sector recently? The government may be slow and inefficient, but you can be guaranteed that they are not in it to inflate their personal bank accounts...
The lethargy of all things Nigerian government, characteristic of the outgoing 'lame duck' president of Nigeria (Goodluck Jonathan), seems to wane as the country approaches a monumental political transition. This erstwhile attitude is giving way to a more accountable, disciplined, and responsible attitude, which coincidentally are a hallmark of the incoming president elect, Gen Muhammadu Buhari (rtd). The recent military campaigns have successfully rescued victims of Boko Haram by the hundreds. However, there is much needed help and support from the local and international community. These women and children have been systematically traumatized through rape and torture for years. Much psychological, physical, and economic help and support is needed. Please lend your support through positive thoughts, words, and deeds in form of kind or cash. ~ thank you.

Please cite your morality source. And while you do, I'd like you to acknowledge that it is a subjective definition. Put together and agreed upon by what we can all agree is a poorly advanced and highly ignorant masses (as is demonstrated daily). So, while your argument is solid, it is solidly based on a flawed assumption of what morality is understood to be. I for one do not agree with your interpretation of morality so I can not accept your claim. Perhaps if you base your claim on a more fundamental universally accepted fact, then I may be inclined to follow your reasoning.
I am still not past the assumption that they would be any different from the people you see around you. I don't really understand why they have to absolutely look different. I believe we are configured this way because it is optimal for our species.  Based on what we can observe, the laws under which the universe operates, which we are trying to understand through the sciences of physics, chemistry and biology etc, (which are really only observation of what is out there) is present everywhere. All the celestial bodies, of which the earth is one of billions, operate under the same uniform laws.  I believe it is just naive to think that randomness is responsible for anything. There is no randomness observed here on earth (except people and their childish nature) but by and large, everything operates under strict laws. If this is so, then i would expect aliens to look exactly as we do!
I met my wife at a seminar. And she into anime and ask the games I loved as a kid. Seriously though, you will also find the same type of women in the plus size section as you would in any other section, haven't you figured that out yet? Let me help you. Think of all the idiots you've met your entire life (male or female), do they all fall in any one section? There's your answer.
Actually, they managed to show one side as being completely wrong ALL the time. And how until the very end, we assumed the same. The humans were wrong ALL the time. ALL of it. So it wasn't the case that both sides were right and wrong. One side was right. One side was always right. And one side was wrong, that side was ALWAYS wrong! I really enjoy your emphasis on the fact that Will consciously attacked weapons and never the humans.
