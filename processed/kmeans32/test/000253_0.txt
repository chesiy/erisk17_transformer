(USA) a-PVP.. where's it at?
I think that mostly depends on the method you used to pay for them. Idk for sure though, somebody please correct me if need be.

Yeah I guess it can't hurt to swap the filter out and see what happens. Just after the warranty ran out, the brake line blew, and we took it back to the garage, where I was prepared to pay the full fee in order to have it changed, and the guy did it completely for free, so maybe he'll help me out. Lol. Probably not though. Ok, so I just started it up and got it up on some ramps. It was knocking right after it started, then it stopped, I drove it up onto the ramps and while I was driving up the ramps, it started knocking loudly, and the oil pressure light came on. I got to the top of the ramp and put it in park and I hopped out to go open the hood while it was still idling, and then I sort of heard a thunk and the knocking went away and the oil pressure light shut off and then it seemed ok, other than a very small knocking noise, which I could have probably dismissed as normal any other day.
Well, he did put a hit out on a dude. What do you think he should get? lol
Oh I know I'm right, that's why I agree with you bro. My buddy was taking 5 grams of all natural Red Sumatran after he came down on Adderall, and it basically just took the edge off and let him sleep. I said "No, no, no, you're doing it wrong" and I handed him a few Xanax for the next time he was coming down off Adderall. He took them and just banged his head off stuff in his apartment for about an hour and then he passed out. I was happy to reduce his harm that day. We're doing the Lord's work, son.
There's no way of knowing whether it will help the worst of your withdrawals, because we don't know how much morphine will be in your tea. It has the potential to get you higher than kratom ever could if it's a good batch, so obviously that would obliterate withdrawals. There's just no way to know without either doing it or doing some fancy pants lab magic and finding out how much morphine is in it. And yeah, definitely a cross tolerance. I mean, maybe if you sip tiny amounts every day, don't even catch any sort of buzz, and just not get sick... I suppose kratom may work again after a while of that. But I don't really know, there's just no telling with PST.
I'm envious of you then lol. Last time I took a half g of Maeng Da, my skull felt like it was caving in. Weird shit man.
So the only angle they must have is a plan to reveal the strain names after so long then right? That would be the only thing that makes sense. It's still not right to leave people clueless about whether they're uppers or downers or inbetweeners though. Granted, people don't have to take them, but it just seems like a foolish move on MS's part. But then again, they must be doing something right lol.
Yeah. I should have heeded your warning.
From all the bad batches I keep hearing about from here and there, I'm sure as fuck not venturing out and trying a new vendor anytime soon lol. I'm content enough as it is, even if some people say it's mediocre (which I don't think it is), at least I know what I'm getting.
That's how you know it's good.
Boy, I must be some sort of retard. I thought you meant send the kratom to a lab. I tried imagining your buddy sending a cooler full of urine specimens in with a sack of kratom tucked into it. Ha.
That's a true statement.
Real men have to shoot their load all over themselves when they toilet jerk cuz their wieners are too long to aim down into the toilet.
"Exploded when it hit my throat" Thanks for giving me an at-work boner. Might have to go for a toilet jerk.
Mail it.
Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.
You just gotta get good at spreading the ballskin taut, and then itching it. I love it. Feels like Jesus is touching my nutsack.
Oh and mix Green Vein Bali with the Red Vein Borneo, or Red Sumatran or Red Thai or whatever. That's the ticket, boy.
That's extremely common. Generally speaking, if you execute sexy-time with your old lady, you'll still end up with a boner and the desire to make her fat rolls quiver. You just have to go for it.
He wakes up, hits the bathroom for a quick jack-off (his wife is a cunt), and then he uses a trowel to scoop heaps of phenibut into his mouth. Then he mumbles and stumbles for a bit, bumps his head on some things, gets some coffee and walks to work. Then he's set for the day. He says his hands have never been as steady as phenibut makes them. I suppose that's a good thing, considering he's a dentist.
Dude, an activation rig consists of a magnetron daisy-chained inline with a 2 farad capacitor (500 volt of course) and a low-fidelity digitizer. Do you even kratom, bro? I feel so bad for people who ingest dormant kratom... my life hasn't been the same since I built my activation rig.
Just dump it out into a pile on a GLASS plate, and get a TV remote. Make sure the batteries in the remote are good. Point the remote at the pile while holding down one button for 20 minutes... any button, doesn't matter. After 20 minutes, all static will have dissipated no matter how large the pile. Make sure you don't let go of the button at any time while you're pointing the remote at it or you'll have to start all over again.
WHAT
iOSPoundcake?
DAMN. THAT BROTHER ASTUTE.
Fuck yeah
P.S.  your user name is awesome
I chase every burn with a few gulps of ginger ale. I thought it was stupid when I first heard about it, but I tried it the first time and my nausea instantly was gone. Haven't gotten nauseous since.
I get it from Herbal Salvation. I get the Green Bali and the Red Vein Sumatran. I take it 2 parts RVS to 1 part Green Bali. I always dose the exact same amount and my tolerance hasn't changed.... but I've also learned to appreciate the subtle effects, I don't go into it looking to get blasted... although my morning one is always stupendous.
I've been going with MmmS but i recently put in an order to HS after seeing all the glowing reports concerning HS on here. The estimated delivery was supposed to be today, but it hasn't even made it out of Idaho yet. WTF! Again, it's USPS's fault, not HS... it just sucks cuz I'm really looking forward to it lol. Hopefully it gets straightened out before I run out of my current supply.
