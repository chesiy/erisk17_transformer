I tend to think you're being disingenuous at this point. Do you not recall the homosexuality/Chick-fil-A dustup?  If not, [here's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chick-fil-A_same-sex_marriage_controversy) the Wikipedia entry.  Clearly the public will not "punish" all businesses for being anti-homosexuality. We have a modern example where the business actually benefited from it.
That's my point.  I'm really not aware of a concept of "free speech" apart from the public right. The government is supposed to get out of the debate so it can be freely had. And the point of all this is not to debate _per se_, it's for ideas to compete, and win or lose based on their merits (e.g., feeding babies = good, child rape = bad).  But when a private individual says "_X_ is wrong", it's no one's place to then force that individual to say otherwise. I'm gay but don't think I can go into Mike Huckabee's house and force him to give me a platform to advocate gay marriage. However, if he has opened his house up to debate (better analogy to Reddit), and then decides to close it - well, all we can do is leave.  But in both examples, no one's free speech has been violated. It just doesn't seem to be a concept that withstands scrutiny when invoked as between two private individuals.  Do you have a link to a treatise on non-public freedom of speech? I'm genuinely curious because this comes up every time a corporation does something that someone disagrees with (e.g., Chick-fil-A).
Holy shit.
he can't know that unless he was told so in which case he would have a nice suit on his hands.  Without getting into a semantic fight over "know", I don't see why not. I'm sure past experience with racism creates patterns.  And surely you don't think that every legally actionable wrong is provable in court?
I like the idea of asking every single business I go to if I am welcome.  Edit: I could make it a thing. I know someone with Glass. Governor Shithead is a homophobe, but are Indy fans? ... on second thought...
16 year old test_subject937 rejoices!  The timing is funny. It used to be where the new CookOut is going in on Washington Road. Nothing has been successful since Fazoli's left, but I'm sure CookOut will be.  The Curse of Fazoli's is finally about to be lifted and they're coming back!
You're just moving the goal posts now.  You originally quite clearly said that executive agreements cannot have the force of federal law (i.e., "No. They. Do. Not"). I provided specific case law from the Supreme Court showing that you are wrong.  You're trying to back peddle now by saying "most" have congressional input. That wasn't your original claim at all.  You're also now admitting you're not an expert, which I take to mean you have no legal training. I do, including studying international law in the U.S. and abroad. You're understanding of the law here is simply wrong.  Edit: And for crying out loud... the paragraph immediately before the first you cited contradicts your point. Don't selectively quote, please.
U3 *is* pretty at low of 5.6% though (as are U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6). It's only misleading if you start switching between different "U"s.  The measurements all track each other fairly well so referencing any one of them can be a good measure of the *relative* strength of the job market. ([Here's](http://i.imgur.com/tWpxVFu.jpg) what looks to be an accurate chart that shows this.)

This feels weird but here goes! My amazing, adorable, funny, beautiful, huggable niece is going off to college and needs a tablet/laptop. I wouldn't ask if she absolutely wasn't the best niece on the planet. To butter you guys up, here's a song to you, from her. (Crowdfunding link in comments.)

I'm not basing this just on the President. I'm basing it also on *the Republican-led committees*. All *seven*. Not everything bad that happens is the result of ill intentions. Sometimes shit happens and mistakes are made. All evidence in this matter indicates that's exactly what happened here.  You're basing your position on your own assumptions, and that's it.
The downtown is subpar relative to Greenville, I'll agree. But it's not bad on its own. I work and play mostly downtown and love it.  Have you been to Craft   Vine? That is a great bar. So is Bee's Knees. There's some room to grow but we definitely have some good bars.  I will have to completely disagree about the restaurants. Frog Hollow was singled out by GQ magazine as a must visit restaurant. And if we are extending out beyond downtown (which I don't think your original complaint was limited to downtown), there's Oliviana's, Fifth and Finch, Tako Sushi, Manuel's, Calvert's, La Maison, and 5 O'clock Bistro. Augusta is known for having many restaurants because of Masters week: many can make enough that one week to survive all year.  I'll also have to strongly disagree about the outdoor aspect. We host the largest Ironman in the country, are the home of disc golf, have a nice river and a canal, great bike trails, and generally pleasant weather. If you think Augusta isn't an "outdoor town", I suggest you're not taking advantage of what it offers.  As for live sporting - I'll agree except for the GreenJackets. But I see that as a function of size. How many cities our size have a lot of live sporting options? Ditto for live music.  Finally, as an unmarried professional, Augusta is overflowing with dating opportunities (and I'm a gay man which limits the pool significantly). Granted, I'm in a three year relationship but am involved and attend SO many things for the young professional crowd and EVERYONE is single.  Overall, my view is that your attitude plays a big part in all this. If you think Augusta sucks, you'll focus on the negative and Augusta will suck. But if you focus on the positive, you will see a city exploding with new and exciting things.  I love it here, and can back that up quite easily.
OP, don't listen to folks like this. Augusta has a large melancholy band of pessimists that poop on everything about Augusta.  The area is objectively nice: good climate, good economy, cheap standard of living, access to outdoor activities, plenty of restaurants, etc.  Plus we just built the first new nuclear reactors in the country and are now the home of the U.S. Army's Cyber Command (fun tech development).  Welcome and I hope you enjoy our city!
Of course I'm referring to race. You must live in that conservative fantasy colorblind world, despite all evidence to the contrary.  Do you not recognize the racial problem in our justice/political system? Because acceptance of that fact is Step 1 in this discussion.  As for your last point... did you hear about the rioting and looting at the Pumpkin Festival up north, and all the hooligans who were arrested, and shot and killed?
Yes, I have. Quit being a condescending prick.  To bring up an example you used elsewhere in this thread...  There is zero practical difference between the government telling me to keep $20 more of my income and the government taxing me as usual but sending me $20. It reduces the amount of money in the government coffers exactly the same (and increase my money exactly the same).  Whatever amount of money you got to keep because you took the student loan interest deduction can just as easily be viewed as a check from the government.
Yeah it's not that hard to do just as quickly. I'm American and chose to switch to 24-hour because it makes more sense and is useful for my work. That was about 5 years ago and 20:15 means the same thing in my head that 8:15 p.m. does. No math needed.
