[Request] A Discontinued Lotion. Breathe Romance, Bath and Body Works   Not sure if this is the best subreddit. I'm looking for a discontinued lotion from bath and body works called Breathe Romance. My friend wants it for her Birthday but I can't do $60 a bottle. I was hoping an awesome person on Reddit here would sell me a partially used bottle for a little cheaper.      Please let me know if you guys have any ideas!!! My friend really loves this lotion
Sleepy Pug Cuddles are the Best
Afraid to go to the hospital, Afraid to go to work, One has to happen.   This will be a messy post, I'm sure.   Running on very little sleep the past few days.  Where to start.. Maybe a little about myself. I'm a 24 year old female. Friday night my significant other decided to break off our relationship. Needless to say this was upsetting, though it wasn't really the problem. The problem is I've been using the relationship as a sort of bandage to cover up numerous insecurities and phobias. Now that its gone, there is nothing holding back the floodgates in my head. Word vomit is spinning in circles around my mind and driving me crazy for lack of a better term. What seems to help quiet the noise in my head is interacting with other people and pacing or doing another activity that requires use of my, at the moment, very limited supply of energy. Friday night, or Saturday morning I should probably say, I couldn't get to sleep until around 5 am when I passed out from pure exhaustion. I woke up a little under two hours later after a terrible nightmare and couldn't go back to sleep. I spent the rest of the morning quietly pacing the house and shaking from the effort until my roommate woke up and we could start our day. Now its 2 am on Sunday and I'm so very tired that its making me sick. I'm hungry too but I'm fairly sure if I eat I'll throw up. I seem to have terrible nightmares when I'm stressed and after last night I'm not really eager to do a repeat. But I desperately need to sleep. When I lay down I can't stop the spiral of thoughts from crashing down on me so I started just kind of rocking back and forth and petting my dog, trying really hard to not think about anything at all.      It occurs to me now that its highly doubtful I can function like this at work on Monday, having what will probably be a total of only 4 hours of sleep in a 72 ish hour period. I feel like my body is already trying to shut down. But if I don't go to work then I will need a damn good excuse. At this point, the only thing I can come up with is going to admit myself to the hospital. Which might not be such a bad idea given my mental state, but I'm absolutely terrified of the place.      I had to spend a week in the psychiatric ward about 4 years ago and over half that week was not voluntary. The doctors were not friendly and most of the other patients either annoyed or scared me. Participating in the group activities was very difficult because I'm extremely shy, which made me seem even more difficult to the doctors, who subsequently liked me even less. I could tell I was frustrating them because all I wanted to do was sleep and pace around my room until they fixed my medication to their liking and I could leave. They didn't think fixing my medication was good enough so I asked to leave at which point I was told that I would then be held involuntarily and would end up needing a court order to leave and spend a minimum of 30 days there if I didn't calm down. At that point I became extremely claustrophobic and panicked and spent a day refusing to talk to anyone. They chalked this behavior up to a bad reaction to a new medication they had just tried to switch me to and switch me to something else. Things did get a little better from there but the facility was still very daunting. The sheets were not comfortable to sleep on and having someone come in to my room every hour wore on my nerves to the point where I broke a few times and told them to get out. I try very hard to always be polite and not throw fits like that but to me this hospital environment was truly terrible and I wanted desperately to go home the whole time. Most of the books I asked to be brought I wasn't even allowed to read because they were science fiction and the doctors said that they would encourage some delusions.      I'm not anxious to go back to this hospital for any kind of mental condition. The thought absolutely terrifies me. So does the thought of losing my job and not being able to pay my bills.      I believe if I do admit myself to the hospital, my job cannot legally fire me and likely wouldn't because they do sincerely seem to like me. I've only been at this place for 6 months and already had to miss two days from two separate episodes of strep throat. I hate missing work. I want them to see me as reliable. I'm only a temp and not hired on permanently yet so I'm worried too that if the hospital kept me too long, they could let me go anyways simply because I am only there on a temp basis right now and they don't need a valid reason.      I could try and go to work Monday, but I'm already cringing at the thought. I'm shaking from lack of sleep and trying to exert to much energy today. and I'm physically sick from not being able to eat enough. I feel like throwing up and have a terrible headache from crying and having a little panic attack (at least I think that's what it was, I've never had one of those before).      I work in a cubicle doing data entry. The work is very repetitive and will allow me too much time to dwell on things that I really don't need to be thinking about right now. Which will likely just make me cry and then panic because I can't stop crying and I'd be too near people that they might hear. Talking about my diminished mental state with any of my coworkers is not something I want to do. I do not want to seem mentally unfit in anyway to my boss. I cannot afford to lose this job.      So I am caught between a rock and a very hard place. Going to the hospital would be terrifying and I don't want to do that. Going to work in this state is also equally undesirable.      I am not sure what to do.
Thank you
I rewrote some things, check it out when you get the chance if you would.      I took your advice on leaving the portals visible but low profile and not having things have to will themselves through to the other side. Hopefully I did a better job of making it seem less like the humans were inferior to the visitors and more like the visitors simply acted that way.

I agree!! I just want to squish that cute little face!! :)

Portable laptop for writing (In the range of $300 or less*)   EDIT UPDATE : I believe I have decided to go with a Chromebook after reading an article a guy had wrote who also loved loves the Scrivener program. I will still definitely be emailing the Scrivener team to check into making an app that would work with Chromebook but I will research utilizing Google Docs for now.  If anyone else is having the same issue, here is the article that changed my mind: http://www.jamierubin.net/2013/03/24/writing-with-the-google-chromebook/   Original Post: I don't have the money yet but I want to plan out what some of my best options are . Looking for my most portable option for writing. I will need the internet for research as well.  **LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE**     * Country of purchase: United States of America    * Budget range: Under $300  *hopefully*    * Purpose (netbook, ultraportable, mainstream, gaming, desktop replacement, etc.)  I need it to be as ultraportable as possible. I want to be able to take it everywhere. I am in desperate need of a way to write on the go. I type fast and prefer it to writing by hand.    * Screen size preference: Around 14" or less, I want a small size for portability    * OS preference (Windows/ Mac/ Linux):   I prefer windows. Have not had a lot of experience with Mac systems  * Gaming requirements (example games and desired fps/settings):   This laptop won't be for gaming. Ill just need to be able to do research on the internet.  * Performance requirements (video, CAD, etc.):   I would like a fairly good wireless card installed. I do a lot of research on web in  lot of different areas. Right now all of it is done from my phone.  * Method of computer support (office supplier, college bookstore, self support):   Google. Im fairly good with computers. Just looking for suggestions here. Laptops are not my specialty  * Brand preferences and reasons (already owned accessories, familiarity, business  compatibility):   Open to suggestions.  * Any particular style that you like (examples are great):   Just looking for something portable  * Which of the following qualities would you prefer? (Choose one, the other, or balanced)     * Long battery life -vs- Low weight:   Low weight  * Build quality -vs- Low price:   Maybe a little in between? I dont want it to break immediately  * Low noise/heat -vs- High performance:   Low noise would be nice  **Would you pay a premium for something that has:**   There aren't really any extra features I want  * High resolution screen:   Doesn't matter  * A great keyboard:   The keyboard is pretty important. It will be used quite a bit  * A great touchpad/mouse buttons:   I usually plug in a mouse. I've never liked touchpads  * Great audio:   Doesn't matter  **List any features that are critical:** (e.g. Optical drive, USB 3.0, SD card slot, ethernet port, HDMI port, bluetooth, VGA port, removable battery, glossy sjcreen, matte screen, etc.)  A screen that doesn't glare easy would be nice but not if it hikes the price too much. I need a few usb ports for a mouse and flashdrives.
Perhaps they will consider bringing the abrasiveness back to some of the characters in another installment then. Either way, it makes no difference to me, the thing I like most about the game is collecting items and decorating and interacting online with people. I rarely have the music turned up
