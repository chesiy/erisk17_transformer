At least it can fit into tight corners that a regular pitchfork cant!
Very true my friend, can't win on either side haha but it motivates me to strengthen my arguments and convictions
Hershey, PA  Didn't invent chocolate but we sell a shit ton of it   EDIT: I could give ya guys a couple more facts about Hershey that you didn't know about if anyone's interested haha
There's nothing glaring really. There's just a lot of money and incentives for scientists to prove their points right. Ridley talks about this one graph (forgive me for forgetting the minutia)  that was influential in climate science. In this graph there was a set of points that were in the graph inappropriately to skew the way people interpreted. They did it knowingly. Ridley found this out and removed the false data and it wasn't as scary as once made to believe.
I wouldn't be shocked if he didn't. John is a weird dude. I think he said when working on Stadium Arcadium he used to listen to 36 chambers by Wu Tang Clan everyday ha
I got Rand Paul, but I'm also a big supporter of his. I think it's decent but shouldn't be used as your definitive response. Lucky for you though, because you have over a year to make an informed decision. Since the primaries haven't begun yet, you're in good shape. Listen to debates as they happen, find positives and negatives about each candidate before you decide. Don't judge the candidates based on their media perspective. Judge them primarily by their actions. Words are usually empty promises. See what they have actually done or tried as a judge of their character.

False Flag Operations?
I had to do an english paper on it years ago. I saw it at a bookstore asked my teacher if I could do it, he said yeah. I never heard of the book before, but thought I'd give it a try. Glad I did.
I apologize, you didn't deserve that response brother. Just the inner Libertarian in me having to read the insatiable bone cone for Bernie Sanders news on reddit gets on my nerves. All your points are fair points and aren't that far fetched at all. Take it easy.
Someone please take this thread down. No good discussion is going to come from it. Just incessant blabbering that people have heard a million times and are desensitizing the issue. I'm not saying we shouldn't talk about it, just this isn't the right forum.
I appreciate it man
Yes this is perfect! Thanks so much! Can you link the thread too?
Twenty one pilots!!
Any recommended help websites?   Ive been a long time civilization revolution player, and am still adjusting to the new and more expansive civ 5. I don't have any of the expansion map packs/scenarios. I know how the game works, I've played a few. I was wondering if there were any help sites that would help the transition to go smoother.
When?
I can see that, I'm one of the people that thought it was stoner wanna-be's that listened to them. Then I gave them a real look and realized that pink Floyd is beyond all that and I don't associate my fandom with drugs at all
My favorite song hands down off Dark Side, no question about it. Listening to that solo in the right environment is a border line religious experience. Also the lyricism in this song is so superb, and it's genius for them to do the Breathe Reprise, I absolutely love this tune.
cheers mate
As you can see, less than half my artists have had an album come out in 2014, but thats all good. I finally listened to artists that I never really listened to before and I loved them. I might also add youtube links to some songs from these artists :)   * 1) Pink Floyd - knew about them of course, really delved into their material and was blow away, I consider them one of my favorite bands of all-time. I even enjoyed The Endless River, to a certain extent, even though a lot of people didn't as much. I think that album has a time and place, and can't be listened to at any moment like some of their albums   * 2) The Killers - liked them when I was younger, got back into them and I think Sam's Town has aged realllllly well   * 3) Sage Francis - Man did this dude's new album swing hard, wooooo I love his venom   * 4) Modest Mouse - always knew the "hits" but listened to them a bunch more, I really dig the song, "Bankrupt On Selling"  * 5) Gorillaz - listened to the entire Demon Dayz album, and holllly shiiiit, it was gnarly   * 6) Twenty One Pilots - These two dudes have become one of my favorite bands, I think after their 3rd album these guys are gonna explode more than they already have, I'm super looking forward to their next project  * 7) Marina and the Diamonds - I was debating on not putting her on here, primarily because her lyrics aren't great and all that negative connotations that pop music brings, but I'll be damned if I didn't find her so catchy. She's my guilty pleasure - come hate me haha   *  8) St. Vincent - Digital Witnesses is my favorite song off her latest album, it's a fun album for me   * 9) The Naked   Famous - first heard them in FIFA, I totally dig their style and the female singer is something I totally dig  * 10) Atmosphere - Southsiders had it's moments, not the greatest album, I think I enjoyed it more than most Atmosphere fans. Flicker is my favorite song because I'm an Eyedea fan, so I thought it was a great song. I also started listening to his older discog a bit more, and I think Slug can straight spit fire
Cocks out lads!
FUCK! I GUESSED SHMELLOW
Time 3:18-4:45, pretty much just sex on my ears, one day I'm gonna find a nice girl and impregnate her to this solo.
Special shoutout to you too man. Hope to see you around here from time to time too.
And sisters! You eugenist
That's kinda the joke I'm going for. We all live our lives assuming God doesn't exist. So if we get to the Pearly Gates, we're all gonna say... "shit" because obviously we won't be getting in. Don't think too hard
Yeah Pete Townsend took them to a whole new level. As for another contributor, I think Neil Peart, the drummer from Rush is up there. He is a really smart dude that also writes the lyrics, lots of good lyricism in Rush songs. Not to mention, he's one of the best drummers out there.  I think it's also fair to mention John Frusciante of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Once he joined RHCP, he changed the game for them. Him and Jimi Hendrix are two guitarists that I really think are 'one' with their guitar/sound. So good to listen to.
They recently came to Hershey, PA. Near where I'm from, and I think some people said they put on a pretty good show. I'm not a fan of theirs myself, but I can appreciate good showmanship
you're awesome
I've definitely said some bannable things, but I haven't been chat restricted. Not necessarily raging, more or less I've said things in jest. Essentially my point is, system seems incredibly broken.
I hate cosplay and think it's one of the most awkward things I could ever witness. If I'm ever fortunate to have kids some day, I'd rather walk in on them beating off than have them dressed as a league character and dancing To make a YouTube video.
I feel the exact same way man. It's been well documented that the toxicity of the LoL community is pretty great. I see posts all the time about these issues and it happens to me all the time too. I actually almost considered quitting the game entirely because I was amazed at how selfish most players are. Reminding people to be nice to other people, and remember who is actually behind the computer screen doesn't really work. In theory its great, and practical, but its so easy to be angry. So really the only way to make great environments for playing is for riot to take drastic action, and place all the trolls together. But they've already stated that they won't do that, so don't hold your breath for any changes in the ranked environment any time soon. Essentially the only time I feel like I'm in a relaxed environment is when I'm in normals, and the result of the match doesn't really matter to me. So good luck in trying to get out of bronze and thence forward. :)
