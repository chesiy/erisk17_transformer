I guess so, but that doesn't make it any less true
First of all, Plinkett elaborated as to why that shot didn't work in comparison to the opening shot of A New Hope.  Second, there's no way Roger Ebert gave TPM 4 and 1/2 stars because his rating only goes up to 4 - it was 3 and 1/2 stars.  And third - there was tons of effort put into the prequels by the actors and most of the crew, but George Lucas is not a good director. Watch the interview Ewan McGregor did on The Graham Norton show the other week, where he tells a story about how Lucas has a lot of trouble directing characters. He puts visuals above story a lot of the time, which leads to a bad movie.  I could very easily go out and make a crummy movie, and say that it's a homage to bad movies like Howard the Duck and Jaws 4, but that doesn't justify it being bad.
Yeah
Pretty nice, though I wish you had done Nimoy as Spock in place of the "Chewie, we're home" part
I wouldn't give up hope completely.  Who knows? This might not even be true. At the very least we'll get some new bits of info, and maybe some behind the scenes footage of even a poster.
It sounds believable but you have no proof. Some of that is based on rumors, some are just things that one would logically assume. I could very easily make up something like that and have it sound true.  Not saying that it's all BS, but I'm just gonna have to take it with a grain of salt.
Read about it man. I went, and it was incredible. It's not just a film, they've recreated scenes and sets right out of the movies, and everyone is in character. You can trade with people, have food and drink, and go on different quests to find things - if was fantastically well done, and very very fun. A must-go for any Star Wars fan.
I guess so
The Empire Strikes Back
Don't just assume that mobile = bad.
Not trying to tell you that you should like it, everyone's entitled to their opinions, but that's sorta the point -  It's basically a piece of cinematic "art." I know it sounds pretentious or whatever, but you're supposed to interpret it how *you* want to interpret it. There's not gonna be an explanation, because it's up to you to explain it to yourself, if that makes sense.
Well, you proved me wrong. I really appreciate you taking the time to find that direct quote and showing me how you were right this whole time.  :/

Here you go. These are just the first few that I thought of. Don't go with the assumption that every pre-1960 movie is a wacky Three Stooges-esque screwball comedy   Citizen Kane Casablanca  Paths of Glory Ben-Hur The Bridge on the River Kwai The Wizard of Oz Singin' in the Rain 12 Angry Men Gone with the Wind It's a Wonderful Life Rear Window North by Northwest Vertigo Metropolis Seven Samurai Anatomy of a Murder Some Like it Hot On the Waterfront Mr. Smith Goes to Washington Snow White and the Seven Dwarves
I wondered if I should put it on, and I almost left it out, but there are some people out there who seem to like it...
Well, he was sorta the key to all of it, he was a funnier character than they've ever had
