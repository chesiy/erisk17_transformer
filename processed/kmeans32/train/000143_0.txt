[Spoilers] Question about the ending to "The Man in the Iron Mask."   The book ends just after d'Artagnan's final words:  "AthosPorthos, farewell till we meet again! Aramis, adieu forever!"   I'm not sure how to interpret this, is he making the distinction between Aramis and the others because Aramis is the only one still alive, or because he doesn't think he will be seeing Aramis in the afterlife like the others? Anyone have a take on this?
It's a great book, it's just a bit hard to get used to the way it's written, as if Forrest himself is writing it, bad grammar and all.   At first, when I's growin up, she'd let me go out an play with everbody, but then she foun out they's teasing me an all, an one day a boy hit me in the back with a stick wile they was chasin me an it raised some fearsome welt.
It seems OP is the same creator of this one:  http://www.dcoc-vr.com/  Which does support prepar3d.
Cool, so if I want to upgrade to a 970 I don't have to worry about bottlenecking?
I believe that particular image that referenced (this one [RES ignored duplicate link]) is actually fake.  It's not really "fake", it's just a composite image where they picked the best satellite images and stitched them together. According to NASA, it's even true-color.

Yes, Stephen went the extra mile with it.
These are basically the main characters for most of the book, but yes, I guess they are difficult names. What I mean is that it's a pretty superficial question covered in the first few pages, which was probably all he read to come up with it.
These were previously at a zoo in Europe, but they weren't breeding so it was decided to move them back to their natural habitat to see if that would get the breeding going.  There's an episode of a show called Last Chance to See (also a great book by Douglas Adams) with Stephen Fry that explains and shows the move.
Isn't it a porpoise?
Louis was his dad.
The Harry Potter movies made almost 8bi, so any of the recurring actors would beat the 4bi.
dialed it out  What does this mean?
Oh, ok. I was under the impression that DVI was a bit inferior to HDMI but google tells me it isn't so. Great, thanks.
Yep, [the guy whom the TC didn't even credit.](http://capybarasthatlooklikerafaelnadal.tumblr.com/)
Firefox also gives me the "This Connection is Untrusted" message. Weird.
Euros *per kilogram*. So you can safely be damn sure.
Weirdest thing, after making that post I went in search of it like I've done countless times and actually found it on ebay!  I didn't have an issue number, just [this image](http://i.imgur.com/ZyPecue.png) from the Stephen Fry documentary.   Can't wait for it to arrive, today was a good day.

[Damn you!](http://i.imgur.com/alf2XYL.png)  Getting that was a bit of a relief, I was a bit addicted to the game, but after that I just closed the tab and never went back.
I had something like 101% on his class because of all the extra credit he gives, and it's all just "bubble in alternative A on question 1 and hand it in".  His tests are based off the chapter outlines you can find on the editor's website, so you don't even need the book. Just be prepared to memorize a lot of stuff.
I only picked it up because I recently moved to an apartment where my bedroom window faces the west. I woke up one morning with the full moon near the horizon at sunrise and thought "oh yeah, that makes sense."
Just go [here](http://www.youtube.com/account), there should be a link to disconnect it from G+ right bellow your e-mail.  No need to delete your youtube account like the other guy said.
Administrative assistant is just a fancy term for secretary/receptionist, in most cases.
It is, just got the notice I have premium today.
Great, thanks.
My first build, have a few questions and could use some feedback.   Trying to build a gaming PC, basically used Logical Increments to come up with:    Type|Item|Price :----|:----|:---- **CPU** | [Intel Core i5-4430 3.0GHz Quad-Core Processor](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/intel-cpu-bx80646i54430) | $189.29 @ Amazon  **Motherboard** | [MSI Z87-G45 Gaming ATX LGA1150 Motherboard](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/msi-motherboard-z87g45gaming) | $154.99 @ Amazon  **Memory** | [Corsair Vengeance 8GB (2 x 4GB) DDR3-1600 Memory](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/corsair-memory-cmz8gx3m2a1600c9) | $74.94 @ Amazon  **Storage** | [Sandisk Ultra Plus 128GB 2.5" Solid State Disk](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/sandisk-internal-hard-drive-sdssdhp128gg25) | $96.86 @ Amazon  **Storage** | [Western Digital Caviar Blue 1TB 3.5" 7200RPM Internal Hard Drive](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/western-digital-internal-hard-drive-wd10ezex) | $67.80 @ Amazon  **Video Card** | [EVGA GeForce GTX 660 2GB Video Card](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/evga-video-card-02gp42660kr) | $199.99 @ Amazon  **Case** | [Corsair 400R ATX Mid Tower Case](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/corsair-case-400r) | $98.91 @ Amazon  **Power Supply** | [SeaSonic M12II 650W 80 PLUS Bronze Certified ATX12V / EPS12V Power Supply](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/seasonic-power-supply-ss650am) | $104.99 @ Amazon  **Optical Drive** | [LG WH14NS40 Blu-Ray/DVD/CD Writer](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/lg-optical-drive-wh14ns40) |- **Operating System** | [Microsoft Windows 8 (OEM) (64-bit)](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/microsoft-os-wn700404) | $88.90 @ Amazon   | | **Total**  | Prices include shipping, taxes, and discounts when available. | $1076.67  The only things I can remember that I didn't take from LI were the RAM and optical drive, are those 2 alright? Any other comments on the parts are also highly appreciated.  The thing I'm most concerned about in the build are the cables, I get pretty lost when people start hooking everything up in the videos I watch. Is it easy to find clear instructions in the manuals? And most importantly, do I need to buy any cables, or are they all included with the parts? (the optical drive is what got me worried)  Thanks for any help.

What we see when we look up at the ISS is light reflecting over all the surfaces it has, especially the solar panels, so it can usually be seen by a large area of land. A beam of light would be visible only to the people it's pointed at, and even then only barely, compared to the rest of the light coming from it.  I think you would see better results just by getting the message out on how to spot it. My mind was pretty thoroughly blown the first time I saw it, now I show it to people every chance I get.   Edit: I guess that when the ISS is completely in the dark, you could see only the light if it's aimed at you, but it would have to be pretty darn powerful to be even slightly visible.
I don't see how nuclear power can be "statistically safer" than solar power.
