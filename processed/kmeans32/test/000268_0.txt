My problem is that I'm not the one home to get them to clean up after themselves.  I can get them to clean on the weekends SOME, but if my wife would step up and help, it'd be awesome.
The full expression is "deus ex machina", and it is a character or thing that suddenly enters the story in a novel, play, movie, etc., and solves a problem that had previously seemed impossible to solve.

It's just the track-record of his shows.  My original post was meant to be sort of tongue-in-cheek.  I like that article though.
It's SFW... there's nothing there except a woman in a shirt.  Did you try /r/GrossFingernails ?
Well, if that is true, I greatly appreciate the comment!
You're welcome--LOL!
Here ya go, /u/Sapitoelgato:  [Darth Lloyd's Force Ghost](http://i.imgur.com/vGppq6V.jpg).
ALWAYS start with the Thrawn trilogy (Heir to the Empire, Dark Force Rising and The Last Command).  If you do, you'll want to read them all.  Stay away from "The Crystal Star".  It was bizarre and pointless.
I am an electrical designer for an electrical engineer. We do consulting engineering, and are mostly hired by architects to design the electrical portions of projects (e.g., lighting, power, mechanical connections, special systems, etc.)  I was offered a job by my potential parents-in-law. I started off answering phones, and making deliveries. I moved up to simply drafting other people's mark-ups. Now I do the design on my own.  I have no EE degree nor PE stamp, but I could go back in the future to obtain them if I wish.
"Welcome to the crappy world of paying your own bills, sir."  HAHAHAHA!  So true.  These people don't know how hard it is to live when you aren't getting free shit from the government.  Downvote this all you want; it's true.
But he's not racist, because I've been told several times that a minority CAN'T be racist.....
It's the same where I live (in Baton Rouge, Louisiana). You aren't alone.  And I hate it when after making a generalized statement, people immediately come back and say "not all of them are....".  Yeah--no crap, there isn't a single thing in the world that is 100% the same across the board.  /u/promisejustcurious is simply stating that in the are where they work, black people seem to be disrespectful of people's time, money, and service.
Boobs.
Agreed.  I've been working part- or full-time since I was 15yo.  I had to so I could pay for my phone and car insurance.  Then it moved to helping pay for rent/bills when my parents divorced, and my mom didn't have a GREAT job.  I had to grow up quickly.
This sounds like me and my wife.  We're doing MyFitnessPal and FitBit combos.  Dieting is hard.  We caved today, and got bundlets from Nothing Bundt Cake.  *#drool*
/u/VeteranRook, I'm a 13-year convert raised Assemblies of God.  I had the same issue; it was my only and last hang-up.  It was described very well by /u/chan_kohaku.  I just wanted to let you know you weren't alone in questioning this.
This needs to be on the front page.  That was frickin' amazing!
Wow... that was pretty bad.  Hopefully, it's just chalked up to live conditions and not the fact that they're just frickin' too old to do this now.  Jeez!
Ugh--same here.  I can't stand that shit.

Haha!  You know what I mean!
Yep, same here.  And she isn't as attractive as I remember her bring.  Now, she comes off as just being needy and whiney.
Yep--same here.
Tim Gunn Has A Question!
Go back to 4chan.
Obi-Faht Somewhere-Elsei... you're my only hope... damnit...
Yep.  [MyFitnessPal](http://www.MyFitnessPall.com) has helped me tremendously.  I'm on day 210 today.
I won't lie; that was pretty damn cool.
To paraphrase Ronald Regan:  I didnt leave the Republican party, the Republican Party left me.  Don't get me wrong, I can't STAND Democrats, but I've slowly started hating Republicans more and more since I turned 18 back in 1999.  They're all talk, and no action.  The "Republican" candidates that do get into office are so middle-of-the-road, that nothing happens.  I think I will now consider myself a Conservative Libertarian.  Screw the (D)/(R) parties.  I'm sick of this crap.
Canadian Brass - "Carnival of Venice" [Live] Probably the most technically-difficult trumpet song I have heard in my 22+ years playing trumpet.
