I'd be interested to know how enforceable they are, actually. After all, if your contract says "You are not allowed to make sandwiches for a competitor for 2 years" but the only thing you know how to do is make sandwiches, then the contract is effectively denying you your livelihood. In the US, the contract would probably win, but in the UK, it would not.  I guess it would be argued that all three of them (but especially Clarkson) /have/ done non-automotive related shows before and they could make a living doing something else for a couple of years, but I'd very much doubt it. On the other hand, if it meant Clarkson was forced to spend two years making more war documentaries, then I'm all for it :)
Nah, it's just a programme about cars where the three blokes who make it are moving on and some other bloke will start again next year. Stuff changes, and it really isn't worth over dramatising. In fact, I'm pretty sure that a BBC trail for Gardener's World or some such would probably fit well with previous comments made by the (now old) team regarding not over dramatising such matters.  Now if you want a /proper/ ending, try the last episode of Blackadder 4...they certainly didn't talk over that one!
Glorious!
Don't mean to disagree, but while most cars in Europe /are/ manual, many premium marques are predominantly automatic. In fact, when I was shopping last year, finding a manual 5 series was nearly impossible.  (Bought an auto anyway - hey, the residuals are better :-)
What elephant?
Apart from me. I'm fucking awesome, me.  (Sorry)
Nope. So much nope.
Actually, I'm assuming that long term we'd see RB pull out of racing (Toro Rossi to Renault? RB to Audi?) and they'd be left just running the sport....like they do for loads and loads of other niche activity sports. The Red Bull Air Race series is properly cool and in case you've not checked, the city venues read like an F1 wishlist!   Who do you prefer? The Red Bull F1 Championship run by someone who has proven track record in actually caring what the spectacle looks like, or the CVC F1 Championship, run 100% to make money for CVC, without exception.  I think I know which seat my backside is sat on!
It's a strange thing, but while I was on honeymoon in NZ (I'm from the UK normally!), I popped into a large bookstore in Wellington and there in front of me was a brand new Matthew Reilly book that I didn't even know was coming! It was the first Jack West novel and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it during the rest of our holiday and on the way home. Funny how things like this stick in your mind nearly 10 years later!  If you could bring any under-recognised novel (or series of novels) to the big screen, which would it be? And no, you can't pick your own!  Best wishes from the UK!
How awful :-(  It sounds like the driver was unconscious at the time. Not sure of his condition, but if it were me, I'm not sure I'd want to come back...
Not the smallest regret, not even for a minute. And I suspect others would agree here.
I love that he wasn't going to bother taking the black, but when he did, potted it like he was on a pub pool table.  For raw talent, the best there has ever been by a country mile.
Any mirrors?
Thank you. It's a strange thing, but if you asked them, I'm sure most customers would also be proud of it.   We Brits can be a strange bunch, but you can always spot us shaking our head at "5 queues for 5 tills" when travelling abroad. It just doesn't happen here...we'd automatically and without a single word being said, create a single master queue feeding all 5 tills in a fair and equal way.  Love it :-)
Wireshark. Unquestionably the most useful tool in any IT admins tool bag.  Not free, but I'd rather use a Mac than be without ALTAP Salamander. Any two pane file explorer would be better than nothing though :-) A few people mentioned windirstat, but the functionality is baked right into AS so I never miss it :-)
Couple of things to note:  1. I always start out writing a select statement that returns the rows that I want to modify, and then changing it to an update. Paranoia always wins :) 2. MySQL has a not well known startup flag that disables unqualified delete or update statements (i.e. where you've forgotten the "where" clause). Amusingly, it's "--i-am-a-dummy" :)  Otherwise, this made me spit my tea on my keyboard. Certainly, an IT guy's idea of horror - give me hairy monsters and vampires any day!
