I said in the recipe I posted you need to cook it for at least an hour. It was a 1.5 pound rack so yes an hour in the sous vide brought the internal temp to 125F... exactly what I had my water bath set to. You do not want to cook certain meats for extended periods of time or they will get mushy. That is why I recommended 1-3 hours. For a cheap cut like a short rib or brisket, they can be sous vide up to 72 hours to break down the collagen and tenderize the meat
Eh, I like my meat rare. This is cooked to 125F (rare is 120-130F for lamb). Also haven't died from E. Coli poisoning yet so there's that

here's another dish I posted a while back... I think you may like the plating a little more  http://i.imgur.com/9XOx56o.jpg
Remington 700 SPS Varmint chambered in 308.  I upgraded the stock to a Bell and Carlson Medalist Tactical/Varmint Style 2. Didn't really like the X-mark pro trigger so I swapped it out with a Timney 512.   Optic is a Vortex Viper HS-T 6-24x50 SFP with milrad reticle. The mount is a Nightforce one-piece direct mount, 20 MOA.  Lastly is the Harris bipod, 9-13 inch.   This is my first bolt-action and I'm looking forward to getting to know it and shooting a bunch to work on my accuracy. It will mainly only be used as a target gun.
Amazing!
Oh got it. I'll keep that in mind for next time!

I got mine from farsports. 38mm front and 50mm rear, 650 shipped and they came in at 1290 grams. I've put about 1300 miles on them and haven't had a single issue. Even braking is pretty good (assuming you have a decent set of brakes... I have ultegra 6700 on my bike)
